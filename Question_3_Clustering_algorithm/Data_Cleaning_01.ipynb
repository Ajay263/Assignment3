Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. Mr Bessent said he looked forward to rebalancing the international economic system to better serve the interests of the US. \\\"My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,\\\" he said in an interview with Fox News. \\\"If the United States wants to resolve the issue through negotiations, it must face up to the serious negative impact of unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world,\\\" a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday morning. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. The report added that China is open to talks but reiterated that if the country decides to continue to fight this trade war \\u2013 it will fight to the end. The trade war has triggered turmoil in financial markets and sent shockwaves across global trade. Two trade experts told the BBC that they were not particularly optimistic about the talks, at least in the initial phase. \\\"You have to start somewhere, so I'm not saying it isn't worthwhile. Just unlikely to be the launch event people are hoping to see,\\\" said Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation. \\\"We should expect to see a lot of back and forth, just like what happened last time in 2018,\\\" Henry Gao, Professor of Law at Singapore Management University and a former Chinese lawyer on the World Trade Organization secretariat said. \\\"I would expect the talks to drag on for several months or even more than a year\\\". Financial markets in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news as well as announcements by Chinese authorities of measures to support the economy. US stock futures were also higher. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date and are an indication of how markets will trade when they open. Investors are also waiting for the US central bank to make its latest announcement on interest rates on Wednesday afternoon.

The British government said the \\\"landmark\\\" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and \\\"deliver for British people and business\\\". Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled \\u00a342.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional \\u00a325.5bn a year by 2040. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was \\\"ambitious and mutually beneficial\\\". The pact would help \\\"catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies\\\", he said in a post on social media platform X. Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said. That includes lower tariffs on: The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: The British government said the deal was the \\\"biggest and most economically significant\\\" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were \\\"massive\\\". \",\n          \"Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at \\u00a32.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. \\\"The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce,\\\" the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was \\\"very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business\\\". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was \\\"transformative\\\". \\\"The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition.\\\" The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about \\u00a3172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about \\u00a32bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some \\u00a38bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to \\\"squeeze out\\\" rivals such as Just Eat and \\\"rattle Uber\\\" in the UK. \\\"The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top,\\\" he added. \\\"With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. Mr Bessent said he looked forward to rebalancing the international economic system to better serve the interests of the US. \\\"My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,\\\" he said in an interview with Fox News. \\\"If the United States wants to resolve the issue through negotiations, it must face up to the serious negative impact of unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world,\\\" a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday morning. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. The report added that China is open to talks but reiterated that if the country decides to continue to fight this trade war \\u2013 it will fight to the end. The trade war has triggered turmoil in financial markets and sent shockwaves across global trade. Two trade experts told the BBC that they were not particularly optimistic about the talks, at least in the initial phase. \\\"You have to start somewhere, so I'm not saying it isn't worthwhile. Just unlikely to be the launch event people are hoping to see,\\\" said Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation. \\\"We should expect to see a lot of back and forth, just like what happened last time in 2018,\\\" Henry Gao, Professor of Law at Singapore Management University and a former Chinese lawyer on the World Trade Organization secretariat said. \\\"I would expect the talks to drag on for several months or even more than a year\\\". Financial markets in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news as well as announcements by Chinese authorities of measures to support the economy. US stock futures were also higher. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date and are an indication of how markets will trade when they open. Investors are also waiting for the US central bank to make its latest announcement on interest rates on Wednesday afternoon.

The British government said the \\\"landmark\\\" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and \\\"deliver for British people and business\\\". Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled \\u00a342.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional \\u00a325.5bn a year by 2040. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was \\\"ambitious and mutually beneficial\\\". The pact would help \\\"catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies\\\", he said in a post on social media platform X. Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said. That includes lower tariffs on: The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: The British government said the deal was the \\\"biggest and most economically significant\\\" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were \\\"massive\\\". \",\n          \"Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at \\u00a32.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. \\\"The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce,\\\" the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was \\\"very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business\\\". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was \\\"transformative\\\". \\\"The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition.\\\" The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about \\u00a3172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about \\u00a32bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some \\u00a38bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to \\\"squeeze out\\\" rivals such as Just Eat and \\\"rattle Uber\\\" in the UK. \\\"The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top,\\\" he added. \\\"With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \\u201cpie in the sky ambition\\u201d was to play Superman. At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \\u201cThe Politician\\u201d and \\u201cHollywood.\\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him. But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\\u2019s \\u201cSuperman\\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he\\u2019d manifested it into existence. \\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \\u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \\u2018Oh, who wouldn\\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\\u2019\\u201d Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\\u2019s movie \\u201cPearl.\\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too. \\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \\u2018Pearl.\\u2019 He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \\u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\\u2019\\u201d That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \\u201cextensive,\\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \\u201csatisfying audition processes\\u201d he\\u2019s ever gone through \\u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer. Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him. \\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\\u201d When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course. \\u201cShe texted, \\u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cI said, \\u2018Yes. Super good news.\\u2019\\u201d It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\\u2019s, which he called a \\u201cmarvel of engineering.\\u201d But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \\u201cwonderfully mundane.\\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role. \\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\\u201d The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew. \\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \\u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\\u2019t that fond of me,\\u2019\\u201d he laughed. \\u201cThat\\u2019s when it hits you.\\u201d Gunn, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, and Corenswet at CinemaCon in April. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\\u2019s Superman. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a public facing character, he\\u2019s a symbol,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\\u201d To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\\u20198\\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \\u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s this big presence, but he\\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\\u201d Gunn has promised that the film is \\u201ca personal journey for Superman that\\u2019s entirely new.\\u201d He\\u2019s a character who is \\u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\\u2019s Lois Lane \\u2014 but there\\u2019s even a different spin on that. \\u201cHe\\u2019s in love with her,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\\u201d Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \\u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \\u201cHis Girl Friday\\u201d was also a big reference with \\u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\\u201d (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\\u2019s been in big movies before, including \\u201cTwisters.\\u201d But being Superman is different. \\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\\u201d Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point. \\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\\u201d ___ For more on this year\\u2019s summer movie season, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/movies\",\n          \"For a long, sun-addled stretch, Lorcan Finnegan\\u2019s beach-set \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d simmers as a deliciously punishing nightmare, driving Nicolas Cage into his most natural state: a boil. \\u201cDon\\u2019t live here, don\\u2019t surf here,\\u201d is the slogan at a pristine stretch of beach along Luna Bay on the Australian coast where our unnamed protagonist (Cage) has come to surf with his teenage son (Finn Little). The \\u201clocals only\\u201d signs, though, don\\u2019t deter him. He was born there, and has come back to surf the break and show his son the million-dollar house on the hills nearby he plans to buy. But the situation rapidly disintegrates. He\\u2019s roughed up by the pushy local surfers, his son takes off, and one issue after another keeps him stuck there on a hillside overlooking the ocean. Anyone who comes to \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d expecting glamorous photography of perfectly tubular waves will be disappointed. This is a movie that gets a remarkable amount of mileage out of a parking lot. It also belongs to that small niche of films where things get so unbearably terrible for the protagonist that the psychodrama becomes more a matter of endurance than pure entertainment. I\\u2019m thinking of movies like \\u201cU-turn\\u201d or \\u201cAffliction\\u201d \\u2014 films where a character\\u2019s inability to reckon with their reality spirals miserably. As time wears on, Cage\\u2019s character gets bloodied, sunburned and incredibly thirsty, and the film grows hallucinatory and surreal. There are snakes, rats and bird eggs. The Lexus he arrives in is towed. His suit gets dusty and ripped. Small nuisances \\u2014 a dead cellphone battery \\u2014 accumulate. The sun seems to be melting his brain, so much so that he\\u2019s no longer sure of who he is, and we start to doubt what\\u2019s real, too. What\\u2019s happening here? The Surfer, as he\\u2019s credited, is hell-bent on reclaiming something. He envisions reuniting with his family at the new house, but his separated wife, on the phone, tells him she wants a divorce. Is \\u201cThe Surfer,\\u201d penned by Thomas Martin, a metaphor for knowing when to cut bait? Cage\\u2019s character won\\u2019t accept his loses, and so he ultimately comes to risk much more. When Finnegan begins to answer these questions in a third act that brings us closer to the surfer bros on the beach, \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d becomes more tolerable to watch and yet less transfixing. The beach gang, led by a man named Scally (Julian McMahon), are something of a cult for reviving an old-fashioned idea of masculinity. With this turn, the strong undertow of \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d dissipates. But if there was ever an actor to elevate pulpy, not-fully formed genre material, it\\u2019s Cage. His performance of a man brought to near-disintegration can be neatly filed alongside Cage\\u2019s many other head trips to the brink. All he needs is a bluff above a beach to make \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d churn with the currents of a man tenuously close to being swept out to sea. \\u201cThe Surfer,\\u201d a Roadside Attractions release that\\u2019s in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language, suicide, some violence, drug content and sexual material. Running time: 103 minutes. Three stars out of four.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Michael Henry Adams had reached a fashion crossroads by the early 1970s: As bell bottoms and afros became the trend and the look of film figures like John Shaft and \\u201cSuper Fly\\u201d became style prototypes, the teenager felt unrepresented. But a previous trip to the Museum of Modern Art, for its \\u201cHarlem On My Mind\\u201d exhibit, had already begun to lay down his fashion foundation. \\u201cWhen I saw those photographs of elegant Harlemites promenading up and down Seventh Avenue and Lennox Avenue ... the raccoon coats and fox coats, and spangled gowns, and bowler hats \\u2014 all this satirical splendor ... I thought, \\u2018Oh! There is another way for me to be authentically Black,\\u2019\\u201d recalled the New York-based cultural and architectural historian, now 69. The style Adams would embrace had a name: dandyism. And dandyism was at the heart of Monday\\u2019s Met Gala, where many of the world\\u2019s most famous and influential tastemakers donned their luxury best to kick off the \\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\\u201d exhibit. But Black dandyism isn\\u2019t limited to expensive couture \\u2014 it\\u2019s displayed daily. Cultural and architectural historian Michael Henry Adams poses for a portrait on Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) \\u201cIt\\u2019s everywhere in the Black community, the notion of what a dandy is,\\u201d explained Adams, who was photographed for the \\u201cSuperfine\\u201d catalog. \\u201cThe ingeniousness and ingenuity and creativity of Black people, so far as fashion was concerned, it\\u2019s always been with us.\\u201d As the menswear-focused exhibit \\u2014 the Costume Institute\\u2019s first to exclusively display Black designers \\u2014 opens to the public Saturday, here are tips from dandies on embracing the style in everyday life. Dandies say the key to a distinctive look first begins on the inside. \\u201cFashion\\u2019s a sense of personality. Two guys can go to the same store and get the same outfit and look totally different,\\u201d said Guy Wood, 62, the stylish co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. Inspired by family members and dapper Harlem neighbors, he developed a knack for style early. \\u201cIt\\u2019s confidence ... you walk in the room, and all the heads turn.\\u201d Michael Andrew, a 42-year-old Atlanta-based style consultant, first delved into dandyism after being inspired by Fonzworth Bentley, most recognized as Sean \\u201cDiddy\\u201d Combs\\u2019 often-photographed assistant and umbrella holder in the early 2000s. Bentley\\u2019s colorful outfits and tailored outfits separated himself from the hip-hop era\\u2019s prevalent baggy look. Style advisor, Michael Andrew, poses for a portrait on Friday, May 2, 2025, in Atlanta. (Photo by Paul R. Giunta/Invision/AP) \\u201cA lot of guys think that being a dandy is about being over the top,\\u201d said Andrew, who was photographed for Rose Callahan\\u2019s 2013 book \\u201cI Am Dandy: The Return of the Elegant Gentleman.\\u201d \\u201cFor me, dandyism is the highest form of taste with self-expression.\\u201d The foundation of dandyism rests upon tenets such as bold colors and fine tailoring, but there\\u2019s no singular way to achieve the look. Each dandy creates their own unique style, often centered on specific elements. For Wood, who refers to crafting looks as making gumbo, it starts with suits. \\u201cWearing a suit, you just feel important,\\u201d said Wood, who often pairs them with brogue shoes of various bright colors. \\u201cWe love well-tailored.\\u201d James McFarland, an 80-year-old master tailor, says a dandy\\u2019s affinity for tailoring is easy to understand: \\u201cIt\\u2019s very simple: we\\u2019re a visual world. When you wear something that\\u2019s fine tailored and it\\u2019s fitting you well, people look at that.\\u201d Known as \\u201cGentleman Jim,\\u201d McFarland was tutored by Orie Walls, the go-to Harlem-based tailor of the 1960s. McFarland says they crafted suits for nearly every famous Black male celebrity of the time, from Duke Ellington to Jackie Robinson to Muhammad Ali \\u2014 as well as some of the era\\u2019s most infamous characters, like gangsters Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson. He says wearing a suit \\u201cmakes you feel better. You ever heard the term styling and profiling?\\u201d While Adams, the historian, is drawn to bow ties, buck shoes and straw hats, Andrew says the beauty of dandyism is making it your own. \\u201cTexture is the must-have when you start talking about dandyism \\u2014 textures and patterns. The great point here is that dandies always have their thing. And so, for me, hats are my thing,\\u201d Andrew said, adding that small accessories, like stylish wool or cashmere socks and pocket squares, can easily elevate a look. \\u201cNow, it\\u2019s starting to become glasses. \\u2026 Every dandy has the opportunity to utilize something.\\u201d Guy Wood, co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) Wood says creativity is essential to becoming a dandy \\u2014 not a high income. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a cheat code,\\u201d said Wood. \\u201cIt is being creative \\u2026 most of us don\\u2019t have a lot of money. You might go in your mom\\u2019s closet and (think), \\u2018Oh, that scarf is fly.\\u2019 You tie it around your neck and lay it over your shoulder. You just can\\u2019t be scared.\\u201d Adams says while style and inspiration can go hand-in-hand, individuality should always be paramount. \\u201cPeople should find their truth and aspire to look like themselves,\\u201d he said, noting he shops at a variety of stores, from the high-end Brooks Brothers to off-price and discount stores like Marshalls and K&G Fashion. \\u201cPart of the thing that made me rebel against looking like \\u2018Super Fly\\u2019 or \\u2018Shaft\\u2019 is I didn\\u2019t want to look like everybody else.\\u201d Jacques Agbobly, a designer whose clothes are featured in the Met exhibit, agrees. \\u201cThere are people who would really just think it\\u2019s about the suit that you\\u2019re wearing and the top hat \\u2026 but for me, and I think that\\u2019s what this exhibition does really fondly, is really putting together a group of amazing clothing that really redefines what dandyism is,\\u201d he said. For the Togo-born designer, \\u201ctaking up space is a sort of open-ended thing in a way,\\u201d whether it\\u2019s achieved through colors, silhouettes or fabric choices. Rising designer Jacques Agbobly (AP video shot by Joseph Frederick, AP interview/production by Gary Gerard Hamilton) A general consensus among dandies is that society has embraced casualness, shunning the well-dressed looks of the past. McFarland, the tailor, says his profession isn\\u2019t as admired or used in U.S. as it was years ago. He teaches fine tailoring as he has for decades, and is planning to start a podcast to discuss the craft and his adventures styling celebrities of his era. \\u201cWhen I grew up, I wanted to look like the people in the neighborhood,\\u201d he said, explaining his mother couldn\\u2019t afford the clothes he wanted, leading him to tailoring. \\u201cEverybody, male and female, was dressed up.\\u201d Andrew hopes that same stylish spirit of yesteryear can make a resurgence, believing appearance and pride work together. \\u201cI would challenge or would encourage all of us, especially as Black people, to remember our history, to remember that we used to throw on our Sunday\\u2019s best,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe wanted to show up as the best versions of ourselves.\\u201d The \\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\\u201d exhibit, which will run through October, is sure to introduce visitors to the most elevated forms of Black dandyism. But for Wood and fellow daily dandies, it\\u2019s just business as usual. \\u201cThe fact that the Met realizes that is a beautiful thing,\\u201d he said with a sly smile. \\u201cBut we\\u2019ve been doing this forever and we really not paying attention to it. We just do it because we love it.\\u201d ___ Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"published_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \\u201cpie in the sky ambition\\u201d was to play Superman. At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \\u201cThe Politician\\u201d and \\u201cHollywood.\\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him. But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\\u2019s \\u201cSuperman\\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he\\u2019d manifested it into existence. \\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \\u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \\u2018Oh, who wouldn\\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\\u2019\\u201d Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\\u2019s movie \\u201cPearl.\\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too. \\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \\u2018Pearl.\\u2019 He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \\u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\\u2019\\u201d That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \\u201cextensive,\\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \\u201csatisfying audition processes\\u201d he\\u2019s ever gone through \\u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer. Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him. \\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\\u201d When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course. \\u201cShe texted, \\u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cI said, \\u2018Yes. Super good news.\\u2019\\u201d It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\\u2019s, which he called a \\u201cmarvel of engineering.\\u201d But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \\u201cwonderfully mundane.\\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role. \\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\\u201d The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew. \\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \\u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\\u2019t that fond of me,\\u2019\\u201d he laughed. \\u201cThat\\u2019s when it hits you.\\u201d Gunn, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, and Corenswet at CinemaCon in April. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\\u2019s Superman. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a public facing character, he\\u2019s a symbol,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\\u201d To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\\u20198\\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \\u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s this big presence, but he\\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\\u201d Gunn has promised that the film is \\u201ca personal journey for Superman that\\u2019s entirely new.\\u201d He\\u2019s a character who is \\u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\\u2019s Lois Lane \\u2014 but there\\u2019s even a different spin on that. \\u201cHe\\u2019s in love with her,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\\u201d Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \\u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \\u201cHis Girl Friday\\u201d was also a big reference with \\u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\\u201d (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\\u2019s been in big movies before, including \\u201cTwisters.\\u201d But being Superman is different. \\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\\u201d Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point. \\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\\u201d ___ For more on this year\\u2019s summer movie season, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/movies\",\n          \"For a long, sun-addled stretch, Lorcan Finnegan\\u2019s beach-set \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d simmers as a deliciously punishing nightmare, driving Nicolas Cage into his most natural state: a boil. \\u201cDon\\u2019t live here, don\\u2019t surf here,\\u201d is the slogan at a pristine stretch of beach along Luna Bay on the Australian coast where our unnamed protagonist (Cage) has come to surf with his teenage son (Finn Little). The \\u201clocals only\\u201d signs, though, don\\u2019t deter him. He was born there, and has come back to surf the break and show his son the million-dollar house on the hills nearby he plans to buy. But the situation rapidly disintegrates. He\\u2019s roughed up by the pushy local surfers, his son takes off, and one issue after another keeps him stuck there on a hillside overlooking the ocean. Anyone who comes to \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d expecting glamorous photography of perfectly tubular waves will be disappointed. This is a movie that gets a remarkable amount of mileage out of a parking lot. It also belongs to that small niche of films where things get so unbearably terrible for the protagonist that the psychodrama becomes more a matter of endurance than pure entertainment. I\\u2019m thinking of movies like \\u201cU-turn\\u201d or \\u201cAffliction\\u201d \\u2014 films where a character\\u2019s inability to reckon with their reality spirals miserably. As time wears on, Cage\\u2019s character gets bloodied, sunburned and incredibly thirsty, and the film grows hallucinatory and surreal. There are snakes, rats and bird eggs. The Lexus he arrives in is towed. His suit gets dusty and ripped. Small nuisances \\u2014 a dead cellphone battery \\u2014 accumulate. The sun seems to be melting his brain, so much so that he\\u2019s no longer sure of who he is, and we start to doubt what\\u2019s real, too. What\\u2019s happening here? The Surfer, as he\\u2019s credited, is hell-bent on reclaiming something. He envisions reuniting with his family at the new house, but his separated wife, on the phone, tells him she wants a divorce. Is \\u201cThe Surfer,\\u201d penned by Thomas Martin, a metaphor for knowing when to cut bait? Cage\\u2019s character won\\u2019t accept his loses, and so he ultimately comes to risk much more. When Finnegan begins to answer these questions in a third act that brings us closer to the surfer bros on the beach, \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d becomes more tolerable to watch and yet less transfixing. The beach gang, led by a man named Scally (Julian McMahon), are something of a cult for reviving an old-fashioned idea of masculinity. With this turn, the strong undertow of \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d dissipates. But if there was ever an actor to elevate pulpy, not-fully formed genre material, it\\u2019s Cage. His performance of a man brought to near-disintegration can be neatly filed alongside Cage\\u2019s many other head trips to the brink. All he needs is a bluff above a beach to make \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d churn with the currents of a man tenuously close to being swept out to sea. \\u201cThe Surfer,\\u201d a Roadside Attractions release that\\u2019s in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language, suicide, some violence, drug content and sexual material. Running time: 103 minutes. Three stars out of four.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Michael Henry Adams had reached a fashion crossroads by the early 1970s: As bell bottoms and afros became the trend and the look of film figures like John Shaft and \\u201cSuper Fly\\u201d became style prototypes, the teenager felt unrepresented. But a previous trip to the Museum of Modern Art, for its \\u201cHarlem On My Mind\\u201d exhibit, had already begun to lay down his fashion foundation. \\u201cWhen I saw those photographs of elegant Harlemites promenading up and down Seventh Avenue and Lennox Avenue ... the raccoon coats and fox coats, and spangled gowns, and bowler hats \\u2014 all this satirical splendor ... I thought, \\u2018Oh! There is another way for me to be authentically Black,\\u2019\\u201d recalled the New York-based cultural and architectural historian, now 69. The style Adams would embrace had a name: dandyism. And dandyism was at the heart of Monday\\u2019s Met Gala, where many of the world\\u2019s most famous and influential tastemakers donned their luxury best to kick off the \\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\\u201d exhibit. But Black dandyism isn\\u2019t limited to expensive couture \\u2014 it\\u2019s displayed daily. Cultural and architectural historian Michael Henry Adams poses for a portrait on Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) \\u201cIt\\u2019s everywhere in the Black community, the notion of what a dandy is,\\u201d explained Adams, who was photographed for the \\u201cSuperfine\\u201d catalog. \\u201cThe ingeniousness and ingenuity and creativity of Black people, so far as fashion was concerned, it\\u2019s always been with us.\\u201d As the menswear-focused exhibit \\u2014 the Costume Institute\\u2019s first to exclusively display Black designers \\u2014 opens to the public Saturday, here are tips from dandies on embracing the style in everyday life. Dandies say the key to a distinctive look first begins on the inside. \\u201cFashion\\u2019s a sense of personality. Two guys can go to the same store and get the same outfit and look totally different,\\u201d said Guy Wood, 62, the stylish co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. Inspired by family members and dapper Harlem neighbors, he developed a knack for style early. \\u201cIt\\u2019s confidence ... you walk in the room, and all the heads turn.\\u201d Michael Andrew, a 42-year-old Atlanta-based style consultant, first delved into dandyism after being inspired by Fonzworth Bentley, most recognized as Sean \\u201cDiddy\\u201d Combs\\u2019 often-photographed assistant and umbrella holder in the early 2000s. Bentley\\u2019s colorful outfits and tailored outfits separated himself from the hip-hop era\\u2019s prevalent baggy look. Style advisor, Michael Andrew, poses for a portrait on Friday, May 2, 2025, in Atlanta. (Photo by Paul R. Giunta/Invision/AP) \\u201cA lot of guys think that being a dandy is about being over the top,\\u201d said Andrew, who was photographed for Rose Callahan\\u2019s 2013 book \\u201cI Am Dandy: The Return of the Elegant Gentleman.\\u201d \\u201cFor me, dandyism is the highest form of taste with self-expression.\\u201d The foundation of dandyism rests upon tenets such as bold colors and fine tailoring, but there\\u2019s no singular way to achieve the look. Each dandy creates their own unique style, often centered on specific elements. For Wood, who refers to crafting looks as making gumbo, it starts with suits. \\u201cWearing a suit, you just feel important,\\u201d said Wood, who often pairs them with brogue shoes of various bright colors. \\u201cWe love well-tailored.\\u201d James McFarland, an 80-year-old master tailor, says a dandy\\u2019s affinity for tailoring is easy to understand: \\u201cIt\\u2019s very simple: we\\u2019re a visual world. When you wear something that\\u2019s fine tailored and it\\u2019s fitting you well, people look at that.\\u201d Known as \\u201cGentleman Jim,\\u201d McFarland was tutored by Orie Walls, the go-to Harlem-based tailor of the 1960s. McFarland says they crafted suits for nearly every famous Black male celebrity of the time, from Duke Ellington to Jackie Robinson to Muhammad Ali \\u2014 as well as some of the era\\u2019s most infamous characters, like gangsters Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson. He says wearing a suit \\u201cmakes you feel better. You ever heard the term styling and profiling?\\u201d While Adams, the historian, is drawn to bow ties, buck shoes and straw hats, Andrew says the beauty of dandyism is making it your own. \\u201cTexture is the must-have when you start talking about dandyism \\u2014 textures and patterns. The great point here is that dandies always have their thing. And so, for me, hats are my thing,\\u201d Andrew said, adding that small accessories, like stylish wool or cashmere socks and pocket squares, can easily elevate a look. \\u201cNow, it\\u2019s starting to become glasses. \\u2026 Every dandy has the opportunity to utilize something.\\u201d Guy Wood, co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) Wood says creativity is essential to becoming a dandy \\u2014 not a high income. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a cheat code,\\u201d said Wood. \\u201cIt is being creative \\u2026 most of us don\\u2019t have a lot of money. You might go in your mom\\u2019s closet and (think), \\u2018Oh, that scarf is fly.\\u2019 You tie it around your neck and lay it over your shoulder. You just can\\u2019t be scared.\\u201d Adams says while style and inspiration can go hand-in-hand, individuality should always be paramount. \\u201cPeople should find their truth and aspire to look like themselves,\\u201d he said, noting he shops at a variety of stores, from the high-end Brooks Brothers to off-price and discount stores like Marshalls and K&G Fashion. \\u201cPart of the thing that made me rebel against looking like \\u2018Super Fly\\u2019 or \\u2018Shaft\\u2019 is I didn\\u2019t want to look like everybody else.\\u201d Jacques Agbobly, a designer whose clothes are featured in the Met exhibit, agrees. \\u201cThere are people who would really just think it\\u2019s about the suit that you\\u2019re wearing and the top hat \\u2026 but for me, and I think that\\u2019s what this exhibition does really fondly, is really putting together a group of amazing clothing that really redefines what dandyism is,\\u201d he said. For the Togo-born designer, \\u201ctaking up space is a sort of open-ended thing in a way,\\u201d whether it\\u2019s achieved through colors, silhouettes or fabric choices. Rising designer Jacques Agbobly (AP video shot by Joseph Frederick, AP interview/production by Gary Gerard Hamilton) A general consensus among dandies is that society has embraced casualness, shunning the well-dressed looks of the past. McFarland, the tailor, says his profession isn\\u2019t as admired or used in U.S. as it was years ago. He teaches fine tailoring as he has for decades, and is planning to start a podcast to discuss the craft and his adventures styling celebrities of his era. \\u201cWhen I grew up, I wanted to look like the people in the neighborhood,\\u201d he said, explaining his mother couldn\\u2019t afford the clothes he wanted, leading him to tailoring. \\u201cEverybody, male and female, was dressed up.\\u201d Andrew hopes that same stylish spirit of yesteryear can make a resurgence, believing appearance and pride work together. \\u201cI would challenge or would encourage all of us, especially as Black people, to remember our history, to remember that we used to throw on our Sunday\\u2019s best,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe wanted to show up as the best versions of ourselves.\\u201d The \\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\\u201d exhibit, which will run through October, is sure to introduce visitors to the most elevated forms of Black dandyism. But for Wood and fellow daily dandies, it\\u2019s just business as usual. \\u201cThe fact that the Met realizes that is a beautiful thing,\\u201d he said with a sly smile. \\u201cBut we\\u2019ve been doing this forever and we really not paying attention to it. We just do it because we love it.\\u201d ___ Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \\u201cpie in the sky ambition\\u201d was to play Superman. At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \\u201cThe Politician\\u201d and \\u201cHollywood.\\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him. But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\\u2019s \\u201cSuperman\\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he\\u2019d manifested it into existence. \\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \\u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \\u2018Oh, who wouldn\\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\\u2019\\u201d Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\\u2019s movie \\u201cPearl.\\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too. \\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \\u2018Pearl.\\u2019 He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \\u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\\u2019\\u201d That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \\u201cextensive,\\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \\u201csatisfying audition processes\\u201d he\\u2019s ever gone through \\u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer. Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him. \\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\\u201d When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course. \\u201cShe texted, \\u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cI said, \\u2018Yes. Super good news.\\u2019\\u201d It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\\u2019s, which he called a \\u201cmarvel of engineering.\\u201d But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \\u201cwonderfully mundane.\\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role. \\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\\u201d The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew. \\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \\u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\\u2019t that fond of me,\\u2019\\u201d he laughed. \\u201cThat\\u2019s when it hits you.\\u201d Gunn, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, and Corenswet at CinemaCon in April. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\\u2019s Superman. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a public facing character, he\\u2019s a symbol,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\\u201d To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\\u20198\\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \\u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\\u201d Corenswet said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s this big presence, but he\\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\\u201d Gunn has promised that the film is \\u201ca personal journey for Superman that\\u2019s entirely new.\\u201d He\\u2019s a character who is \\u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\\u2019s Lois Lane \\u2014 but there\\u2019s even a different spin on that. \\u201cHe\\u2019s in love with her,\\u201d Gunn said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\\u201d Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \\u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \\u201cHis Girl Friday\\u201d was also a big reference with \\u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\\u201d (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\\u2019s been in big movies before, including \\u201cTwisters.\\u201d But being Superman is different. \\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\\u201d Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point. \\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\\u201d ___ For more on this year\\u2019s summer movie season, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/movies\",\n          \"For a long, sun-addled stretch, Lorcan Finnegan\\u2019s beach-set \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d simmers as a deliciously punishing nightmare, driving Nicolas Cage into his most natural state: a boil. \\u201cDon\\u2019t live here, don\\u2019t surf here,\\u201d is the slogan at a pristine stretch of beach along Luna Bay on the Australian coast where our unnamed protagonist (Cage) has come to surf with his teenage son (Finn Little). The \\u201clocals only\\u201d signs, though, don\\u2019t deter him. He was born there, and has come back to surf the break and show his son the million-dollar house on the hills nearby he plans to buy. But the situation rapidly disintegrates. He\\u2019s roughed up by the pushy local surfers, his son takes off, and one issue after another keeps him stuck there on a hillside overlooking the ocean. Anyone who comes to \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d expecting glamorous photography of perfectly tubular waves will be disappointed. This is a movie that gets a remarkable amount of mileage out of a parking lot. It also belongs to that small niche of films where things get so unbearably terrible for the protagonist that the psychodrama becomes more a matter of endurance than pure entertainment. I\\u2019m thinking of movies like \\u201cU-turn\\u201d or \\u201cAffliction\\u201d \\u2014 films where a character\\u2019s inability to reckon with their reality spirals miserably. As time wears on, Cage\\u2019s character gets bloodied, sunburned and incredibly thirsty, and the film grows hallucinatory and surreal. There are snakes, rats and bird eggs. The Lexus he arrives in is towed. His suit gets dusty and ripped. Small nuisances \\u2014 a dead cellphone battery \\u2014 accumulate. The sun seems to be melting his brain, so much so that he\\u2019s no longer sure of who he is, and we start to doubt what\\u2019s real, too. What\\u2019s happening here? The Surfer, as he\\u2019s credited, is hell-bent on reclaiming something. He envisions reuniting with his family at the new house, but his separated wife, on the phone, tells him she wants a divorce. Is \\u201cThe Surfer,\\u201d penned by Thomas Martin, a metaphor for knowing when to cut bait? Cage\\u2019s character won\\u2019t accept his loses, and so he ultimately comes to risk much more. When Finnegan begins to answer these questions in a third act that brings us closer to the surfer bros on the beach, \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d becomes more tolerable to watch and yet less transfixing. The beach gang, led by a man named Scally (Julian McMahon), are something of a cult for reviving an old-fashioned idea of masculinity. With this turn, the strong undertow of \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d dissipates. But if there was ever an actor to elevate pulpy, not-fully formed genre material, it\\u2019s Cage. His performance of a man brought to near-disintegration can be neatly filed alongside Cage\\u2019s many other head trips to the brink. All he needs is a bluff above a beach to make \\u201cThe Surfer\\u201d churn with the currents of a man tenuously close to being swept out to sea. \\u201cThe Surfer,\\u201d a Roadside Attractions release that\\u2019s in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language, suicide, some violence, drug content and sexual material. Running time: 103 minutes. Three stars out of four.\",\n          \"NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 Michael Henry Adams had reached a fashion crossroads by the early 1970s: As bell bottoms and afros became the trend and the look of film figures like John Shaft and \\u201cSuper Fly\\u201d became style prototypes, the teenager felt unrepresented. But a previous trip to the Museum of Modern Art, for its \\u201cHarlem On My Mind\\u201d exhibit, had already begun to lay down his fashion foundation. \\u201cWhen I saw those photographs of elegant Harlemites promenading up and down Seventh Avenue and Lennox Avenue ... the raccoon coats and fox coats, and spangled gowns, and bowler hats \\u2014 all this satirical splendor ... I thought, \\u2018Oh! There is another way for me to be authentically Black,\\u2019\\u201d recalled the New York-based cultural and architectural historian, now 69. The style Adams would embrace had a name: dandyism. And dandyism was at the heart of Monday\\u2019s Met Gala, where many of the world\\u2019s most famous and influential tastemakers donned their luxury best to kick off the \\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\\u201d exhibit. But Black dandyism isn\\u2019t limited to expensive couture \\u2014 it\\u2019s displayed daily. Cultural and architectural historian Michael Henry Adams poses for a portrait on Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) \\u201cIt\\u2019s everywhere in the Black community, the notion of what a dandy is,\\u201d explained Adams, who was photographed for the \\u201cSuperfine\\u201d catalog. \\u201cThe ingeniousness and ingenuity and creativity of Black people, so far as fashion was concerned, it\\u2019s always been with us.\\u201d As the menswear-focused exhibit \\u2014 the Costume Institute\\u2019s first to exclusively display Black designers \\u2014 opens to the public Saturday, here are tips from dandies on embracing the style in everyday life. Dandies say the key to a distinctive look first begins on the inside. \\u201cFashion\\u2019s a sense of personality. Two guys can go to the same store and get the same outfit and look totally different,\\u201d said Guy Wood, 62, the stylish co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. Inspired by family members and dapper Harlem neighbors, he developed a knack for style early. \\u201cIt\\u2019s confidence ... you walk in the room, and all the heads turn.\\u201d Michael Andrew, a 42-year-old Atlanta-based style consultant, first delved into dandyism after being inspired by Fonzworth Bentley, most recognized as Sean \\u201cDiddy\\u201d Combs\\u2019 often-photographed assistant and umbrella holder in the early 2000s. Bentley\\u2019s colorful outfits and tailored outfits separated himself from the hip-hop era\\u2019s prevalent baggy look. Style advisor, Michael Andrew, poses for a portrait on Friday, May 2, 2025, in Atlanta. (Photo by Paul R. Giunta/Invision/AP) \\u201cA lot of guys think that being a dandy is about being over the top,\\u201d said Andrew, who was photographed for Rose Callahan\\u2019s 2013 book \\u201cI Am Dandy: The Return of the Elegant Gentleman.\\u201d \\u201cFor me, dandyism is the highest form of taste with self-expression.\\u201d The foundation of dandyism rests upon tenets such as bold colors and fine tailoring, but there\\u2019s no singular way to achieve the look. Each dandy creates their own unique style, often centered on specific elements. For Wood, who refers to crafting looks as making gumbo, it starts with suits. \\u201cWearing a suit, you just feel important,\\u201d said Wood, who often pairs them with brogue shoes of various bright colors. \\u201cWe love well-tailored.\\u201d James McFarland, an 80-year-old master tailor, says a dandy\\u2019s affinity for tailoring is easy to understand: \\u201cIt\\u2019s very simple: we\\u2019re a visual world. When you wear something that\\u2019s fine tailored and it\\u2019s fitting you well, people look at that.\\u201d Known as \\u201cGentleman Jim,\\u201d McFarland was tutored by Orie Walls, the go-to Harlem-based tailor of the 1960s. McFarland says they crafted suits for nearly every famous Black male celebrity of the time, from Duke Ellington to Jackie Robinson to Muhammad Ali \\u2014 as well as some of the era\\u2019s most infamous characters, like gangsters Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson. He says wearing a suit \\u201cmakes you feel better. You ever heard the term styling and profiling?\\u201d While Adams, the historian, is drawn to bow ties, buck shoes and straw hats, Andrew says the beauty of dandyism is making it your own. \\u201cTexture is the must-have when you start talking about dandyism \\u2014 textures and patterns. The great point here is that dandies always have their thing. And so, for me, hats are my thing,\\u201d Andrew said, adding that small accessories, like stylish wool or cashmere socks and pocket squares, can easily elevate a look. \\u201cNow, it\\u2019s starting to become glasses. \\u2026 Every dandy has the opportunity to utilize something.\\u201d Guy Wood, co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) Wood says creativity is essential to becoming a dandy \\u2014 not a high income. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a cheat code,\\u201d said Wood. \\u201cIt is being creative \\u2026 most of us don\\u2019t have a lot of money. You might go in your mom\\u2019s closet and (think), \\u2018Oh, that scarf is fly.\\u2019 You tie it around your neck and lay it over your shoulder. You just can\\u2019t be scared.\\u201d Adams says while style and inspiration can go hand-in-hand, individuality should always be paramount. \\u201cPeople should find their truth and aspire to look like themselves,\\u201d he said, noting he shops at a variety of stores, from the high-end Brooks Brothers to off-price and discount stores like Marshalls and K&G Fashion. \\u201cPart of the thing that made me rebel against looking like \\u2018Super Fly\\u2019 or \\u2018Shaft\\u2019 is I didn\\u2019t want to look like everybody else.\\u201d Jacques Agbobly, a designer whose clothes are featured in the Met exhibit, agrees. \\u201cThere are people who would really just think it\\u2019s about the suit that you\\u2019re wearing and the top hat \\u2026 but for me, and I think that\\u2019s what this exhibition does really fondly, is really putting together a group of amazing clothing that really redefines what dandyism is,\\u201d he said. For the Togo-born designer, \\u201ctaking up space is a sort of open-ended thing in a way,\\u201d whether it\\u2019s achieved through colors, silhouettes or fabric choices. Rising designer Jacques Agbobly (AP video shot by Joseph Frederick, AP interview/production by Gary Gerard Hamilton) A general consensus among dandies is that society has embraced casualness, shunning the well-dressed looks of the past. McFarland, the tailor, says his profession isn\\u2019t as admired or used in U.S. as it was years ago. He teaches fine tailoring as he has for decades, and is planning to start a podcast to discuss the craft and his adventures styling celebrities of his era. \\u201cWhen I grew up, I wanted to look like the people in the neighborhood,\\u201d he said, explaining his mother couldn\\u2019t afford the clothes he wanted, leading him to tailoring. \\u201cEverybody, male and female, was dressed up.\\u201d Andrew hopes that same stylish spirit of yesteryear can make a resurgence, believing appearance and pride work together. \\u201cI would challenge or would encourage all of us, especially as Black people, to remember our history, to remember that we used to throw on our Sunday\\u2019s best,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe wanted to show up as the best versions of ourselves.\\u201d The \\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\\u201d exhibit, which will run through October, is sure to introduce visitors to the most elevated forms of Black dandyism. But for Wood and fellow daily dandies, it\\u2019s just business as usual. \\u201cThe fact that the Met realizes that is a beautiful thing,\\u201d he said with a sly smile. \\u201cBut we\\u2019ve been doing this forever and we really not paying attention to it. We just do it because we love it.\\u201d ___ Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Nearly two months have passed since a 20-year-old Venezuelan native, known only as Cristian in court filings, was deported to El Salvador despite having a pending asylum application. Now his lawyers want to know if there are others like him. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher stopped short of ordering the Trump administration to produce a list of any others who are in the same legal situation as Cristian. But the judge made it clear during a hearing Tuesday that she won\\u2019t second-guess her earlier order for the Trump administration to facilitate Cristian\\u2019s return to the U.S. Gallagher, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, said it is a \\u201cfair inference\\u201d that the administration has done nothing to comply with her April 23 decision. She gave the government until Thursday to appeal her ruling before she considers ordering specific steps to comply with the order. Gallagher said the case isn\\u2019t about whether Cristian is entitled to asylum if he is able to return to the U.S. \\u201cThe issue is and always has been one of process,\\u201d the judge said. \\u201cPeople are entitled to that.\\u201d Abrego Garcia and Cristian both were deported on March 15. Dozens of other people were flown from the U.S. to El Salvador after Trump issued a proclamation calling for the arrest and removal of Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law. Cristian had been transferred into federal custody from a jail in Harris County, Texas, in January. Abrego Garcia was arrested in Maryland, where he lived with his wife \\u2014 a U.S. citizen \\u2014 and their children. Unlike Cristian, Abrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador. A U.S. immigration judge\\u2019s order in 2019 protected him from being sent there because he likely faced persecution by local Salvadoran gangs that terrorized him and his family. Gallagher ruled that the government violated a 2019 settlement agreement when it deported Cristian. She said she was guided by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis\\u2019 ruling that Trump\\u2019s Republican administration must facilitate Abrego Garcia\\u2019s return. \\u201cStanding by and taking no action is not facilitation,\\u201d Gallagher wrote. \\u201cIn prior cases involving wrongfully removed individuals, courts have ordered, and the government has taken, affirmative steps toward facilitating return.\\u201d Gallagher said her order requires the government to make \\u201ca good faith request\\u201d for the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody. Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia\\u2019s return. The judge set May deadlines this month for administration officials to testify under oath about what they have done to comply. Abrego Garcia\\u2019s attorneys said the administration was moving toward bringing him back when it asked for a pause in the court case last month. \\u201cWe agreed to that request because we understood it to be made in good faith,\\u201d the lawyers said in a news release. \\u201cUnfortunately, one week later, it remains unclear what, if anything, the government has done in the past seven days to bring our client home to his family.\\u201d The Justice Department is likely to appeal Gallagher\\u2019s rulings in Cristian\\u2019s favor. Any appeal would be heard by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime, Gallagher refused Tuesday to suspend her April 23 decision. The judge scheduled Tuesday\\u2019s hearing to find out what, if anything, the government has done to comply with her order to facilitate Cristian\\u2019s return. Justice Department attorney Richard Ingebretsen merely told her that the State Department was notified of her ruling. \\u201cThat is the extent of the information,\\u201d Ingebretsen added. One of Cristian\\u2019s attorneys, Kevin DeJong, dismissed that response as a \\u201cnon-answer\\u201d and expressed concern that the administration is trying to avoid complying with the judge\\u2019s order. Ingebretsen said immigration officials have determined that Cristian isn\\u2019t entitled to asylum. But the man\\u2019s lawyers said he has a right to get a ruling on the merits of his asylum application by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Meanwhile, Cristian\\u2019s lawyers want to know if the U.S. has deported other people who are covered by the same settlement that benefited him. \\u201cThere may well be other class members removed and we don\\u2019t know about it,\\u201d DeJong said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not acceptable.\\u201d\",\n          \"Citizen activists supporting a public vote on important issues could have to brush up on their reading, writing and arithmetic if they want to get their initiatives on next year\\u2019s ballot in some states. A new Arkansas law will bar initiative ballot titles written above an eighth-grade reading level. And canvassers will have to verify that petition signers have either read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them. In South Dakota, sponsors will need to make sure their petition titles appears in 14-point type on the front page and 16-point font on the back, where people typically sign. And in Florida, volunteers will have to register with the state if they gather more than 25 petition signatures from outside their family or risk facing felony charges punishable by up to five years in prison. Across about dozen states, roughly 40 bills restricting or revamping the citizen initiative process have passed at least one legislative chamber this year, according to a review by The Associated Press. Many already have been signed into law. Some advocates for the initiative process are alarmed by the trend. \\u201cGlobally, as there\\u2019s movements to expand direct democracy. In the United States it\\u2019s contracting,\\u201d said Dane Waters, chair of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, who has advised ballot campaigns in over 20 nations. Most of the new restrictions come from Republican lawmakers in states where petitions have been used to place abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other progressive initiatives on the ballot. GOP lawmakers contend their measures are shielding state constitutions from outside interests. \\u201cThis is not a bill to restrict. It is a bill to protect \\u2014 to make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity, and that it\\u2019s free of fraud,\\u201d said state Sen. Jennifer Bradley of Florida, where the new initiative requirements already have been challenged in court. About half the U.S. states allow people to bypass their legislatures by gathering signatures to place proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot. Since Oregon voters first used the process in 1904, a total of 2,744 citizen initiatives have appeared on statewide ballots, with 42% wining approval, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute. But the process has long caused tension between voters and their elected representatives. Lawmakers often perceive the initiative process as \\u201can assault on their power and authority, and they want to limit it,\\u201d Waters said. \\u201cThey view it, in my opinion, as a nuisance \\u2013 a gnat that keeps bothering them.\\u201d Because initiative petitions require thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, groups sponsoring them often pay people to solicit signatures outside shopping centers and public places. Some states now prohibit payments based on the number of signatures gathered. States also are trying to restrict who can circulate petitions. A new Arkansas law requires paid petition canvassers to live in the state. And a new Montana law will make petition circulators wear badges displaying their name and home state. The new Florida law expanding registration requirements for petition circulators also requires them to undergo state training and bars canvassers who are noncitizens, nonresidents or felons without their voting rights restored. In addition to providing their name, address and birth date, people signing initiative petitions in Florida also will have to provide either their Florida driver\\u2019s license, state identification card or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That information is not required in other states, said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that has backed dozens of ballot initiatives in states. Hall said people concerned about privacy might hesitate to sign petitions. \\u201cI work in ballot measures, and I deeply support many of the things that folks have tried to put on the ballot in Florida, \\u201d Hall said, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t know if I could bring myself to do that \\u2013 that\\u2019s a very prohibitive requirement.\\u201d Many states already prescribe a particular format for initiative petitions. South Dakota\\u2019s new mandate for specific font sizes was prompted by allegations that some people got duped into signing a petition for abortion rights last year, said sponsoring state Sen. Amber Hulse, a Republican. Printing the ballot title in large type \\u201cmight make it harder for some issues to get on the ballot if people know what they\\u2019re signing. But that\\u2019s actually a good thing,\\u201d Hulse said. Before they can collect signatures, petition sponsors must get approval from state officials. New measures in several states give those officials greater authority. New Arkansas laws allow the attorney general to reject initiatives written above an eighth-grade reading level or which conflict with the U.S. Constitution or federal law. Utah\\u2019s lieutenant governor, who already can reject unconstitutional petitions, now also will be able to turn away petitions that are unlikely to provide adequate funding for their proposed laws. A new Missouri law gives greater power to the secretary of state, instead of judges, to rewrite ballot summaries struck down as being insufficient or unfair. Most states require only a majority vote to amend their constitutions, though Colorado requires 55% approval and Florida 60%. Republican-led legislatures in North Dakota and South Dakota approved measures this year proposing a 60% public vote to approve future constitutional amendments, and Utah lawmakers backed a 60% threshold for tax measures. All three propositions still must go before voters, where they will need only a majority to pass. Voters rejected similar proposals in Ohio, Arkansas and South Dakota in recent years, but they approved a 60% threshold for tax measures in Arizona. Lawmakers contend the move has merit. \\u201cRaising the threshold can help protect the constitution from being manipulated by special interest groups or out-of-state activists,\\u201d North Dakota House Majority Leader Mike Lefor said earlier this year. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Dura and Kate Payne contributed to this report. ___ Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

By Meg Kinnard April 14, 2025 08:06:43 AM We take a look at the Trump administration\\u2019s economic messaging after another week of reeling markets that saw the president reverse course on some of his steepest tariffs.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Trump team tries to project confidence and calm after tariff moves While his team was out defending his proposals on Sunday, Trump said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, whose production is concentrated in China. Rather, Trump said, \\u201cthose products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \\u2018bucket.\\u2019\\u201d A week ago, Trump\\u2019s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10% universal tariff for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. Last week on CBS\\u2019 \\u201cFace the Nation,\\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick played up national security. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to realize this is a national security issue,\\u201d he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the U.S. were involved in a war. On Sunday, Lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. \\u201cThe world cheats us. They\\u2019ve been cheating us for decades,\\u201d Navarro said on NBC\\u2019s \\u201cMeet the Press.\\u201d He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to U.S. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. Read more. Of note: With the higher rates set to be collected beginning April 9, administration officials argued last week that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. On Sunday, Navarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials. Greer said on CBS that his goal was \\u201cto get meaningful deals before 90 days\\u201d \\u2013 the duration of Trump\\u2019s pause \\u2013 \\u201cand I think we\\u2019re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.\\u201d Related reads \\u27a4 Thune's 'old fashioned' approach to Senate has kept Trump on board so far The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace. It wasn\\u2019t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \\u201cRazin\\u201d Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and \\u2014 importantly for Thune \\u2014 the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years. At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune said his message in conversations with the president was, \\u201cLet us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we\\u2019ll see where we go from there.\\u201d Read more. Of note: That approach has been successful so far, allowing the South Dakota Republican to show Trump the Senate\\u2019s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president\\u2019s Cabinet. Related reads \\u27a4 What might El Salvador\\u2019s Bukele get by visiting Trump? Trump is hosting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a lynchpin of the U.S. administration's mass deportation operation. Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. More than 200 Venezuelan immigrants \\u2013 whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes \\u2014 and placed them inside the country's notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It is also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so. That has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country\\u2019s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported. Read more. Of note: Since Secretary of State Marco Rubio\\u2019s visit in February, Bukele \\u2014 whose government has arrested more than 84,000 people as part of his three-year crackdown on gangs \\u2014 has made it clear he\\u2019s ready to help the Trump administration with its deportation ambitions. Bukele struck a deal under which the U.S. will pay about $6 million for El Salvador to imprison the Venezuelan immigrants for a year. When a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn around a flight carrying the immigrants already en route to El Salvador, Bukele wrote on social media: \\u201cOopsie ... too late.\\\" Related reads \\u27a4 IN PHOTOS President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's son X \\u00c6 A-Xii watch a mixed martial arts fight at UFC 314, Saturday, in Miami.

But his case isn\\u2019t the only one of its kind inching through the U.S. court system. Nearly two months have passed since a 20-year-old Venezuelan native, known only as Cristian in court filings, was deported to El Salvador despite having a pending asylum application. Now his lawyers want to know if there are others like him. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher stopped short of ordering the Trump administration to produce a list of any others who are in the same legal situation as Cristian. But the judge made it clear during a hearing Tuesday that she won\\u2019t second-guess her earlier order for the Trump administration to facilitate Cristian\\u2019s return to the U.S. Gallagher, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, said it is a \\u201cfair inference\\u201d that the administration has done nothing to comply with her April 23 decision. She gave the government until Thursday to appeal her ruling before she considers ordering specific steps to comply with the order. Gallagher said the case isn\\u2019t about whether Cristian is entitled to asylum if he is able to return to the U.S. \\u201cThe issue is and always has been one of process,\\u201d the judge said. \\u201cPeople are entitled to that.\\u201d Abrego Garcia and Cristian both were deported on March 15. Dozens of other people were flown from the U.S. to El Salvador after Trump issued a proclamation calling for the arrest and removal of Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law. Cristian had been transferred into federal custody from a jail in Harris County, Texas, in January. Abrego Garcia was arrested in Maryland, where he lived with his wife \\u2014 a U.S. citizen \\u2014 and their children. Unlike Cristian, Abrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador. A U.S. immigration judge\\u2019s order in 2019 protected him from being sent there because he likely faced persecution by local Salvadoran gangs that terrorized him and his family. Gallagher ruled that the government violated a 2019 settlement agreement when it deported Cristian. She said she was guided by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis\\u2019 ruling that Trump\\u2019s Republican administration must facilitate Abrego Garcia\\u2019s return. \\u201cStanding by and taking no action is not facilitation,\\u201d Gallagher wrote. \\u201cIn prior cases involving wrongfully removed individuals, courts have ordered, and the government has taken, affirmative steps toward facilitating return.\\u201d Gallagher said her order requires the government to make \\u201ca good faith request\\u201d for the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody. Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia\\u2019s return. The judge set May deadlines this month for administration officials to testify under oath about what they have done to comply. Abrego Garcia\\u2019s attorneys said the administration was moving toward bringing him back when it asked for a pause in the court case last month. \\u201cWe agreed to that request because we understood it to be made in good faith,\\u201d the lawyers said in a news release. \\u201cUnfortunately, one week later, it remains unclear what, if anything, the government has done in the past seven days to bring our client home to his family.\\u201d The Justice Department is likely to appeal Gallagher\\u2019s rulings in Cristian\\u2019s favor. Any appeal would be heard by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime, Gallagher refused Tuesday to suspend her April 23 decision. The judge scheduled Tuesday\\u2019s hearing to find out what, if anything, the government has done to comply with her order to facilitate Cristian\\u2019s return. Justice Department attorney Richard Ingebretsen merely told her that the State Department was notified of her ruling. \\u201cThat is the extent of the information,\\u201d Ingebretsen added. One of Cristian\\u2019s attorneys, Kevin DeJong, dismissed that response as a \\u201cnon-answer\\u201d and expressed concern that the administration is trying to avoid complying with the judge\\u2019s order. Ingebretsen said immigration officials have determined that Cristian isn\\u2019t entitled to asylum. But the man\\u2019s lawyers said he has a right to get a ruling on the merits of his asylum application by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Meanwhile, Cristian\\u2019s lawyers want to know if the U.S. has deported other people who are covered by the same settlement that benefited him. \\u201cThere may well be other class members removed and we don\\u2019t know about it,\\u201d DeJong said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not acceptable.\\u201d\",\n          \"Citizen activists supporting a public vote on important issues could have to brush up on their reading, writing and arithmetic if they want to get their initiatives on next year\\u2019s ballot in some states. A new Arkansas law will bar initiative ballot titles written above an eighth-grade reading level. And canvassers will have to verify that petition signers have either read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them. In South Dakota, sponsors will need to make sure their petition titles appears in 14-point type on the front page and 16-point font on the back, where people typically sign. And in Florida, volunteers will have to register with the state if they gather more than 25 petition signatures from outside their family or risk facing felony charges punishable by up to five years in prison. Across about dozen states, roughly 40 bills restricting or revamping the citizen initiative process have passed at least one legislative chamber this year, according to a review by The Associated Press. Many already have been signed into law. Some advocates for the initiative process are alarmed by the trend. \\u201cGlobally, as there\\u2019s movements to expand direct democracy. In the United States it\\u2019s contracting,\\u201d said Dane Waters, chair of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, who has advised ballot campaigns in over 20 nations. Most of the new restrictions come from Republican lawmakers in states where petitions have been used to place abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other progressive initiatives on the ballot. GOP lawmakers contend their measures are shielding state constitutions from outside interests. \\u201cThis is not a bill to restrict. It is a bill to protect \\u2014 to make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity, and that it\\u2019s free of fraud,\\u201d said state Sen. Jennifer Bradley of Florida, where the new initiative requirements already have been challenged in court. About half the U.S. states allow people to bypass their legislatures by gathering signatures to place proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot. Since Oregon voters first used the process in 1904, a total of 2,744 citizen initiatives have appeared on statewide ballots, with 42% wining approval, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute. But the process has long caused tension between voters and their elected representatives. Lawmakers often perceive the initiative process as \\u201can assault on their power and authority, and they want to limit it,\\u201d Waters said. \\u201cThey view it, in my opinion, as a nuisance \\u2013 a gnat that keeps bothering them.\\u201d Because initiative petitions require thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, groups sponsoring them often pay people to solicit signatures outside shopping centers and public places. Some states now prohibit payments based on the number of signatures gathered. States also are trying to restrict who can circulate petitions. A new Arkansas law requires paid petition canvassers to live in the state. And a new Montana law will make petition circulators wear badges displaying their name and home state. The new Florida law expanding registration requirements for petition circulators also requires them to undergo state training and bars canvassers who are noncitizens, nonresidents or felons without their voting rights restored. In addition to providing their name, address and birth date, people signing initiative petitions in Florida also will have to provide either their Florida driver\\u2019s license, state identification card or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That information is not required in other states, said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that has backed dozens of ballot initiatives in states. Hall said people concerned about privacy might hesitate to sign petitions. \\u201cI work in ballot measures, and I deeply support many of the things that folks have tried to put on the ballot in Florida, \\u201d Hall said, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t know if I could bring myself to do that \\u2013 that\\u2019s a very prohibitive requirement.\\u201d Many states already prescribe a particular format for initiative petitions. South Dakota\\u2019s new mandate for specific font sizes was prompted by allegations that some people got duped into signing a petition for abortion rights last year, said sponsoring state Sen. Amber Hulse, a Republican. Printing the ballot title in large type \\u201cmight make it harder for some issues to get on the ballot if people know what they\\u2019re signing. But that\\u2019s actually a good thing,\\u201d Hulse said. Before they can collect signatures, petition sponsors must get approval from state officials. New measures in several states give those officials greater authority. New Arkansas laws allow the attorney general to reject initiatives written above an eighth-grade reading level or which conflict with the U.S. Constitution or federal law. Utah\\u2019s lieutenant governor, who already can reject unconstitutional petitions, now also will be able to turn away petitions that are unlikely to provide adequate funding for their proposed laws. A new Missouri law gives greater power to the secretary of state, instead of judges, to rewrite ballot summaries struck down as being insufficient or unfair. Most states require only a majority vote to amend their constitutions, though Colorado requires 55% approval and Florida 60%. Republican-led legislatures in North Dakota and South Dakota approved measures this year proposing a 60% public vote to approve future constitutional amendments, and Utah lawmakers backed a 60% threshold for tax measures. All three propositions still must go before voters, where they will need only a majority to pass. Voters rejected similar proposals in Ohio, Arkansas and South Dakota in recent years, but they approved a 60% threshold for tax measures in Arizona. Lawmakers contend the move has merit. \\u201cRaising the threshold can help protect the constitution from being manipulated by special interest groups or out-of-state activists,\\u201d North Dakota House Majority Leader Mike Lefor said earlier this year. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Dura and Kate Payne contributed to this report. ___ Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

By Meg Kinnard April 14, 2025 08:06:43 AM We take a look at the Trump administration\\u2019s economic messaging after another week of reeling markets that saw the president reverse course on some of his steepest tariffs.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Trump team tries to project confidence and calm after tariff moves While his team was out defending his proposals on Sunday, Trump said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, whose production is concentrated in China. Rather, Trump said, \\u201cthose products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \\u2018bucket.\\u2019\\u201d A week ago, Trump\\u2019s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10% universal tariff for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. Last week on CBS\\u2019 \\u201cFace the Nation,\\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick played up national security. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to realize this is a national security issue,\\u201d he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the U.S. were involved in a war. On Sunday, Lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. \\u201cThe world cheats us. They\\u2019ve been cheating us for decades,\\u201d Navarro said on NBC\\u2019s \\u201cMeet the Press.\\u201d He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to U.S. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. Read more. Of note: With the higher rates set to be collected beginning April 9, administration officials argued last week that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. On Sunday, Navarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials. Greer said on CBS that his goal was \\u201cto get meaningful deals before 90 days\\u201d \\u2013 the duration of Trump\\u2019s pause \\u2013 \\u201cand I think we\\u2019re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.\\u201d Related reads \\u27a4 Thune's 'old fashioned' approach to Senate has kept Trump on board so far The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace. It wasn\\u2019t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \\u201cRazin\\u201d Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and \\u2014 importantly for Thune \\u2014 the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years. At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune said his message in conversations with the president was, \\u201cLet us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we\\u2019ll see where we go from there.\\u201d Read more. Of note: That approach has been successful so far, allowing the South Dakota Republican to show Trump the Senate\\u2019s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president\\u2019s Cabinet. Related reads \\u27a4 What might El Salvador\\u2019s Bukele get by visiting Trump? Trump is hosting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a lynchpin of the U.S. administration's mass deportation operation. Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. More than 200 Venezuelan immigrants \\u2013 whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes \\u2014 and placed them inside the country's notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It is also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so. That has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country\\u2019s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported. Read more. Of note: Since Secretary of State Marco Rubio\\u2019s visit in February, Bukele \\u2014 whose government has arrested more than 84,000 people as part of his three-year crackdown on gangs \\u2014 has made it clear he\\u2019s ready to help the Trump administration with its deportation ambitions. Bukele struck a deal under which the U.S. will pay about $6 million for El Salvador to imprison the Venezuelan immigrants for a year. When a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn around a flight carrying the immigrants already en route to El Salvador, Bukele wrote on social media: \\u201cOopsie ... too late.\\\" Related reads \\u27a4 IN PHOTOS President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's son X \\u00c6 A-Xii watch a mixed martial arts fight at UFC 314, Saturday, in Miami.

But his case isn\\u2019t the only one of its kind inching through the U.S. court system. Nearly two months have passed since a 20-year-old Venezuelan native, known only as Cristian in court filings, was deported to El Salvador despite having a pending asylum application. Now his lawyers want to know if there are others like him. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher stopped short of ordering the Trump administration to produce a list of any others who are in the same legal situation as Cristian. But the judge made it clear during a hearing Tuesday that she won\\u2019t second-guess her earlier order for the Trump administration to facilitate Cristian\\u2019s return to the U.S. Gallagher, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, said it is a \\u201cfair inference\\u201d that the administration has done nothing to comply with her April 23 decision. She gave the government until Thursday to appeal her ruling before she considers ordering specific steps to comply with the order. Gallagher said the case isn\\u2019t about whether Cristian is entitled to asylum if he is able to return to the U.S. \\u201cThe issue is and always has been one of process,\\u201d the judge said. \\u201cPeople are entitled to that.\\u201d Abrego Garcia and Cristian both were deported on March 15. Dozens of other people were flown from the U.S. to El Salvador after Trump issued a proclamation calling for the arrest and removal of Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law. Cristian had been transferred into federal custody from a jail in Harris County, Texas, in January. Abrego Garcia was arrested in Maryland, where he lived with his wife \\u2014 a U.S. citizen \\u2014 and their children. Unlike Cristian, Abrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador. A U.S. immigration judge\\u2019s order in 2019 protected him from being sent there because he likely faced persecution by local Salvadoran gangs that terrorized him and his family. Gallagher ruled that the government violated a 2019 settlement agreement when it deported Cristian. She said she was guided by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis\\u2019 ruling that Trump\\u2019s Republican administration must facilitate Abrego Garcia\\u2019s return. \\u201cStanding by and taking no action is not facilitation,\\u201d Gallagher wrote. \\u201cIn prior cases involving wrongfully removed individuals, courts have ordered, and the government has taken, affirmative steps toward facilitating return.\\u201d Gallagher said her order requires the government to make \\u201ca good faith request\\u201d for the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody. Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia\\u2019s return. The judge set May deadlines this month for administration officials to testify under oath about what they have done to comply. Abrego Garcia\\u2019s attorneys said the administration was moving toward bringing him back when it asked for a pause in the court case last month. \\u201cWe agreed to that request because we understood it to be made in good faith,\\u201d the lawyers said in a news release. \\u201cUnfortunately, one week later, it remains unclear what, if anything, the government has done in the past seven days to bring our client home to his family.\\u201d The Justice Department is likely to appeal Gallagher\\u2019s rulings in Cristian\\u2019s favor. Any appeal would be heard by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime, Gallagher refused Tuesday to suspend her April 23 decision. The judge scheduled Tuesday\\u2019s hearing to find out what, if anything, the government has done to comply with her order to facilitate Cristian\\u2019s return. Justice Department attorney Richard Ingebretsen merely told her that the State Department was notified of her ruling. \\u201cThat is the extent of the information,\\u201d Ingebretsen added. One of Cristian\\u2019s attorneys, Kevin DeJong, dismissed that response as a \\u201cnon-answer\\u201d and expressed concern that the administration is trying to avoid complying with the judge\\u2019s order. Ingebretsen said immigration officials have determined that Cristian isn\\u2019t entitled to asylum. But the man\\u2019s lawyers said he has a right to get a ruling on the merits of his asylum application by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Meanwhile, Cristian\\u2019s lawyers want to know if the U.S. has deported other people who are covered by the same settlement that benefited him. \\u201cThere may well be other class members removed and we don\\u2019t know about it,\\u201d DeJong said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not acceptable.\\u201d\",\n          \"Citizen activists supporting a public vote on important issues could have to brush up on their reading, writing and arithmetic if they want to get their initiatives on next year\\u2019s ballot in some states. A new Arkansas law will bar initiative ballot titles written above an eighth-grade reading level. And canvassers will have to verify that petition signers have either read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them. In South Dakota, sponsors will need to make sure their petition titles appears in 14-point type on the front page and 16-point font on the back, where people typically sign. And in Florida, volunteers will have to register with the state if they gather more than 25 petition signatures from outside their family or risk facing felony charges punishable by up to five years in prison. Across about dozen states, roughly 40 bills restricting or revamping the citizen initiative process have passed at least one legislative chamber this year, according to a review by The Associated Press. Many already have been signed into law. Some advocates for the initiative process are alarmed by the trend. \\u201cGlobally, as there\\u2019s movements to expand direct democracy. In the United States it\\u2019s contracting,\\u201d said Dane Waters, chair of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, who has advised ballot campaigns in over 20 nations. Most of the new restrictions come from Republican lawmakers in states where petitions have been used to place abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other progressive initiatives on the ballot. GOP lawmakers contend their measures are shielding state constitutions from outside interests. \\u201cThis is not a bill to restrict. It is a bill to protect \\u2014 to make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity, and that it\\u2019s free of fraud,\\u201d said state Sen. Jennifer Bradley of Florida, where the new initiative requirements already have been challenged in court. About half the U.S. states allow people to bypass their legislatures by gathering signatures to place proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot. Since Oregon voters first used the process in 1904, a total of 2,744 citizen initiatives have appeared on statewide ballots, with 42% wining approval, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute. But the process has long caused tension between voters and their elected representatives. Lawmakers often perceive the initiative process as \\u201can assault on their power and authority, and they want to limit it,\\u201d Waters said. \\u201cThey view it, in my opinion, as a nuisance \\u2013 a gnat that keeps bothering them.\\u201d Because initiative petitions require thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, groups sponsoring them often pay people to solicit signatures outside shopping centers and public places. Some states now prohibit payments based on the number of signatures gathered. States also are trying to restrict who can circulate petitions. A new Arkansas law requires paid petition canvassers to live in the state. And a new Montana law will make petition circulators wear badges displaying their name and home state. The new Florida law expanding registration requirements for petition circulators also requires them to undergo state training and bars canvassers who are noncitizens, nonresidents or felons without their voting rights restored. In addition to providing their name, address and birth date, people signing initiative petitions in Florida also will have to provide either their Florida driver\\u2019s license, state identification card or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That information is not required in other states, said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that has backed dozens of ballot initiatives in states. Hall said people concerned about privacy might hesitate to sign petitions. \\u201cI work in ballot measures, and I deeply support many of the things that folks have tried to put on the ballot in Florida, \\u201d Hall said, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t know if I could bring myself to do that \\u2013 that\\u2019s a very prohibitive requirement.\\u201d Many states already prescribe a particular format for initiative petitions. South Dakota\\u2019s new mandate for specific font sizes was prompted by allegations that some people got duped into signing a petition for abortion rights last year, said sponsoring state Sen. Amber Hulse, a Republican. Printing the ballot title in large type \\u201cmight make it harder for some issues to get on the ballot if people know what they\\u2019re signing. But that\\u2019s actually a good thing,\\u201d Hulse said. Before they can collect signatures, petition sponsors must get approval from state officials. New measures in several states give those officials greater authority. New Arkansas laws allow the attorney general to reject initiatives written above an eighth-grade reading level or which conflict with the U.S. Constitution or federal law. Utah\\u2019s lieutenant governor, who already can reject unconstitutional petitions, now also will be able to turn away petitions that are unlikely to provide adequate funding for their proposed laws. A new Missouri law gives greater power to the secretary of state, instead of judges, to rewrite ballot summaries struck down as being insufficient or unfair. Most states require only a majority vote to amend their constitutions, though Colorado requires 55% approval and Florida 60%. Republican-led legislatures in North Dakota and South Dakota approved measures this year proposing a 60% public vote to approve future constitutional amendments, and Utah lawmakers backed a 60% threshold for tax measures. All three propositions still must go before voters, where they will need only a majority to pass. Voters rejected similar proposals in Ohio, Arkansas and South Dakota in recent years, but they approved a 60% threshold for tax measures in Arizona. Lawmakers contend the move has merit. \\u201cRaising the threshold can help protect the constitution from being manipulated by special interest groups or out-of-state activists,\\u201d North Dakota House Majority Leader Mike Lefor said earlier this year. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Dura and Kate Payne contributed to this report. ___ Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

By Meg Kinnard April 14, 2025 08:06:43 AM We take a look at the Trump administration\\u2019s economic messaging after another week of reeling markets that saw the president reverse course on some of his steepest tariffs.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Trump team tries to project confidence and calm after tariff moves While his team was out defending his proposals on Sunday, Trump said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, whose production is concentrated in China. Rather, Trump said, \\u201cthose products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \\u2018bucket.\\u2019\\u201d A week ago, Trump\\u2019s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10% universal tariff for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. Last week on CBS\\u2019 \\u201cFace the Nation,\\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick played up national security. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to realize this is a national security issue,\\u201d he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the U.S. were involved in a war. On Sunday, Lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. \\u201cThe world cheats us. They\\u2019ve been cheating us for decades,\\u201d Navarro said on NBC\\u2019s \\u201cMeet the Press.\\u201d He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to U.S. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. Read more. Of note: With the higher rates set to be collected beginning April 9, administration officials argued last week that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. On Sunday, Navarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials. Greer said on CBS that his goal was \\u201cto get meaningful deals before 90 days\\u201d \\u2013 the duration of Trump\\u2019s pause \\u2013 \\u201cand I think we\\u2019re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.\\u201d Related reads \\u27a4 Thune's 'old fashioned' approach to Senate has kept Trump on board so far The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace. It wasn\\u2019t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \\u201cRazin\\u201d Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and \\u2014 importantly for Thune \\u2014 the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years. At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune said his message in conversations with the president was, \\u201cLet us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we\\u2019ll see where we go from there.\\u201d Read more. Of note: That approach has been successful so far, allowing the South Dakota Republican to show Trump the Senate\\u2019s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president\\u2019s Cabinet. Related reads \\u27a4 What might El Salvador\\u2019s Bukele get by visiting Trump? Trump is hosting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a lynchpin of the U.S. administration's mass deportation operation. Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. More than 200 Venezuelan immigrants \\u2013 whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes \\u2014 and placed them inside the country's notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It is also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so. That has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country\\u2019s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported. Read more. Of note: Since Secretary of State Marco Rubio\\u2019s visit in February, Bukele \\u2014 whose government has arrested more than 84,000 people as part of his three-year crackdown on gangs \\u2014 has made it clear he\\u2019s ready to help the Trump administration with its deportation ambitions. Bukele struck a deal under which the U.S. will pay about $6 million for El Salvador to imprison the Venezuelan immigrants for a year. When a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn around a flight carrying the immigrants already en route to El Salvador, Bukele wrote on social media: \\u201cOopsie ... too late.\\\" Related reads \\u27a4 IN PHOTOS President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's son X \\u00c6 A-Xii watch a mixed martial arts fight at UFC 314, Saturday, in Miami.

A new Arkansas law will bar initiative ballot titles written above an eighth-grade reading level. And canvassers will have to verify that petition signers have either read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them. In South Dakota, sponsors will need to make sure their petition titles appears in 14-point type on the front page and 16-point font on the back, where people typically sign. And in Florida, volunteers will have to register with the state if they gather more than 25 petition signatures from outside their family or risk facing felony charges punishable by up to five years in prison. Across about dozen states, roughly 40 bills restricting or revamping the citizen initiative process have passed at least one legislative chamber this year, according to a review by The Associated Press. Many already have been signed into law. Some advocates for the initiative process are alarmed by the trend. \\u201cGlobally, as there\\u2019s movements to expand direct democracy. In the United States it\\u2019s contracting,\\u201d said Dane Waters, chair of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, who has advised ballot campaigns in over 20 nations. Most of the new restrictions come from Republican lawmakers in states where petitions have been used to place abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other progressive initiatives on the ballot. GOP lawmakers contend their measures are shielding state constitutions from outside interests. \\u201cThis is not a bill to restrict. It is a bill to protect \\u2014 to make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity, and that it\\u2019s free of fraud,\\u201d said state Sen. Jennifer Bradley of Florida, where the new initiative requirements already have been challenged in court. About half the U.S. states allow people to bypass their legislatures by gathering signatures to place proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot. Since Oregon voters first used the process in 1904, a total of 2,744 citizen initiatives have appeared on statewide ballots, with 42% wining approval, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute. But the process has long caused tension between voters and their elected representatives. Lawmakers often perceive the initiative process as \\u201can assault on their power and authority, and they want to limit it,\\u201d Waters said. \\u201cThey view it, in my opinion, as a nuisance \\u2013 a gnat that keeps bothering them.\\u201d Because initiative petitions require thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, groups sponsoring them often pay people to solicit signatures outside shopping centers and public places. Some states now prohibit payments based on the number of signatures gathered. States also are trying to restrict who can circulate petitions. A new Arkansas law requires paid petition canvassers to live in the state. And a new Montana law will make petition circulators wear badges displaying their name and home state. The new Florida law expanding registration requirements for petition circulators also requires them to undergo state training and bars canvassers who are noncitizens, nonresidents or felons without their voting rights restored. In addition to providing their name, address and birth date, people signing initiative petitions in Florida also will have to provide either their Florida driver\\u2019s license, state identification card or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That information is not required in other states, said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that has backed dozens of ballot initiatives in states. Hall said people concerned about privacy might hesitate to sign petitions. \\u201cI work in ballot measures, and I deeply support many of the things that folks have tried to put on the ballot in Florida, \\u201d Hall said, \\u201cand I don\\u2019t know if I could bring myself to do that \\u2013 that\\u2019s a very prohibitive requirement.\\u201d Many states already prescribe a particular format for initiative petitions. South Dakota\\u2019s new mandate for specific font sizes was prompted by allegations that some people got duped into signing a petition for abortion rights last year, said sponsoring state Sen. Amber Hulse, a Republican. Printing the ballot title in large type \\u201cmight make it harder for some issues to get on the ballot if people know what they\\u2019re signing. But that\\u2019s actually a good thing,\\u201d Hulse said. Before they can collect signatures, petition sponsors must get approval from state officials. New measures in several states give those officials greater authority. New Arkansas laws allow the attorney general to reject initiatives written above an eighth-grade reading level or which conflict with the U.S. Constitution or federal law. Utah\\u2019s lieutenant governor, who already can reject unconstitutional petitions, now also will be able to turn away petitions that are unlikely to provide adequate funding for their proposed laws. A new Missouri law gives greater power to the secretary of state, instead of judges, to rewrite ballot summaries struck down as being insufficient or unfair. Most states require only a majority vote to amend their constitutions, though Colorado requires 55% approval and Florida 60%. Republican-led legislatures in North Dakota and South Dakota approved measures this year proposing a 60% public vote to approve future constitutional amendments, and Utah lawmakers backed a 60% threshold for tax measures. All three propositions still must go before voters, where they will need only a majority to pass. Voters rejected similar proposals in Ohio, Arkansas and South Dakota in recent years, but they approved a 60% threshold for tax measures in Arizona. Lawmakers contend the move has merit. \\u201cRaising the threshold can help protect the constitution from being manipulated by special interest groups or out-of-state activists,\\u201d North Dakota House Majority Leader Mike Lefor said earlier this year. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Dura and Kate Payne contributed to this report. ___ Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The court acted in the dispute over a policy that presumptively disqualifies transgender people from military service and could lead to the expulsion of experienced, decorated officers. The court\\u2019s three liberal justices said they would have kept the policy on hold. Neither the justices in the majority or dissent explained their votes, which is not uncommon in emergency appeals. Just after beginning his second term in January, Trump moved aggressively to roll back the rights of transgender people. Among the Republican president\\u2019s actions was an executive order that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members \\u201cconflicts with a soldier\\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\\u2019s personal life\\u201d and is harmful to military readiness. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the Supreme Court has acted to allow a transgender military service ban, for the time being. In response, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy in February that gave the military services 30 days to figure out how they would seek out and identify transgender service members to remove them from the force. Those actions had been stalled by the lawsuits. \\u201cNo More Trans @ DoD,\\u201d Hegseth wrote in a post on X following Tuesday\\u2019s Supreme Court order. Earlier in the day, before the court acted, Hegseth said that his department is leaving wokeness and weakness behind. \\u201cNo more pronouns,\\u201d he told a special operations forces conference in Tampa. \\u201cNo more dudes in dresses. We\\u2019re done with that s\\u2014-.\\u201d The Defense Department said Tuesday that officials are currently determining the next steps, but officials were not aware of any actions being taken right away. Three federal judges had ruled against the ban. In the case the justices acted on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Benjamin Settle in Tacoma, Washington, had ruled for seven long-serving transgender military members who say that the ban is insulting and discriminatory and that their firing would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations. A prospective service member also sued. The individual service members who challenged the ban together have amassed more than 70 medals in 115 years of service, their lawyers wrote. The lead plaintiff is Emily Shilling, a Navy commander with nearly 20 years of service, including as a combat pilot who flew 60 missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The Trump administration offered no explanation as to why transgender troops, who have been able to serve openly over the past four years with no evidence of problems, should suddenly be banned, Settle wrote. The judge is an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and is a former captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps. Settle imposed a nationwide hold on the policy and a federal appeals court rejected the administration\\u2019s emergency plea. The Justice Department then turned to the Supreme Court. The policy also has been blocked by a federal judge in the nation\\u2019s capital, but that ruling has been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court, which heard arguments last month. The three-judge panel, which includes two judges appointed by Trump during his first term, appeared to be in favor of the administration\\u2019s position. In a more limited ruling, a judge in New Jersey also has barred the Air Force from removing two transgender men, saying they showed their separation would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations that no monetary settlement could repair. The LGBTQ rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation called the high court order a devastating blow to dedicated and highly qualified service members. \\u201cBy allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice. Transgender individuals meet the same standards and demonstrate the same values as all who serve. We remain steadfast in our belief that this ban violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and will ultimately be struck down,\\u201d the groups said in a statement. The federal appeals court in San Francisco will hear the administration\\u2019s appeal in a process that will play out over several months at least. All the while, though, the transgender ban will remain in place under the Supreme Court order. In 2016, during Barack Obama\\u2019s presidency, a Defense Department policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. During Trump\\u2019s first term in the White House, the Republican issued a directive to ban transgender service members, with an exception for some of those who had already started transitioning under more lenient rules that were in effect during Obama\\u2019s Democratic administration. The Supreme Court allowed that ban to take effect. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped it when he took office. The rules the Defense Department wants to enforce contain no exceptions. The policy during Trump\\u2019s first term and the new one are \\u201cmaterially indistinguishable,\\u201d Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the justices, though lawyers for the service members who sued disagreed. Thousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the 2.1 million troops serving. A senior defense official said in February that they believe there are about 4,200 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria currently serving in the active duty, National Guard and Reserves. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues, said that between 2015 and 2024, the total cost for psychotherapy, gender-affirming hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgery and other treatment for service members is about $52 million. ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Curry will have an MRI on Wednesday. His status is day to day, but coach Steve Kerr acknowledged it\\u2019s unlikely he\\u2019ll be available to play in Game 2 on Thursday. \\u201cHe\\u2019s obviously crushed, but the guys picked him up and played a great game,\\u201d Kerr said. \\u201cObviously we\\u2019re all concerned about Steph, but that\\u2019s part of the game. Guys get hurt, and you move on. Our guys did a great job of moving on and getting a great win 48 hours after a Game 7 road win. It\\u2019s an amazing group of guys. They compete. They\\u2019re together.\\u201d Curry started grabbing at the back of his left leg early in the second quarter shortly after hitting a 26-foot step-back 3-pointer. He powered through some discomfort for a bit, and after getting a 14-foot floater to fall for a 27-20 lead he started motioning to the bench that he needed to come out. Once a timeout by the Timberwolves finally stopped the clock, Curry jogged gingerly to the locker room with 13 points in 13 minutes on 5-for-9 shooting. \\u201cA little deflating, but we knew he did a great job of helping us build a comfortable lead,\\u201d teammate Draymond Green said. The 37-year-old Curry helped Golden State beat Houston in Game 7 of their first-round series two nights earlier. Going the distance after taking a 3-1 lead in that series cost Curry and the Warriors some valuable rest time, and there\\u2019s only one day off between games for the first five games. There are three off days between Game 5 on May 14 and Game 6 on May 18. After a five-year period during which he had a hard time staying healthy, with a variety of injuries to both hands and feet, Curry played in 70 games this season after logging 74 games last season. The four-time NBA champion and 11-time All-Star averaged 24 points per game against the Rockets for the sixth-seeded Warriors. The spirits were high for the Warriors in the aftermath of their all-hands-on-deck dismantling of the Wolves, despite the ominous departure of their most important player. \\u201cWe have the best coaching staff in the NBA. We know they\\u2019ll put us in a good spot,\\u201d said Jimmy Butler, who finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. \\u201cWe all want \\u201830\\u2019 back. Until then, we can all hold down the fort.\\u201d ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\",\n          \"PHOENIX (AP) \\u2014 Zac Gallen pitched seven strong innings, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit a two-run homer and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the New York Mets 5-1 on Tuesday night. Gallen (3-4) had his longest outing of the season, giving up one run on two hits and three walks while striking out six. The right-hander coaxed a double-play grounder from Jeff McNeil in the seventh to end his evening. It was the second time in a week that Gallen frustrated the Mets\\u2019 powerful lineup. He gave up just one run over six innings last Thursday in New York during Arizona\\u2019s 4-2 win. Gurriel gave the D-backs a 4-1 lead in the sixth by jumping on a first-pitch fastball that David Peterson left over the plate. The two-run shot scored Josh Naylor, who reached on a leadoff walk. Naylor had a sacrifice fly in the seventh that pushed Arizona ahead 5-1. He finished with two runs scored and two RBIs. Gurriel had three hits, including a double. The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the third when Pete Alonso walked with the bases loaded, forcing in Tyrone Taylor. Francisco Alvarez had two of the team\\u2019s four hits. Alonso struck out three times. Peterson (2-2) gave up four runs on five hits and four walks over six innings, striking out six. The Mets had runners on first and third with one out in the ninth, but new D-backs closer Shelby Miller retired Brandon Nimmo on a liner and Mark Vientos on a shallow fly to end the game. Gallen threw 101 pitches and Peterson threw 104. It was just the third time in the majors this season that both starters reached 100 pitches. RHP Kodai Senga (3-2, 1.38 ERA) takes the mound for the Mets against RHP Merrill Kelly (3-1, 4.06) and the Diamondbacks on Wednesday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\",\n          \"CHICAGO (AP) \\u2014 It happened again. Justin Verlander was in position for his first win with the San Francisco Giants \\u2014 but he walked away empty-handed. Verlander pitched five innings Tuesday night against the Chicago Cubs before giving a 5-3 lead to San Francisco\\u2019s bullpen. The three-time AL Cy Young Award winner ended up with another no-decision, but the Giants scored nine times in the 11th for a 14-5 victory. \\u201cIt\\u2019s crazy, because he could easily have four or five wins at this point,\\u201d San Francisco manager Bob Melvin said. \\u201cSo just another one of those where we\\u2019re a pitch away from getting him a win, and next thing you know he doesn\\u2019t, but it doesn\\u2019t mean he\\u2019s not performing well.\\u201d The 42-year-old Verlander signed a $15 million, one-year contract with the Giants in January. He was charged with two losses while going winless in his first eight starts for the longest such drought at any point during his 20 seasons in the majors. \\u201cI\\u2019m somebody who really tries to focus on the big picture,\\u201d Verlander said. \\u201cJust try to keep pitching well and giving us a chance to win and that\\u2019s doing my job, and wins can come in bunches. It\\u2019s a team sport. Not everything is in your control as a starter, and I know that.\\u201d Verlander allowed five hits, struck out three and walked two against the NL Central leaders. The big blow was Miguel Amaya\\u2019s two-run homer after San Francisco had opened a 4-0 lead in the top of the third. \\u201cObviously, you want some wins,\\u201d Verlander said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve also been somebody who never really expects a lot of wins when I only go five innings. I don\\u2019t really feel like I did my job as well as I should have today.\\u201d During his season-opening drought, Verlander has been hurt by lackluster run support. He had a 1.96 ERA in 18 1/3 innings over his previous three starts. He was in position to get his first win against Colorado on Thursday, but the lowly Rockies rallied for a 4-3 win. Verlander went 5-6 with a 5.48 ERA in 17 starts for Houston last year. He had stints on the injured list for shoulder inflammation and neck discomfort. The nine-time All-Star became a free agent after he failed to pitch 140 innings, a total that would have triggered his ability to exercise a $35 million conditional player option. Verlander is 262-149 with a 3.31 ERA in 534 career starts. He is tops among active big league pitchers in wins, innings (3,457 2/3), strikeouts (3,451) and starts (534). \\u201cI\\u2019ve been kind of working my way towards I think being better and better,\\u201d Verlander said. \\u201cJust kind of stay the course and see what happens.

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. Mr Bessent said he looked forward to rebalancing the international economic system to better serve the interests of the US. \\\"My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,\\\" he said in an interview with Fox News. \\\"If the United States wants to resolve the issue through negotiations, it must face up to the serious negative impact of unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world,\\\" a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday morning. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. The report added that China is open to talks but reiterated that if the country decides to continue to fight this trade war \\u2013 it will fight to the end. The trade war has triggered turmoil in financial markets and sent shockwaves across global trade. Two trade experts told the BBC that they were not particularly optimistic about the talks, at least in the initial phase. \\\"You have to start somewhere, so I'm not saying it isn't worthwhile. Just unlikely to be the launch event people are hoping to see,\\\" said Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation. \\\"We should expect to see a lot of back and forth, just like what happened last time in 2018,\\\" Henry Gao, Professor of Law at Singapore Management University and a former Chinese lawyer on the World Trade Organization secretariat said. \\\"I would expect the talks to drag on for several months or even more than a year\\\". Financial markets in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news as well as announcements by Chinese authorities of measures to support the economy. US stock futures were also higher. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date and are an indication of how markets will trade when they open. Investors are also waiting for the US central bank to make its latest announcement on interest rates on Wednesday afternoon.

The British government said the \\\"landmark\\\" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and \\\"deliver for British people and business\\\". Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled \\u00a342.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional \\u00a325.5bn a year by 2040. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was \\\"ambitious and mutually beneficial\\\". The pact would help \\\"catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies\\\", he said in a post on social media platform X. Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said. That includes lower tariffs on: The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: The British government said the deal was the \\\"biggest and most economically significant\\\" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were \\\"massive\\\". Tariffs on gin and whisky, a key sticking point in negotiations previously, will be halved to 75%, with further reductions taking effect in later years. Tariffs of 100% on more expensive UK-made cars exported to India will fall to 10%, subject to a quota limiting the total number. The deal also includes provisions on the services sector and procurement allowing British firms to compete for more contracts. Under the terms of the deal, some Indian and British workers will also gain from a three-year exemption from social security payments, which the Indian government called \\\"an unprecedented achievement\\\". The exemption applies to the staff of Indian companies temporarily transferred to the UK, and to UK firms' workers transferred to India. Social security contributions will be paid by employers and employees in their home country only, rather than in both places. The UK already has similar reciprocal \\\"double contribution convention\\\" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea, the government said. However, leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch described the agreement as \\\"two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir\\\", with Labour's increase in employer NI contributions from the Budget coming into force last month. Shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith said: \\\"Every time Labour negotiates, Britain loses\\\". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it was \\\"very worrying to hear concerns that Indian workers coming over here, companies may not have to pay taxes on those workers\\\" and called for MPs to be allowed to vote on the deal. The government said the National Insurance exemption would not affect NHS funding, since Indians working in the UK would still be required to pay the immigration health surcharge. India, currently the fifth largest economy in the world, is forecast to become the third-largest within a few years, making it a desirable trading partner for the UK, currently the world's sixth largest economy. The UK is also a high priority trading partner for Prime Minister Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to increase exports by $1 trillion by 2030. The deal is a win for free trade at a time when US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff campaign has put the idea on the defensive and raised fears of tit-for-tat trade wars. It appears to have increased the impetus to strike this trade deal. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of business lobby group, the CBI, welcomed the deal saying it provided a \\\"beacon of hope amidst the spectre of protectionism\\\" following Trump's wave of tariffs. UK businesses saw \\\"myriad\\\" opportunities in the Indian market, she added. Allie Renison, from communications firm SEC Newgate, and a former government trade adviser, said the deal was potentially \\\"transformational\\\" due to India's size, growth rate and relatively high existing barriers to accessing its market.\",\n          \"Barbie maker Mattel says it will put up the prices of some of its toys in the US as President Donald Trump's tariffs increase its costs. The firm also says it will cut the number of products it makes in China for the American market. At the same time, car making giant Ford says the levies will cost it about $1.5bn (\\u00a31.13bn) this year. They join a growing list of big businesses warning about the impact of US tariffs on their companies and the wider economy. \\\"Given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving US tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending, and Mattel's US sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season,\\\" Mattel said as it updated investors on its financial performance. The US accounts for about half of Mattel's global toy sales. It imports around 20% of its goods sold there from China. The company said it plans to reduce those Chinese imports to the US to below 15% by next year. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed new import taxes of up to 145% on goods from China. His administration said last month that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US. Apart from China, Mattel imports products \\u2013 including Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars \\u2013 from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The three countries were also hit with steep tariffs by Trump in April, before they were paused for 90 days. Last week, Trump acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs. American children might \\\"have two dolls instead of 30 dolls\\\", he said, but added that China would suffer more than the US. Carmaker Ford said it expected tariffs to add $2.5bn to its overall costs this year, mainly due to the increased expense of Mexican and Chinese imports. But the firm said it had cut about $1bn of those added costs by taking various measures, including transporting vehicles from Mexico to Canada to avoid US tariffs. The firm also suspended its annual earnings guidance to investors because of uncertainty around Trump's trade policies. In April, firms including technology giant Intel, footwear makers Adidas and Skechers, and consumer goods group Procter & Gamble detailed the impact of tariffs on their businesses. \\\"The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing,\\\" Intel's chief financial officer David Zinsner said during a call with investors. Sportswear giant Adidas warned tariffs would lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers, including the Gazelle and the Samba. The finance chief of footwear firm Skechers, David Weinberg, told investors: \\\"The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success.\\\" And Procter & Gamble \\u2013 which makes Ariel laundry detergent, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Gillette shaving products \\u2013 said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape \\u2013 from what was the US's most secure prison \\u2013 continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime. In May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made \\\"the most feared journey in the criminal world\\\" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed \\\"the Rock\\\", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped. Alcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \\\"Machine Gun\\\" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the \\\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\\". \\\"Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,\\\" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it. Four years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night. When the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. \\\"A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,\\\" he said. \\\"Built over the rambling passages of an old fort\\u2026 the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up.\\\" With Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood. But while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place.

Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it \\u2013 carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower \\u2013 shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered. The island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. \\\"When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,\\\" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. \\\"I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was.\\\" The prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again. Although the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964.\\\" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,\\\" he said. \\\"Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?\\\" Alcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: \\\"the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners\\\". Over the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves \\u2013 unable to face the unrelenting conditions \\u2013 and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment. As for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service. But speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them. In 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read \\\"I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!\\\" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not. The case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.

Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history. The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), \\\"arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed\\\". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities \\u2013 in a context where the very concept of \\\"blackness\\\" was created by non-black oppressors. Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme \\\"Tailored for you\\\" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James. The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The \\\"superfine\\\" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to \\\"a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'\\\" \\u2013 a reminder that how you dress can contain \\\"a lot of emotion\\\". Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. \\\"Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,\\\" Miller tells the BBC. \\\"It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised.\\\" Dandyism was already laying its foundations. In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters \\u2013 in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman. However, in the case of Julius Soubise \\u2013 manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury \\u2013 the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be. While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing \\u2013 once again \\u2013 boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman \\u2013 complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles \\u2013 in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with \\\"a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]\\\" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his \\\"master\\\" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England. Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of. In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them. The suit, explains Miller, is \\\"a historical throughline\\\" in the exhibition, which includes everything \\\"from livery garments\\u2026 to tailcoats and different versions of it\\u2026 to even track suiting\\\". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom.

This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched \\\"Hammer pants\\\". Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as \\\"a dandy among dandies\\\", Andr\\u00e9 Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. \\\"He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,\\\" writes Wintour. \\\"For Andr\\u00e9, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once.\\\" For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Ik\\u00e9 Ud\\u00e9, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. \\\"Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,\\\" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Ud\\u00e9, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. \\\"He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,\\\" explains Miller. \\\"It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit.\\\" This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline \\\"designed by an immigrant\\\". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. \\\"He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,\\\" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, \\\"that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that\\\". Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. \\\"Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture.\\\" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. \\\"It's very much related to a jazz riff,\\\" Miller adds. \\\"Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new\\u2026\\\" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025. The accompanying book by Monica L Miller is published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and distributed by Yale University Press. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

It comes as filming begins for the 15th series of the BBC One drama, which follows a group of nurse midwives working in London's East End from the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will \\\"delve into the deeper past\\\", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The new, separate film and prequel projects will be written, created and produced by Thomas and executive producers Dame Pippa Harris and Ann Tricklebank, who will also oversee the production of series 16 of the programme together. The prequel series will feature \\\"some familiar (if much younger) faces\\\", Thomas said. She said that while she has \\\"never run out of stories for our midwives\\\", she had found herself \\\"yearning to delve into the deeper past\\\" than the years 1957 to 1971 which have been covered by the show. \\\"The Blitz years in the East End were extraordinary - filled with loss, togetherness, courage and joy,\\\" she said. Meanwhile, the film will see the \\\"much-loved\\\" regular characters \\\"take a short break from Poplar and test themselves in an unfamiliar landscape\\\", Ms Thomas said. The location of the film remains \\\"top secret\\\", she added - but said it would look \\\"absolutely fantastic\\\" on the big screen. The first series of the show was originally inspired by the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, who worked as a midwife and nurse in the community in Poplar. Dame Pippa said the prequel series and film project were being made partly for a \\\"new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face.\\\" The 15th series will begin with a two-part Christmas special which will see characters travelling to Hong Kong on a mercy mission.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape \\u2013 from what was the US's most secure prison \\u2013 continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime. In May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made \\\"the most feared journey in the criminal world\\\" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed \\\"the Rock\\\", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped. Alcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \\\"Machine Gun\\\" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the \\\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\\". \\\"Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,\\\" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it. Four years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night. When the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. \\\"A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,\\\" he said. \\\"Built over the rambling passages of an old fort\\u2026 the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up.\\\" With Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood. But while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place.

Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it \\u2013 carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower \\u2013 shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered. The island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. \\\"When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,\\\" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. \\\"I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was.\\\" The prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again. Although the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964.\\\" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,\\\" he said. \\\"Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?\\\" Alcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: \\\"the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners\\\". Over the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves \\u2013 unable to face the unrelenting conditions \\u2013 and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment. As for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service. But speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them. In 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read \\\"I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!\\\" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not. The case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.

Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history. The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), \\\"arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed\\\". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities \\u2013 in a context where the very concept of \\\"blackness\\\" was created by non-black oppressors. Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme \\\"Tailored for you\\\" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James. The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The \\\"superfine\\\" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to \\\"a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'\\\" \\u2013 a reminder that how you dress can contain \\\"a lot of emotion\\\". Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. \\\"Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,\\\" Miller tells the BBC. \\\"It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised.\\\" Dandyism was already laying its foundations. In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters \\u2013 in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman. However, in the case of Julius Soubise \\u2013 manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury \\u2013 the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be. While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing \\u2013 once again \\u2013 boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman \\u2013 complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles \\u2013 in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with \\\"a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]\\\" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his \\\"master\\\" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England. Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of. In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them. The suit, explains Miller, is \\\"a historical throughline\\\" in the exhibition, which includes everything \\\"from livery garments\\u2026 to tailcoats and different versions of it\\u2026 to even track suiting\\\". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom. More like this: \\u2022 Seven of the best Met Gala looks over the decades \\u2022 Coachella looks from Lady Gaga to Sabrina Carpenter \\u2022The indigenous American supermodel bringing change When rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched \\\"Hammer pants\\\". Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as \\\"a dandy among dandies\\\", Andr\\u00e9 Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. \\\"He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,\\\" writes Wintour. \\\"For Andr\\u00e9, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once.\\\" For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Ik\\u00e9 Ud\\u00e9, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. \\\"Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,\\\" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Ud\\u00e9, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. \\\"He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,\\\" explains Miller. \\\"It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit.\\\" This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline \\\"designed by an immigrant\\\". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. \\\"He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,\\\" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, \\\"that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that\\\". Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. \\\"Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture.\\\" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. \\\"It's very much related to a jazz riff,\\\" Miller adds. \\\"Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new\\u2026\\\" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025.

It comes as filming begins for the 15th series of the BBC One drama, which follows a group of nurse midwives working in London's East End from the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will \\\"delve into the deeper past\\\", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The new, separate film and prequel projects will be written, created and produced by Thomas and executive producers Dame Pippa Harris and Ann Tricklebank, who will also oversee the production of series 16 of the programme together. The prequel series will feature \\\"some familiar (if much younger) faces\\\", Thomas said. She said that while she has \\\"never run out of stories for our midwives\\\", she had found herself \\\"yearning to delve into the deeper past\\\" than the years 1957 to 1971 which have been covered by the show. \\\"The Blitz years in the East End were extraordinary - filled with loss, togetherness, courage and joy,\\\" she said. Meanwhile, the film will see the \\\"much-loved\\\" regular characters \\\"take a short break from Poplar and test themselves in an unfamiliar landscape\\\", Ms Thomas said. The location of the film remains \\\"top secret\\\", she added - but said it would look \\\"absolutely fantastic\\\" on the big screen. The first series of the show was originally inspired by the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, who worked as a midwife and nurse in the community in Poplar. Dame Pippa said the prequel series and film project were being made partly for a \\\"new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face.\\\" The 15th series will begin with a two-part Christmas special which will see characters travelling to Hong Kong on a mercy mission.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Chris from Tilbury If you are English, I think the Liverpool-Barcelona semi-final is still the one to beat. But for the neutral fan, last night's game was absolutely bonkers and absolutely brilliant. Mark the \\\"elite\\\" fan, from Hastings Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of added time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie, the 37-year-old charging around with his shirt off in wild celebrations. And there were more ecstatic scenes when substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra-time before climbing up a security fence to celebrate in front of Inter's fans. It means a second Champions League final in three seasons for three-time European champions Inter after two legs of incredible drama which saw 13 goals and a tie turned on its head on several occasions. Inter, who lost 1-0 to Manchester City in the 2023 final, will play either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday, 31 May in the 2025 showpiece. OK, let's walk back through last night's game now together. For those who missed it, sit down as there is a lot to take in... That Liverpool comeback against AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League final was quite the rollercoaster, Jed. The competition as a whole has thrown up some fantastic matches over the years, and it seems many of the most dramatic knockout ties have come at the semi-final stage.

Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Alan Shearer perhaps summed it up best when he rounded off his commentary for broadcaster Amazon Prime by simply thanking both sides. \\\"Thank you Inter Milan, thank you Barcelona for providing us with incredible entertainment and two great football matches,\\\" he said. \\\"What we have witnessed has been something very special. It's been a pleasure to be here.\\\" Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Mat makes sense of it in binary form there, but seriously, where do you start? Players on both sides ended the match in tears, but there were no recriminations at the full-time whistle, just a mutual respect. The emotion flooded out of centre-back Francesco Acerbi, who was pushed forward at the end of normal time and scored his first European goal at the age of 37 to make it 3-3 on the night and 6-6 on aggregate. Inter players rushed to offer their commiserations to Barcelona stars Lamine Yamal and Raphinia, who had done so much to drag their side back from two goals down to the brink of victory, before substitute Davide Frattesi settled the tie with an extra-time winner. Frattesi found the bottom corner with a cultured strike to make it 4-3 on the night, 7-6 on aggregate - the combined 13 goals over the two legs the joint highest for a Champions League semi-final.

It was where he first displayed the leadership qualities that have seen him progress to Arsenal manager and he will welcome PSG to Emirates Stadium on Tuesday in the Champions League. The 18-year-old Arteta, faced with the impossible task of usurping the likes of Pep Guardiola, French World Cup winner Emmanuel Petit, Dutch international Phillip Cocu and Xavi Hernandez in Barcelona\\u2019s star-studded midfield, had moved to the French capital on an 18-month loan deal. PSG were yet to become French football\\u2019s dominant force but had progressed to the second group stage of the Champions League and boasted several big names of their own, including Jay-Jay Okocha, Nicolas Anelka and Mauricio Pochettino. A young Brazilian by the name of Ronaldinho would join the club from Gremio later that year. Arteta barely spoke any French, but a small contingent of Spanish speakers helped him settle quickly into life in Ligue 1 and despite his tender years, the teenager made a big impression at the Parc des Princes. A young Arteta (3rd left) in training with his PSG team-mates One of the first players to take Arteta under his wing was Pochettino, who the Spaniard has since described as his \\u201cbig brother\\u201d and \\u201cfootball father\\u201d. The Argentine, 10 years his senior, also arrived in January 2001 after leaving La Liga side Espanyol and struck up a close bond with his new team-mate as they shared a hotel for the first three months of their time in Paris. Arteta\\u2019s leadership skills, according to Pochettino, were apparent from the outset. \\u201cHe was already a coach,\\u201d he said of his former PSG colleague in 2023. \\u201cHe was giving advice to me and the others. [I\\u2019d] say \\u2018wow!\\u2019 \\u2013 the character, the personality, the charisma. He already had the football brain.\\u201d Arteta grateful for early-career support from Pochettino Arteta was tasked by manager Luis Fernandez \\u2013 who had already tried to sign the teenager while in charge of Athletic Bilbao \\u2013 with orchestrating play from a deep-lying midfield position, a role he fulfilled with a confidence and maturity that belied his age. \\u201cFernandez asked him to play simply and help provide a platform for more creative talents like Okocha, and he carried it out brilliantly,\\u201d French football expert Matt Spiro told BBC Sport. \\u201cArteta was a quiet man but already displayed the steely determination we see in him today. Like most Barcelona players he was technically excellent, but the most surprising and impressive aspect of his game, given his age, was his tactical awareness.\\u201d Arteta made 11 appearances before the end of the campaign, scoring his first PSG goal in a 2-2 draw with Lille on the season\\u2019s penultimate weekend. Despite his fine start, however, Fernandez\\u2019s side ended that term in inauspicious fashion. After losing 4-0 to Auxerre in the French Cup fourth round \\u2013 Arteta\\u2019s debut for the club \\u2013 they finished bottom of their second-round group in the Champions League and only narrowly clinched a top-half finish on the final day of the season. But better times were just around the corner. Arteta: The making of Mikel PSG manager Luis Fernandez (left) had tried to sign Arteta (right) during his time in charge of Athletic Bilbao Victory in that summer\\u2019s Intertoto Cup earned Les Parisiens a place in the first round proper of the 2001-02 Uefa Cup. Including those early-season European games, PSG won eight and drew 10 of their first 18 matches of the campaign, eventually suffering their first defeat at Bordeaux on the final day of September. Arteta played the full 90 minutes in all but one of his 16 league appearances before Christmas, as PSG placed themselves firmly in the mix for a return to the Champions League the following season. \\u201cThe team had style on the pitch,\\u201d Fernandez, who remembers Arteta as a player with \\u201cgood etiquette and behaviour\\u201d, told The Athletic last year. \\u201cThey always met my expectations in relation to the system and the organisation. We were able to make them evolve and grow as players. I am happy to have been able to help them, and Mikel.\\u201d PSG would again fall short in France\\u2019s domestic cup competitions, losing in the French Cup quarter-finals and League Cup semi-finals to Lorient and Bordeaux respectively. But it was a penalty-shootout defeat by Rangers in the Uefa Cup round of 32 that would prove costly in more ways than one, as it marked the beginning of the end of Arteta\\u2019s time at the club. The Glasgow outfit, who knew little of the teenager before the first-leg meeting in late November, were so impressed by his performance across both matches that they decided to offer Barcelona \\u2013 who by that time had Andres Iniesta knocking on the first-team door \\u2013 \\u00a36m for his services. Fernandez had reportedly made the permanent acquisition of Arteta one of his top priorities, but despite holding a purchase option for the midfielder, PSG were beaten to his signature by Alex McLeish\\u2019s side, who agreed a deal in March for Arteta to join in the summer. Arteta on \\u2018survive or die\\u2019 at Rangers Arteta caught the eye of the Rangers hierarchy during a Uefa Cup meeting in late 2001 Confirmation of his imminent departure did little to sour Arteta\\u2019s relationship with the fans at PSG, who ended their Ligue 1 campaign in fourth spot \\u2013 insufficient for a Champions League return but a marked improvement on ninth the previous year, and enough at least to guarantee Uefa Cup football for another season. Arteta ended 2001-02 on 42 appearances in all competitions, his modest return of eight goal involvements misrepresentative of the overall impact he had during his loan spell. As PSG supporters prepare to travel to Emirates Stadium on 1 October, conversations among a certain vintage may turn to their former midfield orchestrator who, in the intervening decades, has blossomed into one of the brightest tactical minds in the game. \\u201cArteta was a major success during his 18 months at PSG,\\u201d said Spiro. \\u201cEverybody was disappointed they didn\\u2019t manage to keep him longer. \\u201cThey didn\\u2019t win any trophies, but fans still recall that period \\u2013 and Arteta \\u2013 with great fondness.\\u201d Latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views Get Arsenal news sent straight to your phone Champions League reaction as Inter beat Barcelona in thriller to reach final 'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end 'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls Preview the forthcoming drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103 Watchlist Add BBC Trailers to your Watchlist in iPlayer A gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean Bean Watchlist Add This City Is Ours to your Watchlist in iPlayer Stacey Dooley explores Britain\\u2019s shoplifting epidemic Watchlist Add Stacey Dooley to your Watchlist in iPlayer Rock group, Jethro Tull, at home, in the studio and on tour Watchlist Add The Lively Arts to your Watchlist in iPlayer 'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?

Americans will be required to switch to the enhanced form of identification by Wednesday, May 7, if they want to travel by plane domestically. If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance. An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%. Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline. The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner. The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear. Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport. Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \\u2014 including TSA checkpoints \\u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification. That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license. The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \\\"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\\\" according to the Department of Homeland Security. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009. You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website. Five states \\u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \\u2014 issue what is called an Enhanced Driver's License (EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card. Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \\\"Enhanced\\\" at the top of the card. Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically. Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \\u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID. Prices vary by state. In New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \\\"one-time $30 Real ID fee\\\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs. It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs. Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID. Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments. A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security. TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification. \\\"We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,\\\" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia. If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards. No. You will still need a valid passport to travel outside of the country and go on international cruises.

The fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain said Tuesday that it is partnering with Paradox, a maker of what the technology company calls \\\"conversational\\\" AI, to launch the new hiring platform. By collecting basic information about candidates, Ava will free up restaurant managers to focus on other tasks, according to the company. The AI can also schedule interviews and even make job offers in real time, the company said. Ava is also a polyglot and able to conduct interviews in English, Spanish, French and German. The new technology is expected to reduce the amount of time it takes Chipotle to hire an employee for an in-restaurant position by as much 75%, Chipotle said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. Chipotle plans to deploy the system across more than 3,500 restaurant locations in North America and Europe. The technology is currently being introduced at restaurants in a phased approach that's expected to be complete by the end of October. In addition to collecting biographical information, Ava can engage with job applicants and answer their questions about the company, according to Chipotle. \\\"Paradox operates as if we've hired additional administrative support for all our restaurants, freeing up more time for managers to support team members and provide an exceptional guest experience. We're excited about the early improvements we're seeing,\\\" Chipotle chief human resources officer Ilene Eskenazi said in a statement. A number of other major restaurant chains, retailers and other companies have turned to Paradox's AI hiring tech, including Applebee's, McDonald's, Panera Bread, Taco Bell and Wendy's. Although AI can expedite the hiring process, it can also be controversial as a recruiting tool. Some studies have found that it can lead to biased assessment of candidates and unintentionally discriminate against people based on their race or gender. To guard against the misuse of AI in hiring, New York City in 2021 passed a law that requires companies that use the technology to disclose its use to job candidates. Employers are also required to conduct annual third-party \\\"bias audits\\\" of their automated hiring systems to ensure the technology isn't discriminating against certain types of candidates.

As U.S. tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports take hold, supplies of a broad range of products could start to dwindle later this summer as back-to-school and holiday spending heat up. Experts warn that the sharp decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. or elsewhere that use materials or inputs from China. Many American retailers rushed to build up their inventories ahead of President Trump's sweeping levies, leading to a recent spike in imports. Imports have since slowed, with a number of retailers foregoing orders on apparel, baby goods and other items that would typically be headed toward U.S. ports. \\\"Once this pull-forward effect fades, U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls and restocking challenges, especially for back-to-school and holiday goods,\\\" analysts with investment bank TD Cowen wrote in a research note that assessed the impact of tariffs on supply chains. \\\"Companies and products with high exposure to China and its manufacturing are most at risk of shortages,\\\" they added. The types of goods whose supplies were pulled forward as companies stocked up include computers, cars, cell phones and electric storage batteries, according to the financial firm. The financial firm cited data from the Port of Los Angeles, which along with the Port of Long Beach receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia. Following the pre-tariff spike in imports, container bookings from China to the U.S. have gone down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company. So-called \\\"blank sailings,\\\" or canceled voyages to the Port of Los Angeles rose to 17 in May, from just six in the month of April, TD Cowen found. There is a wide range of goods that U.S.-based sellers import from China and that are most at risk of becoming scarce because of the trade war. \\\"Among them, toys stand out as particularly vulnerable, raising concerns about potential shortages during the critical holiday season,\\\" TD Cowen analysts noted. Here are some products from China that could soon be hard to come by in the U.S. as a result of tariffs, according to TD Cowen's analysis. Down feathers: The U.S. imports $1.9 billion in down feathers from China. That amounts to 77% of the country's total imported supply of down. Down is commonly used for insulation in comforters and outerwear. Toys, games and sports equipment: More than $30 billion in toys, games and sports equipment sold in the U.S. is imported from China. That accounts for just over 73% of the country's total imports in the category. The trade war could spell shortages in children's toys come Christmastime, experts, as well as President Trump, have warned. Textile art: The U.S. imports $8.6 billion in textile art from China. That accounts for over half of all the textile art the country imports from abroad. Footwear: The U.S. is highly reliant on China for shoes. It imports $9.8 billion's worth, or 36% of footwear sold stateside. Sportswear giant Adidas for one, has warned that it expects to raise prices for U.S. customers because of tariffs. Cutlery: Dinner utensils manufactured in China could also start becoming scarce. The U.S. imports $3.1 billion in cutlery and metal tools from the country. Glassware: Almost 30% of U.S. imports of glassware and other products made of glass comes from China. Furniture and bedding: $18.5 billion's worth of furniture and bedding comes from China. That's 28% of all U.S. imports in the category. Apparel: $17.3 billion's worth of apparel is imported from China. That includes knit or crocheted clothing (almost $10 billion) and not-knit apparel ($7.3 billion). Beyond higher costs for consumer goods, businesses in a range of industries could face other tariff-related challenges, TD Cowen found. For example, the U.S. imports $124 billion in electric machinery; $82 billion in nuclear reactors, boilers and other machinery; $12 billion in goods made of iron or steel; and $19.3 billion in plastics from China each year, according to data from the International Trade Administration.

Americans will be required to switch to the enhanced form of identification by Wednesday, May 7, if they want to travel by plane domestically. If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance. An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%. Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline. The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner. The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear. Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport. Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \\u2014 including TSA checkpoints \\u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification. That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license. The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \\\"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\\\" according to the Department of Homeland Security. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009. You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website. Five states \\u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \\u2014 issue what is called an Enhanced Driver's License (EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card. Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \\\"Enhanced\\\" at the top of the card. Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically. Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \\u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID. Prices vary by state. In New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \\\"one-time $30 Real ID fee\\\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs. It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs. Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID. Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments. A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security. TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification. \\\"We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,\\\" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia. If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards. No. You will still need a valid passport to travel outside of the country and go on international cruises.

The fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain said Tuesday that it is partnering with Paradox, a maker of what the technology company calls \\\"conversational\\\" AI, to launch the new hiring platform. By collecting basic information about candidates, Ava will free up restaurant managers to focus on other tasks, according to the company. The AI can also schedule interviews and even make job offers in real time, the company said. Ava is also a polyglot and able to conduct interviews in English, Spanish, French and German. The new technology is expected to reduce the amount of time it takes Chipotle to hire an employee for an in-restaurant position by as much 75%, Chipotle said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. Chipotle plans to deploy the system across more than 3,500 restaurant locations in North America and Europe. The technology is currently being introduced at restaurants in a phased approach that's expected to be complete by the end of October. In addition to collecting biographical information, Ava can engage with job applicants and answer their questions about the company, according to Chipotle. \\\"Paradox operates as if we've hired additional administrative support for all our restaurants, freeing up more time for managers to support team members and provide an exceptional guest experience. We're excited about the early improvements we're seeing,\\\" Chipotle chief human resources officer Ilene Eskenazi said in a statement. A number of other major restaurant chains, retailers and other companies have turned to Paradox's AI hiring tech, including Applebee's, McDonald's, Panera Bread, Taco Bell and Wendy's. Although AI can expedite the hiring process, it can also be controversial as a recruiting tool. Some studies have found that it can lead to biased assessment of candidates and unintentionally discriminate against people based on their race or gender. To guard against the misuse of AI in hiring, New York City in 2021 passed a law that requires companies that use the technology to disclose its use to job candidates. Employers are also required to conduct annual third-party \\\"bias audits\\\" of their automated hiring systems to ensure the technology isn't discriminating against certain types of candidates.

As U.S. tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports take hold, supplies of a broad range of products could start to dwindle later this summer as back-to-school and holiday spending heat up. Experts warn that the sharp decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. or elsewhere that use materials or inputs from China. Many American retailers rushed to build up their inventories ahead of President Trump's sweeping levies, leading to a recent spike in imports. Imports have since slowed, with a number of retailers foregoing orders on apparel, baby goods and other items that would typically be headed toward U.S. ports. \\\"Once this pull-forward effect fades, U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls and restocking challenges, especially for back-to-school and holiday goods,\\\" analysts with investment bank TD Cowen wrote in a research note that assessed the impact of tariffs on supply chains. \\\"Companies and products with high exposure to China and its manufacturing are most at risk of shortages,\\\" they added. The types of goods whose supplies were pulled forward as companies stocked up include computers, cars, cell phones and electric storage batteries, according to the financial firm. The financial firm cited data from the Port of Los Angeles, which along with the Port of Long Beach receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia. Following the pre-tariff spike in imports, container bookings from China to the U.S. have gone down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company. So-called \\\"blank sailings,\\\" or canceled voyages to the Port of Los Angeles rose to 17 in May, from just six in the month of April, TD Cowen found. There is a wide range of goods that U.S.-based sellers import from China and that are most at risk of becoming scarce because of the trade war. \\\"Among them, toys stand out as particularly vulnerable, raising concerns about potential shortages during the critical holiday season,\\\" TD Cowen analysts noted. Here are some products from China that could soon be hard to come by in the U.S. as a result of tariffs, according to TD Cowen's analysis. Down feathers: The U.S. imports $1.9 billion in down feathers from China. That amounts to 77% of the country's total imported supply of down. Down is commonly used for insulation in comforters and outerwear. Toys, games and sports equipment: More than $30 billion in toys, games and sports equipment sold in the U.S. is imported from China. That accounts for just over 73% of the country's total imports in the category. The trade war could spell shortages in children's toys come Christmastime, experts, as well as President Trump, have warned. Textile art: The U.S. imports $8.6 billion in textile art from China. That accounts for over half of all the textile art the country imports from abroad. Footwear: The U.S. is highly reliant on China for shoes. It imports $9.8 billion's worth, or 36% of footwear sold stateside. Sportswear giant Adidas for one, has warned that it expects to raise prices for U.S. customers because of tariffs. Cutlery: Dinner utensils manufactured in China could also start becoming scarce. The U.S. imports $3.1 billion in cutlery and metal tools from the country. Glassware: Almost 30% of U.S. imports of glassware and other products made of glass comes from China. Furniture and bedding: $18.5 billion's worth of furniture and bedding comes from China. That's 28% of all U.S. imports in the category. Apparel: $17.3 billion's worth of apparel is imported from China. That includes knit or crocheted clothing (almost $10 billion) and not-knit apparel ($7.3 billion). Beyond higher costs for consumer goods, businesses in a range of industries could face other tariff-related challenges, TD Cowen found. For example, the U.S. imports $124 billion in electric machinery; $82 billion in nuclear reactors, boilers and other machinery; $12 billion in goods made of iron or steel; and $19.3 billion in plastics from China each year, according to data from the International Trade Administration.

The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \\\"we need to start moving forward.\\\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. \\\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\\\" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \\\"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\\\" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. \\\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\\\" Merkley said in a statement. \\\"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\\\" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \\\"serious risks\\\" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \\u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \\\"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\\\" \\\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\\\" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the \\\"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\\\" and sets a \\\"historic precedent.\\\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

Abraham Lincoln: \\\"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\\\" Mary Todd Lincoln: \\\"How would it look? Sensational!!\\\" It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together. Abraham Lincoln: \\\"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\\\" Mary Todd Lincoln: \\\"With who?\\\" Abraham Lincoln: \\\"The south!\\\" Mary Todd Lincoln: \\\"Of what?\\\" It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\\\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\\\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records. What does that say? \\\"Inflation is high,\\\" Escola laughed. Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \\\"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\\\" But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \\\"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \\u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\\\" Escola said. \\\"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\\\" Escola eventually wrote the play. \\\"Oh, Mary!\\\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor). It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \\\"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\\\" The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \\\"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\\\" I asked, \\\"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\\\" \\\"No, no,\\\" Escola replied. \\\"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\\\" \\\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\\\" \\\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\\\" Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \\\"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\\\" Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt. I asked, \\\"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\\\" \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\\\" \\\"No,\\\" said Escola. \\\"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\\\" Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\\\"It was New York or bust!\\\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \\\"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.' \\\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\\\" Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \\\"Mom Commercial\\\" (2015): \\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \\\"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\\\" And then along came Mary. I said, \\\"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\\\" \\\"No,\\\" Escola said. \\\"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\\\" WEB EXCLUSIVE: Watch an extended interview with Cole Escola, including a visit to his dressing room: For more info: Story produced by Amol Mhatre. Editor: Steven Tyler.

Najjar's debut novel follows Lola Fine, a New York City content creator who retreats to the Hamptons after being canceled, only to discover her summer neighbor is a culture critic who wrote a scathing expos\\u00e9 about her. The two unexpectedly begin a summer fling as Lola embarks on a journey of self-discovery. \\\"I really wanted my heroine to be complicated and layered, because we're all complicated and layered,\\\" Najjar told \\\"CBS Mornings.\\\" \\\"I wanted her to be messy so that readers could see themselves in her, because we're really all imperfect. We're all works in progress.\\\" The Hamptons setting was chosen for its luxury and dramatic potential, Najjar said. \\\"My followers know my obsession with rich mom places. And it's shrouded in mystery. It's luxurious. A lot of drama goes down there,\\\" she said. She even incorporated real locations to provide reference points for readers. The book includes aspects of queer romance, which has drawn some criticism given Najjar's identity as a straight woman. Najjar said that she worked with a queer collaborator to ensure authentic representation. \\\"I think it's important to have a queer voice in the room, and that's why I wanted to work with a queer collaborator,\\\" she said. \\\"So we got that lived experience in the book and I think we nailed it, and it was an incredible experience working with her. I can't wait for people to just read it and form their own opinions.\\\" Analisa Novak is a content producer for CBS News and the Emmy Award-winning \\\"CBS Mornings.\\\" Based in Chicago, she specializes in covering live events and exclusive interviews for the show.

The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \\\"we need to start moving forward.\\\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. \\\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\\\" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \\\"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\\\" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. \\\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\\\" Merkley said in a statement. \\\"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\\\" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \\\"serious risks\\\" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \\u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \\\"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\\\" \\\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\\\" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the \\\"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\\\" and sets a \\\"historic precedent.\\\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together. Abraham Lincoln: \\\"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\\\" Mary Todd Lincoln: \\\"With who?\\\" Abraham Lincoln: \\\"The south!\\\" Mary Todd Lincoln: \\\"Of what?\\\" It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\\\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\\\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records. What does that say? \\\"Inflation is high,\\\" Escola laughed. Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \\\"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\\\" But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \\\"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \\u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\\\" Escola said. \\\"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\\\" Escola eventually wrote the play. \\\"Oh, Mary!\\\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor). It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \\\"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\\\" The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \\\"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\\\" I asked, \\\"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\\\" \\\"No, no,\\\" Escola replied. \\\"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\\\" \\\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\\\" \\\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\\\" Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \\\"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\\\" Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt. I asked, \\\"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\\\" \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\\\" \\\"No,\\\" said Escola. \\\"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\\\" Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\\\"It was New York or bust!\\\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \\\"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.' \\\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\\\" Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \\\"Mom Commercial\\\" (2015): \\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \\\"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\\\" And then along came Mary. I said, \\\"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\\\" \\\"No,\\\" Escola said. \\\"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\\\" WEB EXCLUSIVE: Watch an extended interview with Cole Escola, including a visit to his dressing room: For more info: Story produced by Amol Mhatre. Editor: Steven Tyler.

Najjar's debut novel follows Lola Fine, a New York City content creator who retreats to the Hamptons after being canceled, only to discover her summer neighbor is a culture critic who wrote a scathing expos\\u00e9 about her. The two unexpectedly begin a summer fling as Lola embarks on a journey of self-discovery. \\\"I really wanted my heroine to be complicated and layered, because we're all complicated and layered,\\\" Najjar told \\\"CBS Mornings.\\\" \\\"I wanted her to be messy so that readers could see themselves in her, because we're really all imperfect. We're all works in progress.\\\" The Hamptons setting was chosen for its luxury and dramatic potential, Najjar said. \\\"My followers know my obsession with rich mom places. And it's shrouded in mystery. It's luxurious. A lot of drama goes down there,\\\" she said. She even incorporated real locations to provide reference points for readers. The book includes aspects of queer romance, which has drawn some criticism given Najjar's identity as a straight woman. Najjar said that she worked with a queer collaborator to ensure authentic representation. \\\"I think it's important to have a queer voice in the room, and that's why I wanted to work with a queer collaborator,\\\" she said. \\\"So we got that lived experience in the book and I think we nailed it, and it was an incredible experience working with her. I can't wait for people to just read it and form their own opinions.\\\" Analisa Novak is a content producer for CBS News and the Emmy Award-winning \\\"CBS Mornings.\\\" Based in Chicago, she specializes in covering live events and exclusive interviews for the show.

With the Mariners trailing by one, Jorge Polanco drew a one-out walk from reliever Tyler Ferguson (0-1) in the ninth. Rodr\\u00edguez followed with a single and Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Raleigh's single to right field gave Seattle a 4-3 lead, and Dylan Moore added a sacrifice fly. Carlos Vargas got three outs for his first major league save, retiring pinch-hitter Seth Brown with two on to end it. Collin Snider (1-0) gave up a go-ahead single to Miguel Andujar in the eighth but prevented further damage. Seattle is 17\\u20136 since April 9, the best record in the big leagues during that span. J.P. Crawford singled in the fifth to extend the longest active hitting streak in the majors to a career-best 14 games. Rodr\\u00edguez homered in the first inning and Miles Mastrobuoni had an RBI double for the Mariners in the second. Brent Rooker and Tyler Soderstrom each had three hits for the Athletics. Andujar added two hits and two RBIs. Rooker also scored twice \\u2014 and stole two bases for the first time in his career. Mariners relievers Gabe Speier and Snider got bases-loaded strikeouts to end the seventh and eighth innings, respectively. Seattle is 8-0-2 in its last 10 series with the Athletics and 47\\u201316 over its last 63 games against the A's. Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (4-1, 1.58 ERA) is scheduled to start the series finale Wednesday against RHP Gunnar Hoglund (1-0, 1.50), who beat Miami in his MLB debut last Friday.\",\n          \"WEST SACRAMENTO \\u2014 Jacob Wilson singled home the winning run in the 11th inning to give the Athletics a 7-6 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night in the opener of a three-game series between the top two teams in the AL West. Wilson finished with three hits and three RBIs, including a tying single against Mariners closer Andr\\u00e9s Mu\\u00f1oz leading off the 10th that scored automatic runner JJ Bleday. The Athletics then loaded the bases with nobody out, but Mu\\u00f1oz struck out the next three batters and still has not allowed an earned run this season. One inning later, a sacrifice bunt by Gio Urshela and two intentional walks loaded the bases for Wilson. He smacked a one-out single off Casey Legumina (2-1) through the middle of a drawn-in infield as the Athletics pulled within a game of the first-place Mariners. It was Wilson's third walk-off hit in 62 major league games and second this season. Hogan Harris (1-0) got the win with a scoreless 11th. Miguel Andujar's sacrifice fly in the first and Wilson's RBI single in the second staked the Athletics to a 2-0 lead. Jorge Polanco, Rowdy Tellez, Miles Mastrobuoni and Ben Williamson each drove in a run in the third off Athletics starter Luis Severino to put Seattle ahead 4-2. Shea Langeliers led off the fourth with his eighth homer and Lawrence Butler tied it with a two-out RBI single. Langeliers' sacrifice fly off Collin Snider in the seventh gave the Athletics a 5-4 advantage. Cal Raleigh drew a walk from Grant Holman in the eighth and scored on a two-out single by Williamson to tie it. Seattle starter Bryce Miller allowed four runs and seven hits in four innings. Severino permitted four runs on five hits and four walks in six innings. Athletics closer Mason Miller walked two in the ninth before coming back to strike out Raleigh for the third out. The Mariners are looking to win nine consecutive series for the first time since taking a franchise-record 15 straight in 2001. Mariners RHP Emerson Hancock (1-1, 6.62 ERA) starts the middle game of the series Tuesday night against LHP Jeffrey Springs (4-3, 4.98).\",\n          \"A Bay Area startup is taking a different approach in an attempt to help solve the housing crisis by using a matchmaking platform to connect college students and homeowners. When most students have called it a day, Nanik Tagore is just getting started. A shooting guard for the Dominican University men's basketball team, he's got range, control and a shot that rarely misses. But when it came time to find housing in the Bay Area, he was out of his league. \\\"San Rafael is one of the most expensive places to live,\\\" Tagore said. \\\"So, I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to live on my own.\\\" That's when he came across a new startup called Joey \\u2014 a platform that matches students with homeowners who need a little help around the house. Tagore now pays $1,700 for a room in Marin County. But he works off about $500 of that doing chores that don't show up on a resume but say a lot about a person: walking the dog, sorting the mail, taking out the trash, even making lunch. Because of employment regulations, renters in the Joey program pay full rent upfront, then get reimbursed for the hours they work \\u2014 a workaround designed to stay compliant with labor laws. He now lives with Paige and Jason Miller, a couple who could use the help. Jason is a full-time caregiver. Paige Miller is living with early-stage dementia. She can't drive, and Jason works long hours running a company. \\\"My worry actually was Paige,\\\" Jason Miller said. \\\"Would she feel comfortable having somebody else live in the house?\\\" Turns out, she was more than comfortable. \\\"It gives me back my freedom,\\\" Paige Miller said. \\\"And he's great to have around. He laughs at my jokes.\\\" With roughly 60% of U.S. homes containing at least one spare bedroom, Joey's founder Alison Donnally sees untapped potential. \\\"It just didn't make sense to me why we couldn't have something similar to an au pair, but for older adults,\\\" she said. Tagore is the first person to be placed through the app, but Donnally said applications are already being processed. \\\"What we can do at JoeyCo is create more bedroom inventory for these students,\\\" she said. As for Tagore, he said he's found more than just a place to stay. \\\"It doesn't feel like work,\\\" he said. \\\"It doesn't feel like a chore to lend a helping hand.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"published_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"May 6, 2025 / 11:23 PM PDT / AP\",\n          \"May 5, 2025 / 11:34 PM PDT / AP\",\n          \"May 6, 2025 / 6:50 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"writer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tim Fang\",\n          \"Jose Fabian\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

With the Mariners trailing by one, Jorge Polanco drew a one-out walk from reliever Tyler Ferguson (0-1) in the ninth. Rodr\\u00edguez followed with a single and Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Raleigh's single to right field gave Seattle a 4-3 lead, and Dylan Moore added a sacrifice fly. Carlos Vargas got three outs for his first major league save, retiring pinch-hitter Seth Brown with two on to end it. Collin Snider (1-0) gave up a go-ahead single to Miguel Andujar in the eighth but prevented further damage. Seattle is 17\\u20136 since April 9, the best record in the big leagues during that span. J.P. Crawford singled in the fifth to extend the longest active hitting streak in the majors to a career-best 14 games. Rodr\\u00edguez homered in the first inning and Miles Mastrobuoni had an RBI double for the Mariners in the second. Brent Rooker and Tyler Soderstrom each had three hits for the Athletics. Andujar added two hits and two RBIs. Rooker also scored twice \\u2014 and stole two bases for the first time in his career. Mariners relievers Gabe Speier and Snider got bases-loaded strikeouts to end the seventh and eighth innings, respectively. Seattle is 8-0-2 in its last 10 series with the Athletics and 47\\u201316 over its last 63 games against the A's. Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (4-1, 1.58 ERA) is scheduled to start the series finale Wednesday against RHP Gunnar Hoglund (1-0, 1.50), who beat Miami in his MLB debut last Friday.\",\n          \"WEST SACRAMENTO \\u2014 Jacob Wilson singled home the winning run in the 11th inning to give the Athletics a 7-6 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night in the opener of a three-game series between the top two teams in the AL West. Wilson finished with three hits and three RBIs, including a tying single against Mariners closer Andr\\u00e9s Mu\\u00f1oz leading off the 10th that scored automatic runner JJ Bleday. The Athletics then loaded the bases with nobody out, but Mu\\u00f1oz struck out the next three batters and still has not allowed an earned run this season. One inning later, a sacrifice bunt by Gio Urshela and two intentional walks loaded the bases for Wilson. He smacked a one-out single off Casey Legumina (2-1) through the middle of a drawn-in infield as the Athletics pulled within a game of the first-place Mariners. It was Wilson's third walk-off hit in 62 major league games and second this season. Hogan Harris (1-0) got the win with a scoreless 11th. Miguel Andujar's sacrifice fly in the first and Wilson's RBI single in the second staked the Athletics to a 2-0 lead. Jorge Polanco, Rowdy Tellez, Miles Mastrobuoni and Ben Williamson each drove in a run in the third off Athletics starter Luis Severino to put Seattle ahead 4-2. Shea Langeliers led off the fourth with his eighth homer and Lawrence Butler tied it with a two-out RBI single. Langeliers' sacrifice fly off Collin Snider in the seventh gave the Athletics a 5-4 advantage. Cal Raleigh drew a walk from Grant Holman in the eighth and scored on a two-out single by Williamson to tie it. Seattle starter Bryce Miller allowed four runs and seven hits in four innings. Severino permitted four runs on five hits and four walks in six innings. Athletics closer Mason Miller walked two in the ninth before coming back to strike out Raleigh for the third out. The Mariners are looking to win nine consecutive series for the first time since taking a franchise-record 15 straight in 2001. Mariners RHP Emerson Hancock (1-1, 6.62 ERA) starts the middle game of the series Tuesday night against LHP Jeffrey Springs (4-3, 4.98).\",\n          \"A Bay Area startup is taking a different approach in an attempt to help solve the housing crisis by using a matchmaking platform to connect college students and homeowners. When most students have called it a day, Nanik Tagore is just getting started. A shooting guard for the Dominican University men's basketball team, he's got range, control and a shot that rarely misses. But when it came time to find housing in the Bay Area, he was out of his league. \\\"San Rafael is one of the most expensive places to live,\\\" Tagore said. \\\"So, I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to live on my own.\\\" That's when he came across a new startup called Joey \\u2014 a platform that matches students with homeowners who need a little help around the house. Tagore now pays $1,700 for a room in Marin County. But he works off about $500 of that doing chores that don't show up on a resume but say a lot about a person: walking the dog, sorting the mail, taking out the trash, even making lunch. Because of employment regulations, renters in the Joey program pay full rent upfront, then get reimbursed for the hours they work \\u2014 a workaround designed to stay compliant with labor laws. He now lives with Paige and Jason Miller, a couple who could use the help. Jason is a full-time caregiver. Paige Miller is living with early-stage dementia. She can't drive, and Jason works long hours running a company. \\\"My worry actually was Paige,\\\" Jason Miller said. \\\"Would she feel comfortable having somebody else live in the house?\\\" Turns out, she was more than comfortable. \\\"It gives me back my freedom,\\\" Paige Miller said. \\\"And he's great to have around. He laughs at my jokes.\\\" With roughly 60% of U.S. homes containing at least one spare bedroom, Joey's founder Alison Donnally sees untapped potential. \\\"It just didn't make sense to me why we couldn't have something similar to an au pair, but for older adults,\\\" she said. Tagore is the first person to be placed through the app, but Donnally said applications are already being processed. \\\"What we can do at JoeyCo is create more bedroom inventory for these students,\\\" she said.

It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics. \\\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\\\" Harris told Vogue. \\\"Artistic expression \\u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \\u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\\\" To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit \\\"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\\\" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said. While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States. Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own. Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028. \\\"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\\\" she said. Sources familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office.

The facility struggles financially, given its small size and the area's tiny population. But for over a decade, the Hugo, Colorado-based health system has remained afloat partially thanks to a surprising source: special taxes on the state's hospitals. The taxes Lincoln pays help cover the state's Medicaid costs and \\u2014 because the federal government matches a portion of what states spend on Medicaid \\u2014 enable Colorado to claim more federal money. That generally leads to more dollars for the hospital. The tax proceeds also have helped Colorado expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover 400,000 more low-income adults, significantly reducing the number of people showing up at hospital doors without insurance. Last year, Lincoln paid $500,000 in provider taxes but netted more than $3.6 million extra from Medicaid, accounting for about 15% of its budget, said Lincoln CEO Kevin Stansbury. \\\"These dollars allow me to care for patients who are enrolled in Medicaid and to break even rather than lose money,\\\" he said. \\\"Without them, it would significantly impact our ability to survive.\\\" Every state except Alaska uses at least one provider tax to boost its federal Medicaid dollars. But Republicans who control Congress are looking for potential cuts in the nearly $900 billion Medicaid program to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts \\u2014 and have sought to portray provider taxes as malicious, sometimes even deriding them as \\\"money laundering.\\\" Lawmakers say they may curtail or eliminate provider taxes as part of legislation to enact Mr. Trump's domestic agenda. \\\"It's infuriating,\\\" Stansbury said. Medicaid and the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program together cover roughly 79 million low-income and disabled people and are jointly financed by states and the federal government. Federal dollars match state payments with no limit. While the split varies based on a state's per capita income, the federal match ranges from 50% to 77% for children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, who make up most of the enrollment. States started using provider taxes in the 1980s to help pay their share and gain additional Medicaid funds from the federal government. Brian Blase, a former Trump health policy adviser who leads the conservative Paragon Health Institute, sees provider taxes as one of the highest forms of waste in Medicaid. States and their hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers aren't held accountable for how the tax money is used, reducing incentives for states to control Medicaid spending, he said. \\\"This has been a feature of the program for four decades, and it is a feature that is getting worse,\\\" Blase said. The Congressional Budget Office estimates eliminating provider taxes would save the federal government more than $600 billion over a decade. Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), who chairs the House committee that oversees Medicaid, has said provider taxes are on the menu for potential cuts. Other changes Republicans are considering to cut federal Medicaid spending include requiring adult enrollees to prove they're working as a condition of eligibility, as well as ending higher payments for adults enrolled as part of the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program. Since 2014, more than 20 million nondisabled adults in 40 states and Washington, D.C., have gained coverage under the expansion. House Republicans have set a Memorial Day deadline to come to an agreement on spending cuts, which would help pay for extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts passed during Mr. Trump's first administration and set to expire at the end of this year. The Government Accountability Office and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a congressional advisory board, have raised concerns about the provider taxes, which effectively saddle federal taxpayers with state expenses. Republican and Democrat presidents have criticized or proposed curtailing the use of Medicaid provider taxes \\u2014 including Mr. Trump in his first term, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden while serving as vice president. But opposition from hospitals, nursing homes, and states snuffed out any move to limit or end the arrangements. Colorado and other states often use the money to maintain or increase payments to providers, which are often paid less by Medicaid than by Medicare, the federal program primarily for people 65 or older, or private insurers. States have added provider taxes to help generate federal money to cope with economic downturns and budget constraints. Hospitals in Idaho last year began paying an additional provider tax to increase pay to hospitals and home- and community-based providers. The tax came as Idaho's Republican-controlled legislature sought to add many conditions that threatened to end the state's Medicaid expansion \\u2014 which would also eliminate a key source of increased federal funding. Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association, said funding from the hospital tax helps boost Medicaid payments to about 80% of Medicare's rates instead of 60%. \\\"We still lose money on every Medicare and Medicaid patient,\\\" he said. \\\"The state recognizes that this money helps offset the losses we take under Medicaid reimbursement.\\\" While hospitals and nursing homes have been the main beneficiaries of provider tax proceeds, ambulance services have also paid and benefited from Medicaid taxes. States increasingly have also approved Medicaid taxes on private insurers that operate their Medicaid programs to gain more federal funds. California's Medicaid managed care tax began in 2009 and is expected to generate nearly $9 billion in net revenue for the 2024-25 fiscal period \\u2014 or about 5% of the state's Medicaid budget, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office. In recent years, California has extended full Medicaid coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal status. Federal law prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to cover people in the country without authorization, but states can use their own money. At a presentation to congressional staffers in April, Blase cited California's strategy as an example of provider tax abuse and claimed the state is effectively laundering federal funds to cover people living in the country illegally. In practice, the tax has been a kind of fiscal pressure valve generally offsetting state spending. A ballot measure that passed in November now requires that much of the money from California's tax specifically be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Hospital officials and state Medicaid leaders argue the term \\\"money laundering\\\" is an inaccurate way to describe provider taxes, since they are allowed by federal law. But Blase said calling the levies a \\\"tax\\\" is misleading, pointing out that most businesses don't typically advocate to pay one. Jamie Whitney, chief legal officer for Texas-based Adelanto HealthCare Ventures, a consulting firm, said that provider taxes are a politically neutral way to help states pay for Medicaid and that curtailing their use would harm them all. \\\"This is not a red-state, blue-state issue,\\\" she said. Colorado is one of more than a dozen states that have funded an ACA Medicaid expansion using provider tax money. Others include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Colorado implemented its Medicaid provider tax effort in 2009. In the 2024 fiscal year, about $5 billion of the state's $15 billion Medicaid program was funded by provider taxes, according to the state. The money helps the state pay higher Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals, which reduces their need to charge higher rates to private insurers, said Kim Bimestefer, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which oversees Medicaid. Some of the extra payments are dependent on hospitals meeting certain quality and patient-safety metrics, such as reducing readmission rates after patients are discharged \\u2014 a requirement state officials say improves care for everyone. The provider taxes also fund a program allowing working residents with disabilities to buy into Medicaid coverage even if their income is as high as 300% of the federal poverty level, or $46,950 for an individual. About 20,000 people are enrolled in the program. Among them is Alison Sbrana, 31, of Fort Collins, Colorado, who has a type of chronic fatigue syndrome and relies on Medicaid to cover long-term home care. \\\"It would be devastating if the benefit went away,\\\" said Sbrana, who works as a researcher and activist for those with the same disorder. \\\"I would be forced to stop working to keep my income low enough to qualify.\\\" The state's provider taxes also pay for a $60 million fund to support rural hospitals, helping them add telehealth services, recruit surgeons, and hire paramedics, according to a state report. Konnie Martin, CEO of San Luis Valley Health, a two-hospital system based in Alamosa, Colorado, said her nonprofit paid $5.4 million in provider taxes last year and gained about $15 million in benefits from higher Medicaid payments and the rural grants. She said the money helps her hospital maintain obstetrical services, so residents don't have to drive 120 miles to the nearest maternity hospital. Without the birthing center, the entire region would suffer, she said. \\\"It also would gut the economy of the community, because young people will move away,\\\" she said.

Among those arrested was a Sinaloa cartel leader, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, 36, a Mexican national, who was taken into custody in Salem, Oregon, Bondi said at a press conference. In February, the State Department designated the Sinaloa cartel as a foreign terrorist organization. Asked whether any of those arrested would be deported to Mexico, Bondi said \\\"I want them to stay in our prisons as long as possible.\\\" \\\"Most of these individuals, if convicted, will remain in American prisons, perhaps Alcatraz,\\\" the attorney general added in reference to the shuttered California prison that President Donald Trump said he wants to reopen. The Justice Department said law enforcement officials seized more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of fentanyl pills, 11.5 kilos of fentanyl powder, 80 kilos of methamphetamine, 7.5 kilos of cocaine and 4.5 kilos of heroin. The bust also netted $5 million in cash and 49 rifles and pistols, U.S. officials said, while releasing several images of the seized items. \\\"This case represents DEA's largest single seizure of fentanyl pills,\\\" said Robert Murphy, the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Bondi said 75,000 Americans are dying each year because of fentanyl and it is the number one cause of death for people between the ages of 18 and 34 in the United States. \\\"They are flooding our cities with a weapon of mass destruction, fentanyl,\\\" she said. Ryan Ellison, U.S. attorney for the district of New Mexico, said the \\\"sophisticated fentanyl and narcotics distribution network\\\" spanned New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. Ellison said the 16 people arrested face various federal charges including conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and firearms offenses. The DEA says drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 44, though most states have seen fewer deaths over the last few years. Between 2022 and 2023, overdose deaths decreased by 4% nationwide, marking the first such decline since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Overdose deaths fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Once the transaction becomes official (presumably today), Tucker will become a free agent. In theory, he\\u2019ll be able to sign immediately with any team. As a practical matter, any interested team will likely wait. The NFL\\u2019s investigation regarding the allegations made against Tucker (he denies them all) will continue. He could eventually be suspended. It\\u2019s sensible to assume that teams will wait for the decision to be made \\u2014 and the suspension, if any, to be served \\u2014 before offering him a roster spot. Beyond the potential P.R. impact of bringing a kicker who doesn\\u2019t kick as well as he once did to town, Tucker\\u2019s next team won\\u2019t know when it will be able to use him until the suspension, if any, is served. If that\\u2019s how it plays out, it becomes important for Tucker to get this behind him as soon as he can. If it lingers into the 2025 season, he\\u2019ll be essentially suspended. That could make a negotiated outcome more attractive to him, with Tucker\\u2019s representatives and the league reaching an agreement on a number of games. The 2020 CBA changed the landscape regarding Personal Conduct Policy cases. Now, a third party conducts a hearing and makes findings of fact that cannot be appealed. There\\u2019s risk for both sides. Judge Sue L. Robinson (who handled the Deshaun Watson case in 2022) could find that the evidence shows wrongdoing by Tucker. She also could find that the evidence falls short of proving that he did anything. Still, if it lingers, Tucker loses. He needs to get this resolved by Week 1, if his goal is to end up with a new team as soon as possible. It\\u2019s still possible for a new team to decide to give him a shot, knowing that if/when he\\u2019s suspended, another kicker will be needed. Still, few teams will want to embrace the scrutiny that would go along with welcoming Tucker to town under the cloud of unresolved allegations involving misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. Especially since the supply of competent kickers always outweighs the demand \\u2014 and since Tucker wasn\\u2019t in 2024 the kicker he used to be.

On Monday, they made an indelicate exit from the relationship. On one hand, there have been no findings that Tucker has done anything wrong, in civil court, criminal court, or the Court of Commissioner Goodell. Indeed, Tucker has unequivocally denied the numerous accusations of misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. On the other hand, he plays a position that is as interchangeable as they come. Especially since Tucker has regressed from his previous perennial Pro Bowl-level performance. When faced with the choice between a run-of-the-mill kicker who is creating a significant distraction and is due to make $4.2 million this year and one who isn\\u2019t, it\\u2019s a no-brainer. And with run-of-the-mill kickers available anywhere and everywhere, the Ravens were always going to be moving on from Tucker. They opted to do the dance. To wait until after the start of the new league year in March, when Tucker could be released with a post-June 1 designation and significant 2025 cap savings. To wait until after they could use a sixth-round pick on Arizona kicker Tyler Loop, without their potential selection of a kicker during the draft being obvious. To wait until they could get a look at Loop during this weekend\\u2019s rookie minicamp. The fact that it was couched by G.M. Eric DeCosta as a \\u201cfootball decision\\u201d is no surprise. Players are released for football reasons all the time. There\\u2019s no mechanism in the Collective Bargaining Agreement for challenging the constant churn of football decisions. If the decision was influenced (as it likely was) in whole or in part by non-football reasons, the Ravens would have invited a potential CBA issue by saying so. At a minimum, Tucker could have argued under the \\u201cone punishment\\u201d principle that the team\\u2019s decision to release him in the aftermath of the allegations should short-circuit the pending Personal Conduct Policy investigation. (He still could.) This was all strategic and calculated by the Ravens, as all best-interests-of-the-team decisions are. After the Ravens\\u2019 2024 playoff run ended, DeCosta said he expects Tucker to be the Ravens\\u2019 kicker in 2025. Then came the allegations. Instead of immediately applying a supposed \\u201czero tolerance\\u201d policy to Tucker, the Ravens waited. They weathered a P.R. storm that was more like a light drizzle. And they were able to wait for the draft (and rookie minicamp) to come and go before making a move. On Sunday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh emphasized that the team would make football decisions only about Tucker. The next day, they made one. It most likely wasn\\u2019t only a football decision. But there\\u2019s no way to prove it, because the Ravens have said (and not said) all the right things about Tucker\\u2019s off-field situation. All that said, DeCosta\\u2019s statement seemed to be a little bit over the top. As noted by Brandon Kleen of AwfulAnnouncing.com, multiple members of the sports media have questioned the tone and content of the team\\u2019s announcement. The Ravens likely would prefer to be dragged until the next bright, shiny object distracts the media (i.e., tomorrow morning at the latest) than risk inviting an argument that they were influenced by Tucker\\u2019s off-field situation. Still, here\\u2019s what we (or at least I) think the Ravens would have said, if they were being candid and direct: \\u201cJustin has been a great kicker. Last year, he wasn\\u2019t as great as he\\u2019d been. We were willing to give him a chance to get back on track. But the off-field allegations became just too much. If it had been one or two people, we\\u2019d be willing to let it play out. But 16? It\\u2019s hard to think they all are lying, and he\\u2019s currently not good enough to justify circling the wagons until it plays out.\\u201d Obviously, they didn\\u2019t say it that way. And they\\u2019ll take some P.R. heat for it. Still, it will be very difficult for Tucker to do anything about it. And that likely has been the plan from the moment the Ravens realized they couldn\\u2019t and wouldn\\u2019t bring him back for 2025.

Now that quarterback Matthew Stafford\\u2019s new deal with the Rams is officially done, the two-year deal will once again tee up the question, after the next season, of whether the Rams and Stafford are done. He ends up with $44 million this year, with no guarantees beyond 2025 \\u2014 for injury or otherwise. The Rams will have until the fifth day of the next league year in March, when his 2026 salary of $40 million becomes fully guaranteed, to cut him. The Rams also will have the ability to trade Stafford, since they\\u2019ll hold his contractual rights through 2026. We don\\u2019t, and won\\u2019t, know whether the Rams have informally agreed to grant Stafford his outright release, if he decides he wants to finish his career elsewhere. If a new team can sign him without giving the Rams a draft pick or two, that\\u2019s more money they\\u2019ll be willing to pay Stafford next year. He could have gotten a firm $90 million (or more) on a two-year deal with the Raiders or Giants. But Stafford seems to be content to go one year at a time with the Rams, confident that another team (if not the Rams) will pay him fairly in 2026. It\\u2019s a good deal for the Rams. At $42 million per year on his new contract, Stafford currently ranks 15th in the NFL. And he\\u2019s still better than the 15th best quarterback. And Stafford, unlike plenty of starting quarterbacks, is willing to play in the current year with no financial security beyond it.

Much of the midcentury modern architecture and designs have remained untouched since the space opened in the 1950s. The massive tech campus was built during a time when the Detroit automaker reigned supreme. It was GM\\u2019s so-called Golden Era, with its luxury Cadillac brand leading the way as \\u201cthe standard of the world\\u201d \\u2014 before decades of U.S. market share declines amid increased competition from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and others. GM President Mark Reuss wasn\\u2019t alive to witness that era, but he\\u2019s harkened back to it as he and his teams have methodically overseen a product renaissance for Cadillac, which wants to regain its prominence as the American luxury brand. \\u201cThere isn\\u2019t a lot of American luxury brands. There just isn\\u2019t. I think it\\u2019s time, and I\\u2019m deeply passionate about that, for GM and Cadillac to show the world what we can do,\\u201d Reuss told CNBC from his second-story office adjacent to the lobby. Cadillac\\u2019s domestic competition has historically been Ford Motor\\u2019s Lincoln luxury brand, which sells roughly a third of the vehicles in the U.S. as its GM competitor. Other luxury brands from Germany, Japan and, more recently, South Korea have entered the market as well. All-electric vehicle competitors Tesla and Lucid Group are also in the mix. The luxury vehicle market is crucial for automakers. The vehicles have higher profit margins than their mainstream counterparts and cater to a more affluent customer that views them as much as a status symbol as a mode of transportation. Reuss\\u2019 responsibilities as president include overseeing all the automaker\\u2019s products and brands, but he has always taken a special interest in Cadillac, which is on its fourth leader since 2015. Those involved with the brand have described Reuss as a protector, vanguard and even spiritual leader of sorts for Cadillac. While not everything has gone perfectly to plan \\u2014 there have been issues with sales in China and electric vehicle production and adoption \\u2014 Cadillac has largely stayed true to a plan that the company undertook to bolster the luxury brand a decade ago. It\\u2019s a not-so-easy accomplishment amid regulatory uncertainty and budget cuts in an automaker the size of GM. \\u201cIf you would have looked at Cadillac\\u2019s financials and portfolio, it was not delivering,\\u201d Reuss said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s been a long road taking a 150-year-old brand from where it was, which was not healthy. It was not \\u2018the standard of the world.\\u2019 Still isn\\u2019t. We\\u2019ve got work to do, but the vision is there and it\\u2019s pretty clear.\\u201d That vision currently relies heavily on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans and the brand\\u2019s flagship Escalade \\u2014 one of GM\\u2019s longest-standing and most prominent nameplates \\u2014 to bring Cadillac back to prominence. It\\u2019s a race Cadillac executives describe as having a never-ending finish line. In the summer of 2018, Reuss, GM design chief Michael Simcoe and then-Cadillac head Steve Carlisle, among others, mapped out what they wanted Cadillac to be ahead of a broader executive rollout at GM\\u2019s renowned design dome. It was a reevaluation of sorts of a plan laid out for Cadillac in 2015. The overall strategy was to largely isolate Cadillac\\u2019s products from GM\\u2019s other brands and not allow the sharing of consumer-focused parts. They would share some bones, motors and other powertrain parts, but the interiors and even some of the engines would be exclusively Cadillac. \\u201cWe wanted to lay tracks down in terms of what the brand could be. We didn\\u2019t have a very consistent approach,\\u201d Carlisle recalled during a phone interview. \\u201cMany have tried and most have failed.\\u201d The idea was to get Cadillac\\u2019s portfolio back into shape with sporty, sleek vehicles that elevate the brand\\u2019s status and, in turn, lead to higher residual values of the vehicles. The brand also sought to lower incentives. Reuss, around that time, described it as Cadillac\\u2019s \\u201cone chance,\\u201d saying the Detroit automaker would \\u201cleave nothing on the table.\\u201d Cadillac has largely been able to get its house in order with most of those objectives, according to executives, auto analysts and industry metrics. \\u201cRight now, I think they\\u2019re in really good shape.\\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \\u201cThey have been more consistent with how to handle the Cadillac brand, and that\\u2019s going to continue to be incredibly important \\u2026 consistency over time is one of the most important things you can do.\\u201d Cadillac decided to focus its future products to be all-electric vehicles, in a bid to compete with Tesla\\u2019s pricey Model Y and Model X at the time. The plan was for Cadillac EVs to eventually take the place of gas-powered models as soon as 2030, but now it\\u2019ll offer a full lineup of EVs as well as gas-powered vehicles. The first product released under the new strategy was the all-electric Lyriq that went on sale in 2022, but the pinnacle of the plan is the bespoke, $300,000 Celestiq that the brand is currently \\u201crelaunching.\\u201d The 2018 showing at the design dome \\u2014 hallowed ground for the automaker \\u2014 was crucial to sell the current vision of Cadillac, according to Simcoe, Carlisle and others involved. \\u201cIn the dome, there was a vision for Celestiq and the Cadillac requirements,\\u201d Simcoe told CNBC from his corner design office overlooking the dome. \\u201cIt was basically all the things that would define the brand. \\u201cThere was a vision for the customers we\\u2019re addressing. There was a vision for the portfolio we needed. There was a vision for pretty much everything inside the business,\\u201d Simcoe said. The dome show took place after the exodus of Cadillac\\u2019s last president, Johan de Nysschen (all other Cadillac leaders since have been vice presidents), who had discussed the need for the brand to have its own vehicle platforms and powertrains. De Nysschen, an auto industry veteran who\\u2019s also led Audi and Infiniti, said he believes Cadillac \\u201chas made a lot of progress\\u201d since his departure. \\u201cI am pleased to say, in broad terms, that they\\u2019ve stayed true to the strategic direction that we had been agreed upon with GM top management,\\u201d he said during a phone interview. GM\\u2019s rule of thumb has been to prioritize \\u201cvolume over value,\\u201d which includes achieving scale on mainstream models ahead of producing luxury vehicles such as Cadillacs. The strategy has helped GM\\u2019s profits but it\\u2019s been a challenge for Cadillac at times. It\\u2019s caused the brand to be late to vehicle segments and resulted in products such as the short-lived Cadillac ELR (a version of the Chevrolet Volt) a decade ago and, more recently, the outgoing XT6 crossover. That is no longer the case for Cadillac as it\\u2019s refocused, officials said. For example, there were expectations that GM would do a Cadillac version of the mid-engine Corvette, but Reuss said such a vehicle would not have fit into the brand\\u2019s new strategy, noting it would have shared a majority of components with the Corvette. \\u201cIt was developed as a secondary car to the Corvette, on purpose. We would never do that,\\u201d Reuss said, citing potential room for additional specialty, Cadillac-specific vehicles outside of its $300,000-plus Celestiq. The all-electric Celestiq is a bespoke vehicle that the company is hand building at its tech and design campus in Warren. It was always meant to be low-volume production but orders as of the end of last year were only in the dozens. After delayed starts to production and sales, Reuss said GM is essentially relaunching the car after the automaker has gotten its software \\u2014 a crucial part of the business \\u2014 in order. \\u201cJust to be really transparent, we struggled launching our regular EVs, and so we\\u2019ve built our software capability to really execute and execute on time,\\u201d Reuss said. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want to execute the car without everything being perfect on the software front. \\u2026 To be honest, we\\u2019re relaunching the car.\\u201d First customer deliveries of the Celestiq are expected by midyear, according to the company, which declined to disclose how many orders it has received for the car. If successful, it could create a new two-unit business model for the company: one focused on hand-built, high-end vehicles and the other on mass-produced models. Wall Street is starting to once again take notice of Cadillac inside GM\\u2019s business, as other growth opportunities have faltered. \\u201cOne of the real gems is Cadillac that we don\\u2019t think gets enough airtime and there\\u2019s huge opportunity,\\u201d BofA analyst John Murphy said at an investor conference last month with Cadillac\\u2019s current leader, John Roth. The decade-long plan for Cadillac also has the brand\\u2019s momentum building, particularly in North America \\u2014 its home market. During the first quarter of this year, Cadillac reported an 18% increase in sales, including its best retail performance since 2008, Roth said. It hit that while offering among the lowest incentives as a percentage of sales price on record average transaction prices of $77,900. \\u201cThat\\u2019s building brand health. That\\u2019s building brand value,\\u201d Roth, Cadillac global vice president, said at the BofA conference. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a growth brand.\\u201d April sales were the brand\\u2019s best for that month since 2007, GM CEO Mary Barra said on a call Thursday. She noted all of its U.S. vehicles are produced in America \\u2014 a potential advantage over German luxury brands and others. \\u201cSo there is a huge opportunity for us to continue to build and leverage our product strength and the fact that these vehicles are built in the U.S.,\\u201d Barra said. Reuss declined to comment on potential impacts to Cadillac as a result of tariffs, but said the American brand is well positioned to continue to grow. While Cadillac grows domestically, Cadillac\\u2019s sales in China \\u2014 its largest market for years until 2024 \\u2014 have been in free fall. It\\u2019s an industrywide problem, as Chinese brands grow in the country, dominating Western brands such as Cadillac, BMW and others. \\u201cChina is difficult for everyone. How Cadillac addresses that and improves that is not entirely in their control,\\u201d Brinley said. \\u201cTheir products are strong, but I think the dynamics in China are just not in an imported brand\\u2019s favor right now.\\u201d Cadillac\\u2019s sales in China peaked at nearly 232,000 vehicles in 2021, representing 62% of Cadillac\\u2019s global sales. In 2024, Chinese sales totaled roughly 110,400 units, or 38%, of its 294,200 sales globally \\u2014 marking the first time since 2015 that they\\u2019ve dropped below 300,000. Reuss, GM\\u2019s president, said China remains a focus for the automaker, which also is attempting to return to Europe with Cadillac. GM exited the market after selling its European operations in 2017. Reuss declined to discuss sales targets for Cadillac, but said both China and Europe continue to have a \\u201cmajor role\\u201d to play for the brand\\u2019 renaissance. \\u201cI think the way we execute vehicles globally will change, but Cadillac will be there with the latest and greatest, and we need to rebuild the sales capability, which we\\u2019re doing,\\u201d Reuss said. Cadillac last year remained off the winner\\u2019s podium in terms of sales. It was fifth in the U.S. and seventh globally, according to industry data confirmed by Cadillac. It trailed global leader BMW as well as Mercedes-Benz and Audi, among others. Roth last month said the brand\\u2019s success includes sales, but Cadillac\\u2019s goals are multifaceted and the race to profitably grow Cadillac continues. \\u201cWe talk about Cadillac being the \\u2018standard of the world,\\u2019\\u201d Roth told investors last month. \\u201cEvery day that standard never has a finish line. We keep moving that finish line, keep raising the bar on what the brand needs to stand for in the marketplace and keep growing and evolving the brand on a forward-looking basis.\\u201d\",\n          \"Kohl\\u2019s CEO Ashley Buchanan was fired this week because he had an undisclosed personal relationship with a vendor on a consulting team that made a multimillion-dollar deal with the retailer at his direction, the company said in a regulatory filing. Buchanan had only been in the role since January. An investigation by an outside law firm found Buchanan had violated company policies by directing the company to enter into \\u201cvendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest,\\u201d the department store said. The Kohl\\u2019s board of directors terminated Buchanan for cause, the company said, and appointed board director Michael Bender as the interim CEO. Kohl\\u2019s said Buchanan\\u2019s firing was unrelated to the company\\u2019s performance and did not involve any other employees. Buchanan previously held the same position at the crafts retailer Michaels since 2020. He became Kohl\\u2019s chief executive in January. Kohl\\u2019s said Wednesday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the investigation found Buchanan had directed the company to \\u201cconduct business with a vendor founded by an individual with whom Mr. Buchanan has a personal relationship on highly unusual terms favorable to the vendor.\\u201d The filing said the unnamed person was also part of a consulting team that had entered into a multimillion-dollar agreement with Kohl\\u2019s under Buchanan\\u2019s direction. The regulatory filing said Buchanan did not disclose the relationship as required under company policy, and he will have to forfeit all equity awards and bonuses he received from Kohl\\u2019s when he was hired. He also will have to reimburse the company on a pro-rated basis for a $2.5 million signing bonus. Kohl\\u2019s did not disclose who the consulting agreement was with, but The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report Buchanan had been fired, said it was Boston Consulting Group, where Buchanan\\u2019s romantic partner, Chandra Holt, was an adviser. The Journal report cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. Buchanan and Holt did not immediately reply to requests for comment made by phone and email. Boston Consulting Group said in a statement to NBC News that it was \\u201cshocked to learn of the relationship between\\u201d Holt and Buchanan. \\u201cWe have strict guidelines for our senior advisors to disclose any conflicts of interest,\\u201d Boston Consulting said, adding it had terminated Holt\\u2019s contract for nondisclosure. The Boston Consulting Group said Holt is a recognized industry expert who worked for the group on a part time basis and was paid by the hour. \\u201cShe was not involved in structuring the project or negotiating any contract terms and was not expected to lead any part of the project,\\u201d the group said.

Researcher\",\n          \"Chinese bargain retailer Temu changed its business model in the U.S. as the Trump administration\\u2019s new rules on low-value shipments took effect Friday. In recent days, Temu has abruptly shifted its website and app to only display listings for products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses. Items shipped directly from China, which previously blanketed the site, are now labeled as out of stock. Temu made a name for itself in the U.S. as a destination for ultra-discounted items shipped direct from China, such as $5 sneakers and $1.50 garlic presses. It\\u2019s been able to keep prices low because of the so-called de minimis rule, which has allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free since 2016. The loophole expired Friday at 12:01 a.m. EDT as a result of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in April. Trump briefly suspended the de minimis rule in February before reinstating the provision days later as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a mountain of low-value packages. The end of de minimis, as well as Trump\\u2019s new 145% tariffs on China, has forced Temu to raise prices, suspend its aggressive online advertising push and now alter the selection of goods available to American shoppers to circumvent higher levies. A Temu spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that all sales in the U.S. are now handled by local sellers and said they are fulfilled \\u201cfrom within the country.\\u201d Temu said pricing for U.S. shoppers \\u201cremains unchanged.\\u201d \\u201cTemu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform,\\u201d the spokesperson said. \\u201cThe move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.\\u201d Before the change, shoppers who attempted to purchase Temu products shipped from China were confronted with \\u201cimport charges\\u201d of between 130% and 150%. The fees often cost more than the individual item and more than doubled the price of many orders. Temu advertises that local products have \\u201cno import charges\\u201d and \\u201cno extra charges upon delivery.\\u201d The company, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has gradually built up its inventory in the U.S. over the past year in anticipation of escalating trade tensions and the removal of de minimis. Shein, which has also benefited from the loophole, moved to raise prices last week. The fast-fashion retailer added a banner at checkout that says, \\u201cTariffs are included in the price you pay. You\\u2019ll never have to pay extra at delivery.\\u201d Many third-party sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese manufacturers to source or assemble their products. The company\\u2019s Temu competitor, called Amazon Haul, has relied on de minimis to ship products priced at $20 or less directly from China to the U.S. Amazon said Tuesday following a dustup with the White House that had it considered showing tariff-related costs on Haul products ahead of the de minimis cutoff but that it has since scrapped those plans. Prior to Trump\\u2019s second term in office, the Biden administration had also looked to curtail the provision. Critics of the de minimis provision argue that it harms American businesses and that it facilitates shipments of fentanyl and other illicit substances because, they say, the packages are less likely to be inspected by customs agents.

Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wouldn't support Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, likely blocking the path to confirmation for the \\u201cStop the Steal\\u201d organizer who had closely aligned himself with Jan. 6 defendants. \\u201cI\\u2019ve indicated to the White House I wouldn\\u2019t support his nomination,\\u201d Tillis said Tuesday after meeting with Martin on Monday night. Tillis is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing Martin's nomination. The panel has 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, meaning if all other members aside from Tillis voted along party lines, the vote on Martin would end in a tie and his nomination would not be reported favorably to the full Senate. Trump's nomination of Martin, a longtime right-wing activist who had no prosecutorial experience until Trump named him as interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on the day of his inauguration, has raised major concerns with alumni of the office, which prosecutors both federal and local crimes in Washington. Tillis said his concerns about Martin\\u2019s involvement in the defense of people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were too much to overcome, but said that Martin agreed with him that there were hundreds of individuals who shouldn't have been included in Trump's mass pardons. \\u201cMr. Martin did a good job of explaining the one area that I think he\\u2019s probably right, that there were some people that were over prosecuted, but there were some, 2 or 300 of them that should have never gotten a pardon. And he agreed with that, but the disagreement there had more to do,\\\" Tillis said. \\\"If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. Attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protest happened, I\\u2019d probably support him, but not in this district.\\u201d Martin opened up an investigation into the office's handling of Jan. 6 cases, and several federal prosecutors who worked on Capitol attack cases were fired during his tenure, while Martin demoted others. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney is set to expire on May 20. In a speech at the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, Martin called on \\u201cdie-hard true Americans\\u201d to work until their \\u201clast breath\\u201d to \\u201cstop the steal.\\u201d Martin's association with a far-right Jan. 6 rioter who had posed in a Adolph Hitler mustache and who the Justice Department previously called an \\u201can avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer\\\" also raised concerns during his nomination process, and Martin sought to distance himself from the defendant. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday that he wants \\\"to put people on the agenda when he \\\"can help the president be successful in his nominees and and that\\u2019s all I can say at this point.\\\" Trump had pushed senators to support Martin as recently as Monday night, writing in a post on Truth Social that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., believed Martin's confirmation was \\\"IMPERATIVE in terms of doing all that has to be done to SAVE LIVES and to, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN.\\\" Ryan J.

The CIA hired Dr. Terry Adirim, director of the CIA\\u2019s Center for Global Health Services, after she served as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Just days after Adirim started her job at the CIA last year, far-right commentator Ivan Raiklin accused her of being the \\u201carchitect\\u201d of the Defense Department\\u2019s vaccine mandate, which required members of the military to get the Covid-19 vaccine. The lawsuit alleges that Adirim\\u2019s hiring at the CIA had not yet been announced publicly and that someone inside the government leaked the information to Raiklin. Raiklin, a former Green Beret who has called himself the \\u201csecretary of retribution,\\u201d has been an intense critic of the Covid-19 vaccines, calling them \\u201cDNA-mutilation injections.\\u201d He has demanded retaliation against Pentagon officials who he says were involved in requiring service members to get the Covid-19 vaccines. Raiklin is associated with Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump\\u2019s national security adviser at the start of his first term. The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adirim was fired only weeks after she received an email from the CIA\\u2019s chief operating officer saying the CIA \\u201clooked forward to investing in her career,\\u201d according to the lawsuit. That was also two days after Lara Loomer, another far-right conspiracy theorist, paid a visit to the White House and urged that several national security officials be dismissed for alleged disloyalty, according to the lawsuit. Loomer later took credit for the abrupt firing of the director of the National Security Agency, four-star Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, as well as its civilian deputy. \\u201cWe\\u2019re suing CIA to enjoin the Agency from firing Dr. Adirim, and seeking damages for violating her privacy, ignoring her due process rights, and breaching her employment contract,\\u201d Adirim\\u2019s lawyer, Kevin Carroll, said in a statement. Carroll says in the lawsuit that he will seek to prove through discovery that Raiklin worked with Loomer to secure Adirim\\u2019s dismissal.

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump\\u2019s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The award recognizes Pence \\u201cfor putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,\\u201d the JFK Library Foundation said. \\u201cTo forge a future together, we have to find common ground,\\u201d Pence said. \\u201cI hope in some small way my presence here tonight is a reminder that whatever differences we may have as Americans, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand. It\\u2019s what binds us across time and generations. .... It\\u2019s what makes us one people.\\u201d His comments came hours after an interview with Trump aired in which he was asked whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Trump was noncommittal. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m not, I\\u2019m not a lawyer. I don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Trump said when pressed in an interview with NBC\\u2019s Kristen Welker. It was taped Friday at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida and aired Sunday. Pence never mentioned Trump during his 10-minute speech but made several references to the Trump administration. Referencing what he called \\u201cthese divided times, in these anxious days,\\u201d he acknowledged that he probably had differences with the Democrats in the room but also with his own Republican Party \\u201con spending, tariffs and my belief that America is the leader of the free world and must stand with Ukraine until the Russian invasion is repelled and a just and lasting peace is secured.\\u201d Trump pressured Pence to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president falsely claimed the vote was marred by fraud. Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority. When a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to \\u201chang Mike Pence.\\u201d Pence was whisked away by Secret Service agents, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the rioters. \\u201cMike Pence didn\\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,\\u201d Trump wrote at the time on X, formerly Twitter, as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building. Pence rejected the Secret Service\\u2019s advice that he leave the Capitol, staying to continue the ceremonial election certification of Democrat Joe Biden\\u2019s presidential victory once rioters were cleared. In describing his role, Pence told the audience that \\u201cby God\\u2019s grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America.\\u201d \\u201cJan. 6 was a tragic day but it became a triumph of freedom. History will record that our institutions held,\\u201d he said in his speech. \\u201cLeaders in both chambers, in both political parties reconvened the very same day and finished democracy\\u2019s work under the Constitution.\\u201d JFK\\u2019s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, who along with his grandson Jack Schlossberg presented the award, said Pence\\u2019s actions that day were a reminder that democracy must not be taken for granted. \\u201cAt the time I thought Vice President Pence was just doing his job,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOnly later did I realize that his act of courage saved our government and warned us about what could happen and is happening right now.\\u201d The Profile in Courage Award, named for a book Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president, honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences. Previous recipients of the award include former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford. Pence has emerged as one of the few Republicans willing to take on the Trump administration. His political action group, Advancing American Freedom, campaigned against the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation\\u2019s health agencies. He\\u2019s delivered speeches urging the president to stand with longtime foreign allies and posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, \\u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\\u201d The Associated Press\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wouldn't support Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, likely blocking the path to confirmation for the \\u201cStop the Steal\\u201d organizer who had closely aligned himself with Jan. 6 defendants. \\u201cI\\u2019ve indicated to the White House I wouldn\\u2019t support his nomination,\\u201d Tillis said Tuesday after meeting with Martin on Monday night. Tillis is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing Martin's nomination. The panel has 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, meaning if all other members aside from Tillis voted along party lines, the vote on Martin would end in a tie and his nomination would not be reported favorably to the full Senate. Trump's nomination of Martin, a longtime right-wing activist who had no prosecutorial experience until Trump named him as interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on the day of his inauguration, has raised major concerns with alumni of the office, which prosecutors both federal and local crimes in Washington. Tillis said his concerns about Martin\\u2019s involvement in the defense of people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were too much to overcome, but said that Martin agreed with him that there were hundreds of individuals who shouldn't have been included in Trump's mass pardons. \\u201cMr. Martin did a good job of explaining the one area that I think he\\u2019s probably right, that there were some people that were over prosecuted, but there were some, 2 or 300 of them that should have never gotten a pardon. And he agreed with that, but the disagreement there had more to do,\\\" Tillis said. \\\"If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. Attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protest happened, I\\u2019d probably support him, but not in this district.\\u201d Martin opened up an investigation into the office's handling of Jan. 6 cases, and several federal prosecutors who worked on Capitol attack cases were fired during his tenure, while Martin demoted others. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney is set to expire on May 20. In a speech at the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, Martin called on \\u201cdie-hard true Americans\\u201d to work until their \\u201clast breath\\u201d to \\u201cstop the steal.\\u201d Martin's association with a far-right Jan. 6 rioter who had posed in a Adolph Hitler mustache and who the Justice Department previously called an \\u201can avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer\\\" also raised concerns during his nomination process, and Martin sought to distance himself from the defendant. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday that he wants \\\"to put people on the agenda when he \\\"can help the president be successful in his nominees and and that\\u2019s all I can say at this point.\\\" Trump had pushed senators to support Martin as recently as Monday night, writing in a post on Truth Social that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., believed Martin's confirmation was \\\"IMPERATIVE in terms of doing all that has to be done to SAVE LIVES and to, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN.\\\" Ryan J.

The CIA hired Dr. Terry Adirim, director of the CIA\\u2019s Center for Global Health Services, after she served as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Just days after Adirim started her job at the CIA last year, far-right commentator Ivan Raiklin accused her of being the \\u201carchitect\\u201d of the Defense Department\\u2019s vaccine mandate, which required members of the military to get the Covid-19 vaccine. The lawsuit alleges that Adirim\\u2019s hiring at the CIA had not yet been announced publicly and that someone inside the government leaked the information to Raiklin. Raiklin, a former Green Beret who has called himself the \\u201csecretary of retribution,\\u201d has been an intense critic of the Covid-19 vaccines, calling them \\u201cDNA-mutilation injections.\\u201d He has demanded retaliation against Pentagon officials who he says were involved in requiring service members to get the Covid-19 vaccines. Raiklin is associated with Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump\\u2019s national security adviser at the start of his first term. The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adirim was fired only weeks after she received an email from the CIA\\u2019s chief operating officer saying the CIA \\u201clooked forward to investing in her career,\\u201d according to the lawsuit. That was also two days after Lara Loomer, another far-right conspiracy theorist, paid a visit to the White House and urged that several national security officials be dismissed for alleged disloyalty, according to the lawsuit. Loomer later took credit for the abrupt firing of the director of the National Security Agency, four-star Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, as well as its civilian deputy. \\u201cWe\\u2019re suing CIA to enjoin the Agency from firing Dr. Adirim, and seeking damages for violating her privacy, ignoring her due process rights, and breaching her employment contract,\\u201d Adirim\\u2019s lawyer, Kevin Carroll, said in a statement. Carroll says in the lawsuit that he will seek to prove through discovery that Raiklin worked with Loomer to secure Adirim\\u2019s dismissal.

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump\\u2019s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The award recognizes Pence \\u201cfor putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,\\u201d the JFK Library Foundation said. \\u201cTo forge a future together, we have to find common ground,\\u201d Pence said. \\u201cI hope in some small way my presence here tonight is a reminder that whatever differences we may have as Americans, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand. It\\u2019s what binds us across time and generations. .... It\\u2019s what makes us one people.\\u201d His comments came hours after an interview with Trump aired in which he was asked whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Trump was noncommittal. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m not, I\\u2019m not a lawyer. I don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Trump said when pressed in an interview with NBC\\u2019s Kristen Welker. It was taped Friday at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida and aired Sunday. Pence never mentioned Trump during his 10-minute speech but made several references to the Trump administration. Referencing what he called \\u201cthese divided times, in these anxious days,\\u201d he acknowledged that he probably had differences with the Democrats in the room but also with his own Republican Party \\u201con spending, tariffs and my belief that America is the leader of the free world and must stand with Ukraine until the Russian invasion is repelled and a just and lasting peace is secured.\\u201d Trump pressured Pence to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president falsely claimed the vote was marred by fraud. Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority. When a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to \\u201chang Mike Pence.\\u201d Pence was whisked away by Secret Service agents, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the rioters. \\u201cMike Pence didn\\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,\\u201d Trump wrote at the time on X, formerly Twitter, as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building. Pence rejected the Secret Service\\u2019s advice that he leave the Capitol, staying to continue the ceremonial election certification of Democrat Joe Biden\\u2019s presidential victory once rioters were cleared. In describing his role, Pence told the audience that \\u201cby God\\u2019s grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America.\\u201d \\u201cJan. 6 was a tragic day but it became a triumph of freedom. History will record that our institutions held,\\u201d he said in his speech. \\u201cLeaders in both chambers, in both political parties reconvened the very same day and finished democracy\\u2019s work under the Constitution.\\u201d JFK\\u2019s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, who along with his grandson Jack Schlossberg presented the award, said Pence\\u2019s actions that day were a reminder that democracy must not be taken for granted. \\u201cAt the time I thought Vice President Pence was just doing his job,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOnly later did I realize that his act of courage saved our government and warned us about what could happen and is happening right now.\\u201d The Profile in Courage Award, named for a book Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president, honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences. Previous recipients of the award include former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford. Pence has emerged as one of the few Republicans willing to take on the Trump administration. His political action group, Advancing American Freedom, campaigned against the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation\\u2019s health agencies. He\\u2019s delivered speeches urging the president to stand with longtime foreign allies and posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, \\u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\\u201d The Associated Press\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Unidentified people were \\u201cvirtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks\\u201d using improvised explosive devices, the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police said. The perpetrators planned to gain notoriety on social networks through the bombing, authorities said. The person accused of being responsible for the plan is in custody, and a teenager has been detained in connection with the matter, police said. Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security alleged in a statement that the plot was organized by a larger extremist network that operates online to radicalize adolescents and provoke hate crimes. It's unclear when authorities found out about the threat. The civil police intelligence unit was first alerted to the scheme, and search and seizure warrants were obtained for multiple areas in Brazil, police said. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said her team learned about the alleged threat through media reports Sunday morning. \\u201cPrior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\\u201d the spokesperson said. \\u201cHer team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\\u201d Lady Gaga singer posted about the show on her Instagram account Sunday, praising the crowd for their vibrancy throughout it. \\\"I wish I could share this feeling with the whole world\\u2014I know I can\\u2019t, but I can say this\\u2014if you lose your way, you can find your way back if you believe in yourself and work hard,\\\" Gaga wrote. She did not address the alleged bombing threat. Lady Gaga played at the famed Copacabana venue as part of her new \\u201cMayhem\\u201d tour. She announced the show in February on Instagram, saying she was excited to return after having had to cancel her last show in Brazil because of a hip injury during her \\u201cBorn This Way Ball\\u201d tour. She added that she was \\u201cdying to come perform\\u201d for her Brazilian \\u201clittle monsters,\\u201d which is the nickname for Lady Gaga fans. The free concert Saturday was attended by 2.5 million people, according to concert organizers. It is the largest attendance for a female artist, the organizers said, beating Madonna's draw of 1.6 million people at the Copacabana Beach last year. It falls shy of the Guinness World Record for the largest free concert, which was also at the beach venue. Rod Stewart's performance at the Copacabana in 1994 for New Year's Eve brought in an estimated 3.5 million revelers. Rio\\u2019s security plan included 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers and 400 military firefighters. The show was supported by the local government in hope of boosting economic activity between big events in Rio, such as Carnival and next month's Saint John\\u2019s Day celebrations. More than 500,000 tourists flocked to the city to see Lady Gaga, Rio\\u2019s City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Taylor Swift was forced to cancel her shows in Vienna because of a security threat less than a year ago. Austrian authorities said they were alerted to plans to bomb Swift's Eras Tour performances in the city in a terrorism-related attack. Swift opted to cancel the concerts and waited until the end of her European leg of the tour. \\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\\u201d Swift said weeks later. \\u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\\u201d Swift had expressed anxiety about keeping people safe during her live performances, citing the 2017 bombing at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester, England, and the 2017 music festival shooting in Las Vegas.

Inductees were announced during the April 27 episode of \\u201cAmerican Idol,\\u201d with Cyndi Lauper, Outkast, Soundgarden and Chubby Checker among the seven acts who will be enshrined in the performer category. Salt-N-Pepa will enter with the musical influence award, which recognized artists who have impacted culture through their music and performance style. The pair joins Outkast to make it the sixth consecutive year at least one rap act will be inducted. 2025 also marks the fourth straight year four or more women will be inducted. While the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame prepares to welcome a new class of talent, several notable nominees, which were announced in February, did not make the final list of inductees. Oasis and Mariah Carey both failed to get inducted for the second straight year. The Black Crowes, Billy Idol and Phish, which notably won the fan vote, also didn\\u2019t make the cut. The inductees are determined by an international voting panel made up of more than 1,200 \\u201cartists, historians, and music industry professionals,\\u201d the Hall of Fame said in a press release announcing the 2025 nominees. \\u201cThe selection criteria include an artist\\u2019s impact on music culture, influence on other musicians that have followed, as well as the scope and longevity of their career and body of work,\\u201d the release stated. But some fans on social media couldn\\u2019t believe the high-profile performers did not get inducted. \\u201cI love you @MariahCarey and you don\\u2019t need a Rock n Roll induction to validate what you\\u2019ve meant to the music industry over the last 35 years and the numerous lives you\\u2019ve impacted!\\u201d one fan wrote. \\u201cYou are ONE OF ONE and don\\u2019t ever forget that!\\u201d \\u201cBlows my mind that Billy Idol is not on this list,\\u201d one person commented. \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing the winner of the fan vote. @phish. What\\u2019s the point of having people vote if it doesn\\u2019t mean anything?\\u201d asked another X user. Phish came in first in the fan vote, followed by Bad Company and Billy Idol, per Variety. \\u201cThe top five vote-getters in the public fan poll form one ballot, which is weighted the same as the rest of the submitted ballots,\\u201d according to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony will stream live Nov. 8 from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Disney+ and on Hulu the next day. An induction special will also air at a later date on ABC. Here\\u2019s a look at all the inductees across the various categories:\",\n          \"PARIS \\u2014 A key defendant in the trial of a group accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 and stealing $9 million worth of jewelry, has said he has come to regret the trauma he caused the reality star-turned-business mogul in the years since. Yunice Abbas, perhaps the best-known defendant in the trial, said that despite a yearslong criminal history, this was the first time he had truly come to recognize the \\u201ctrauma\\u201d he had caused his victim. \\u201cI regret it, not because I got caught, but because ... there was a trauma,\\u201d Abbas, 72, said before a jury Tuesday as proceedings against the 10 people charged in connection with the 2016 robbery resumed after launching Monday afternoon. The first of several defendants set to testify in the trial, Abbas had previously confessed to his role in the heist, detailing the robbery in his 2021 book, \\u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.\\u201d The matter of the book came up during the testimony, with Abbas saying that he was not responsible for the title and that he disputes his alleged role in the heist. He added that he was not involved in tying up Kardashian, who was staying in Paris for the city's Fashion Week, instead staying downstairs to keep watch. Abbas and nine others, dubbed the \\u201cgrandpa robbers\\u201d in local media because of their ages \\u2014 some of the accused are in their 70s and 80s \\u2014 are alleged to have played a range of roles in the heist including holding Kardashian, 44, at gunpoint and being complicit in that crime. During questioning, Abbas described his criminal past \\u2014 he has spent a total of almost 20 years in jail for various crimes \\u2014 including the armed robbery of a bank in Belgium. He said that as a young man, he was fiercely opposed to theft but that he had turned to a life of crime because of the bad influence of friends and money difficulties, in the hope it would prove an easier path. Abbas said his family had suffered because of his crimes, adding that he had \\u201cnever had a role model\\u201d himself and he had done what he thought was needed to try to provide for his children. He spoke rapidly during his testimony, his arm shaking throughout, possibly because he has Parkinson's disease. At one point, the shaking was violent enough for him to hold one hand in the other. In the years since the 2016 robbery targeting Kardashian, Abbas said he now felt \\u201cvery uneasy\\u201d with what happened that day. But, he said, \\u201cI can\\u2019t do anything besides apologize.\\u201d Kardashian had been staying at a private apartment complex in the French capital when five of the accused are alleged to have gained entry into the building and robbed her at gunpoint, taking items including her engagement ring from her then-husband Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The five other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs on Kardashian's whereabouts. In the years since, one defendant has died, while the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants due to medical issues. In addition to Abbas, those standing trial will include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \\u201cOld Omar,\\u201d who is alleged to have masterminded the robbery; his son, Harminy, 37, accused of being the getaway driver; Didier \\u201cBlue Eyes\\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, who is accused of tipping the others off on Kardashian's whereabouts. Christiane Glotin, 78, is also among the accused, with authorities alleging she was an accomplice in the heist. At least four defendants were expected to be questioned in court Tuesday. Kardashian herself is expected to appear in court May 13. The reality star and businesswoman has previously detailed her experience during the robbery, at one point tearing up in an interview with David Letterman as she described how she feared she would be sexually assaulted and possibly killed during the attack. \\u201cI was like, \\u2018OK, this is the time I\\u2019m going to get raped ... just prepare yourself,\\u201d she said in the interview, wiping away tears, later describing how she feared her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, would find her dead. \\u201cI just kept on thinking about Kourtney,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to be traumatized for the rest of her life if she sees me.\\u201d Gabrielle Nolin reported from Paris and Chantal Da Silva from London.

Unidentified people were \\u201cvirtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks\\u201d using improvised explosive devices, the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police said. The perpetrators planned to gain notoriety on social networks through the bombing, authorities said. The person accused of being responsible for the plan is in custody, and a teenager has been detained in connection with the matter, police said. Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security alleged in a statement that the plot was organized by a larger extremist network that operates online to radicalize adolescents and provoke hate crimes. It's unclear when authorities found out about the threat. The civil police intelligence unit was first alerted to the scheme, and search and seizure warrants were obtained for multiple areas in Brazil, police said. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said her team learned about the alleged threat through media reports Sunday morning. \\u201cPrior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\\u201d the spokesperson said. \\u201cHer team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\\u201d Lady Gaga singer posted about the show on her Instagram account Sunday, praising the crowd for their vibrancy throughout it. \\\"I wish I could share this feeling with the whole world\\u2014I know I can\\u2019t, but I can say this\\u2014if you lose your way, you can find your way back if you believe in yourself and work hard,\\\" Gaga wrote. She did not address the alleged bombing threat. Lady Gaga played at the famed Copacabana venue as part of her new \\u201cMayhem\\u201d tour. She announced the show in February on Instagram, saying she was excited to return after having had to cancel her last show in Brazil because of a hip injury during her \\u201cBorn This Way Ball\\u201d tour. She added that she was \\u201cdying to come perform\\u201d for her Brazilian \\u201clittle monsters,\\u201d which is the nickname for Lady Gaga fans. The free concert Saturday was attended by 2.5 million people, according to concert organizers. It is the largest attendance for a female artist, the organizers said, beating Madonna's draw of 1.6 million people at the Copacabana Beach last year. It falls shy of the Guinness World Record for the largest free concert, which was also at the beach venue. Rod Stewart's performance at the Copacabana in 1994 for New Year's Eve brought in an estimated 3.5 million revelers. Rio\\u2019s security plan included 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers and 400 military firefighters. The show was supported by the local government in hope of boosting economic activity between big events in Rio, such as Carnival and next month's Saint John\\u2019s Day celebrations. More than 500,000 tourists flocked to the city to see Lady Gaga, Rio\\u2019s City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Taylor Swift was forced to cancel her shows in Vienna because of a security threat less than a year ago. Austrian authorities said they were alerted to plans to bomb Swift's Eras Tour performances in the city in a terrorism-related attack. Swift opted to cancel the concerts and waited until the end of her European leg of the tour. \\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\\u201d Swift said weeks later. \\u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\\u201d Swift had expressed anxiety about keeping people safe during her live performances, citing the 2017 bombing at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester, England, and the 2017 music festival shooting in Las Vegas.

Inductees were announced during the April 27 episode of \\u201cAmerican Idol,\\u201d with Cyndi Lauper, Outkast, Soundgarden and Chubby Checker among the seven acts who will be enshrined in the performer category. Salt-N-Pepa will enter with the musical influence award, which recognized artists who have impacted culture through their music and performance style. The pair joins Outkast to make it the sixth consecutive year at least one rap act will be inducted. 2025 also marks the fourth straight year four or more women will be inducted. While the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame prepares to welcome a new class of talent, several notable nominees, which were announced in February, did not make the final list of inductees. Oasis and Mariah Carey both failed to get inducted for the second straight year. The Black Crowes, Billy Idol and Phish, which notably won the fan vote, also didn\\u2019t make the cut. The inductees are determined by an international voting panel made up of more than 1,200 \\u201cartists, historians, and music industry professionals,\\u201d the Hall of Fame said in a press release announcing the 2025 nominees. \\u201cThe selection criteria include an artist\\u2019s impact on music culture, influence on other musicians that have followed, as well as the scope and longevity of their career and body of work,\\u201d the release stated. But some fans on social media couldn\\u2019t believe the high-profile performers did not get inducted. \\u201cI love you @MariahCarey and you don\\u2019t need a Rock n Roll induction to validate what you\\u2019ve meant to the music industry over the last 35 years and the numerous lives you\\u2019ve impacted!\\u201d one fan wrote. \\u201cYou are ONE OF ONE and don\\u2019t ever forget that!\\u201d \\u201cBlows my mind that Billy Idol is not on this list,\\u201d one person commented. \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing the winner of the fan vote. @phish. What\\u2019s the point of having people vote if it doesn\\u2019t mean anything?\\u201d asked another X user. Phish came in first in the fan vote, followed by Bad Company and Billy Idol, per Variety. \\u201cThe top five vote-getters in the public fan poll form one ballot, which is weighted the same as the rest of the submitted ballots,\\u201d according to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony will stream live Nov. 8 from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Disney+ and on Hulu the next day. An induction special will also air at a later date on ABC. Here\\u2019s a look at all the inductees across the various categories:\",\n          \"PARIS \\u2014 A key defendant in the trial of a group accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 and stealing $9 million worth of jewelry, has said he has come to regret the trauma he caused the reality star-turned-business mogul in the years since. Yunice Abbas, perhaps the best-known defendant in the trial, said that despite a yearslong criminal history, this was the first time he had truly come to recognize the \\u201ctrauma\\u201d he had caused his victim. \\u201cI regret it, not because I got caught, but because ... there was a trauma,\\u201d Abbas, 72, said before a jury Tuesday as proceedings against the 10 people charged in connection with the 2016 robbery resumed after launching Monday afternoon. The first of several defendants set to testify in the trial, Abbas had previously confessed to his role in the heist, detailing the robbery in his 2021 book, \\u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.\\u201d The matter of the book came up during the testimony, with Abbas saying that he was not responsible for the title and that he disputes his alleged role in the heist. He added that he was not involved in tying up Kardashian, who was staying in Paris for the city's Fashion Week, instead staying downstairs to keep watch. Abbas and nine others, dubbed the \\u201cgrandpa robbers\\u201d in local media because of their ages \\u2014 some of the accused are in their 70s and 80s \\u2014 are alleged to have played a range of roles in the heist including holding Kardashian, 44, at gunpoint and being complicit in that crime. During questioning, Abbas described his criminal past \\u2014 he has spent a total of almost 20 years in jail for various crimes \\u2014 including the armed robbery of a bank in Belgium. He said that as a young man, he was fiercely opposed to theft but that he had turned to a life of crime because of the bad influence of friends and money difficulties, in the hope it would prove an easier path. Abbas said his family had suffered because of his crimes, adding that he had \\u201cnever had a role model\\u201d himself and he had done what he thought was needed to try to provide for his children. He spoke rapidly during his testimony, his arm shaking throughout, possibly because he has Parkinson's disease. At one point, the shaking was violent enough for him to hold one hand in the other. In the years since the 2016 robbery targeting Kardashian, Abbas said he now felt \\u201cvery uneasy\\u201d with what happened that day. But, he said, \\u201cI can\\u2019t do anything besides apologize.\\u201d Kardashian had been staying at a private apartment complex in the French capital when five of the accused are alleged to have gained entry into the building and robbed her at gunpoint, taking items including her engagement ring from her then-husband Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The five other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs on Kardashian's whereabouts. In the years since, one defendant has died, while the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants due to medical issues. In addition to Abbas, those standing trial will include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \\u201cOld Omar,\\u201d who is alleged to have masterminded the robbery; his son, Harminy, 37, accused of being the getaway driver; Didier \\u201cBlue Eyes\\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, who is accused of tipping the others off on Kardashian's whereabouts. Christiane Glotin, 78, is also among the accused, with authorities alleging she was an accomplice in the heist. At least four defendants were expected to be questioned in court Tuesday. Kardashian herself is expected to appear in court May 13. The reality star and businesswoman has previously detailed her experience during the robbery, at one point tearing up in an interview with David Letterman as she described how she feared she would be sexually assaulted and possibly killed during the attack. \\u201cI was like, \\u2018OK, this is the time I\\u2019m going to get raped ... just prepare yourself,\\u201d she said in the interview, wiping away tears, later describing how she feared her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, would find her dead. \\u201cI just kept on thinking about Kourtney,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to be traumatized for the rest of her life if she sees me.\\u201d Gabrielle Nolin reported from Paris and Chantal Da Silva from London.

For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,\\\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \\\"I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America\\u2019s most ruthless and violent Offenders,\\\" he added. Alcatraz Island, a former military fortress and prison in San Francisco Bay, was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and over the course of 29 years housed more than 1,500 people \\\"deemed difficult to incarcerate elsewhere in the federal prison system,\\\" according to the National Park Service. According to a National Park Service study, it was initially deemed unfit to serve as a federal institution because of its small size, isolated location and lack of fresh water. However, Sanford Bates, the director of the Bureau of Prisons in 1933, later found it \\\"an ideal place of confinement for about 200 of the most desperate or irredeemable types.\\\" It was formally opened as a federal penitentiary the next year. Trump suggested in his post that he'd like to restore the facility to that purpose. \\\"When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That\\u2019s the way it\\u2019s supposed to be,\\\" he wrote. The director of the Bureau of Prisons, William K. Marshall III, said in a statement that his agency \\\"will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President\\u2019s agenda.\\u201d \\u201cI have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,\\\" Marshall said. \\\"USP Alcatraz has a rich history. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice.\\\" According to the Bureau of Prisons, the average population of Alcatraz during its use was 260 to 275. The facility never reached its capacity of 336 people, and it held less than 1% of the total federal prison population. Trump seemed to suggest the island could be used to house some undocumented immigrants he has been seeking to remove from the country, making a pointed reference in his post to \\\"judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals who came into our country illegally.\\\" Trump in March sent more than 200 deportees he accused of being Venezuelan gang members to a terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, arguing his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act enabled him to do so, even though a federal judge blocked the effort. A Trump-appointed federal judge last week rejected Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members. Trump decried the judicial rulings in explaining his rationale for reopening the prison Sunday evening, describing Alcatraz as a famous \\\"symbol of law and order.\\\" \\\"The judges, so many of these radicalized judges, they want to have trials for every single, think of it, every single person that\\u2019s in our country illegally,\\\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday evening. \\\"That would mean millions of trials, and it\\u2019s just so ridiculous what\\u2019s happening.\\\" Trump similarly announced an effort in March to detain immigrants he's seeking to deport in Guant\\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, but concerns about the legality and the cost of the move have led the administration to reconsider the plan. The Bureau of Prisons operates at least 120 federal institutions and manages a population of 156,254 people. It is unclear how feasible the move is considering ongoing budget constraints at the Bureau of Prisons, which told a union representing some of its staff members in December that it planned to close several facilities. Alcatraz closed as a penitentiary in 1963, according to the Bureau of Prisons, because of expensive operating costs further heightened by the physical isolation of the island, which meant all food and supplies had to be delivered by boat. \\\"An estimated $3-5 million was needed just for restoration and maintenance work to keep the prison open. That figure did not include daily operating costs \\u2014 Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison,\\\" the Bureau of Prisons wrote of the penitentiary's closing. Nearly a decade later, in 1972, Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, which included Alcatraz Island. The complex opened to the public a year later, and it has gone on to become among the most popular National Park Service sites, according to the agency, hosting more than 1 million visitors annually. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, whose district includes the island, said Trump's proposal \\\"is not a serious one,\\\" noting on X that it is now \\\"a major tourist attraction.\\\" A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom also downplayed the legitimacy of the idea. \\u201cLooks like it\\u2019s distraction day again in Washington, D.C.,\\\" said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, Newsom's deputy director of communication. Nnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.\",\n          \"A planned bombing at a Lady Gaga concert in Brazil on Saturday night was foiled and a suspect is in custody, Brazilian authorities said. Unidentified people were \\u201cvirtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks\\u201d using improvised explosive devices, the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police said. The perpetrators planned to gain notoriety on social networks through the bombing, authorities said. The person accused of being responsible for the plan is in custody, and a teenager has been detained in connection with the matter, police said. Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security alleged in a statement that the plot was organized by a larger extremist network that operates online to radicalize adolescents and provoke hate crimes. It's unclear when authorities found out about the threat. The civil police intelligence unit was first alerted to the scheme, and search and seizure warrants were obtained for multiple areas in Brazil, police said. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said her team learned about the alleged threat through media reports Sunday morning. \\u201cPrior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\\u201d the spokesperson said. \\u201cHer team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\\u201d Lady Gaga singer posted about the show on her Instagram account Sunday, praising the crowd for their vibrancy throughout it. \\\"I wish I could share this feeling with the whole world\\u2014I know I can\\u2019t, but I can say this\\u2014if you lose your way, you can find your way back if you believe in yourself and work hard,\\\" Gaga wrote. She did not address the alleged bombing threat. Lady Gaga played at the famed Copacabana venue as part of her new \\u201cMayhem\\u201d tour. She announced the show in February on Instagram, saying she was excited to return after having had to cancel her last show in Brazil because of a hip injury during her \\u201cBorn This Way Ball\\u201d tour. She added that she was \\u201cdying to come perform\\u201d for her Brazilian \\u201clittle monsters,\\u201d which is the nickname for Lady Gaga fans. The free concert Saturday was attended by 2.5 million people, according to concert organizers. It is the largest attendance for a female artist, the organizers said, beating Madonna's draw of 1.6 million people at the Copacabana Beach last year. It falls shy of the Guinness World Record for the largest free concert, which was also at the beach venue. Rod Stewart's performance at the Copacabana in 1994 for New Year's Eve brought in an estimated 3.5 million revelers. Rio\\u2019s security plan included 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers and 400 military firefighters. The show was supported by the local government in hope of boosting economic activity between big events in Rio, such as Carnival and next month's Saint John\\u2019s Day celebrations. More than 500,000 tourists flocked to the city to see Lady Gaga, Rio\\u2019s City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Taylor Swift was forced to cancel her shows in Vienna because of a security threat less than a year ago. Austrian authorities said they were alerted to plans to bomb Swift's Eras Tour performances in the city in a terrorism-related attack. Swift opted to cancel the concerts and waited until the end of her European leg of the tour. \\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\\u201d Swift said weeks later. \\u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\\u201d Swift had expressed anxiety about keeping people safe during her live performances, citing the 2017 bombing at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester, England, and the 2017 music festival shooting in Las Vegas.

Mike Lawler\\u2019s suburban New York swing district unloaded a barrage of criticism on the Republican during a raucous town hall Sunday night, peppering him with questions around President Donald Trump\\u2019s aggressive agenda before devolving into a chaotic chorus of boos as attendees were removed by law enforcement. The town hall in Somers, a leafy section of Lawler\\u2019s Hudson Valley district, began to teeter off the rails soon after it began. The first crack emerged when Lawler, in his opening remarks, told the packed-out prep school auditorium \\u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\\u201d Laughter crept through the crowd. A little while later, the congressman\\u2019s mention of federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. drew loud jeers. \\u201cSo you want, for instance, petroleum-based dyes to continue?\\u201d Lawler asked in response. Republicans, in some instances, have made themselves scarce in their home districts following President Donald Trump\\u2019s first few months in office, as party leadership expresses wariness of viral blowback against Republicans in vulnerable seats. Lawler, a moderate who last year won a second term and has openly expressed interest in running for governor, has instead sought to put himself in front of voters, holding a previous town hall late last month and has plans for more in the coming weeks. On Sunday, Lawler\\u2019s staff required people to RSVP and set up a series of ground rules, including that attendees live in the district, not record at the event, refrain from shouting or standing, and \\u201cbe respectful of one another, of staff, and of the Congressman,\\u201d a sign at the door read. At one point, as Lawler was responding to a question about tariffs, security and law enforcement began to surround a woman in the upper stretch of the auditorium. The crowd chanted \\u201clet her stay, let her stay\\u201d before law enforcement picked her up and carried her out. It was unclear what exactly led to her removal. \\u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\\u201d the audience yelled. Lawler tried to get back on track: \\u201cFolks, tariffs are way more complicated than you want to make them.\\u201d The crowd groaned. \\u201cFolks, enough!\\u201d Lawler said above the din. Soon after, another person was removed. Then another. In the audience, Jeanette Spoor, a 74-year-old retiree, said she wanted to ask Lawler about the future of Social Security and Medicaid but wasn\\u2019t called on during the nearly two-hour event. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not helping your constituents if you\\u2019re making it hard for them to get help,\\u201d she said in an interview. She added, \\u201cI have no hopes for this guy.\\u201d Another attendee, Kristi Thompson, 52, said she was bothered by what she said were Lawler\\u2019s long-winded answers that didn\\u2019t address the substance of the crowd\\u2019s questions. \\u201cHe claims to be available to constituents, but he isn\\u2019t,\\u201d she said. The crowd walked out during the final question of the night, which was about protests against Israel. Lawler began to answer but cut himself off as the room emptied out. \\u201cI appreciate everybody coming out tonight and taking the time to ask your questions and hear my answers, whether you liked them or not, or agreed with them or not, or whether you really actually wanted to listen to them or not, but I very much appreciate you participating,\\u201d he said as attendees exited.

Mayor Muriel Bowser, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris, among other officials. The three spoke briefly, and Bowser touted the draft's ability to bring business to the city. \\\"We believe in investing in sports because they have helped us transform neighborhoods, and the NFL bringing this event to the nation's capital will help us fill hotel rooms, our restaurants, and Americans from all 50 states will come to their nation's capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums,\\\" Bowser said. NBC News previously reported that the announcement was expected. Axios was first to report the expected announcement. The NFL declined to comment on Sunday. The NFL draft is an annual selection of the top college football players by individual teams. To be eligible, players must have been out of high school for at least three years. From 1965 to 2014, the draft took place in New York City, but it has since rotated to different host cities. More than 600,000 people were on site in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last month for the most recent three-day event. The announcement comes as Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser went public last week with plans to return to Washington and build a new stadium after 27 years in Maryland. The president praised the plans, saying in the Oval Office that he did not think \\\"there is a better site anywhere in the world than that site.\\\" Trump, who once owned a United States Football League team and aspired (but failed) to own an NFL franchise, followed the 2025 draft from afar. He criticized NFL owners on social media for not taking Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders in the first round. \\u201cWhat is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?\\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \\u201cDeion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He\\u2019s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be \\u2018picked\\u2019 IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!\\u201d Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was expected to be a top pick but fell to the fifth round before he was taken by the Cleveland Browns. The president has a history of sparring with the NFL. During his first term, he called on owners to fire players who were kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice and other issues and claimed the protests were hurting the league's television ratings and ticket sales. At a Sept. 2017 rally, Trump said, \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \\u2018Get that son of a b---- off the field right now? Out! He\\u2019s fired. He\\u2019s fired.'\\\" In a statement that did not mention Trump by name, Goodell referred to the president's comments as \\u201cdivisive\\u201d and said they showed \\u201can unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.\\u201d Trump then shot back at Goodell, saying, \\\"Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country. Tell them to stand!\\\" The president doubled down on his criticism of anthem protests during a 2018 Fox News interview, saying \\\"maybe\\\" people who protested during the national anthem \\\"shouldn't be in the country.\\\" Garrett Haake is NBC News' senior White House correspondent.

Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12. Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal. As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know. One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment. Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \\u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \\u2014 against him in early April. The indictment alleges Combs \\\"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\\\" which was \\\"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\\\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him. The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \\\"Freak Offs,\\\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \\\"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\\\" and sometimes lasted multiple days. Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \\\"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\\\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment. In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct. According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3. Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors. If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him. His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \\\"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\\\" \\\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\\\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment. A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial. The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN obtained and published the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs. Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage. Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \\\"Freak Off.\\\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \\\"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\\\" between the two. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said. Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial. Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions. They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers. It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial. Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors. In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \\\"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\\\" nor acknowledge \\\"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\\\" They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners. Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \\\"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\\\" Elias E.

The break-in happened just before 3 a.m. on the 300 block of 15th Street at Que Rico Nightclub. For the business owner, it's another break-in that will add to mounting costs to cover damages and product replacement. The owner of Que Rico Nightclub, Valentino Carrillo, said the burglary cost them about $5,000 in damages and thousands in alcohol. In the past four years, the amount they've lost due to break-ins is about $100,000, Carrillo said. And insurance won't be helping them. \\\"As a small business, you can't really turn to insurance cause they'll drop you. And actually, last month, we got dropped regardless of having any claims,\\\" Carrillo said. Que Rico will be selling $1 tacos on Tuesday as part of fundraiser to hopefully recoup some of the damages.

For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,\\\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \\\"I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America\\u2019s most ruthless and violent Offenders,\\\" he added. Alcatraz Island, a former military fortress and prison in San Francisco Bay, was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and over the course of 29 years housed more than 1,500 people \\\"deemed difficult to incarcerate elsewhere in the federal prison system,\\\" according to the National Park Service. According to a National Park Service study, it was initially deemed unfit to serve as a federal institution because of its small size, isolated location and lack of fresh water. However, Sanford Bates, the director of the Bureau of Prisons in 1933, later found it \\\"an ideal place of confinement for about 200 of the most desperate or irredeemable types.\\\" It was formally opened as a federal penitentiary the next year. Trump suggested in his post that he'd like to restore the facility to that purpose. \\\"When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That\\u2019s the way it\\u2019s supposed to be,\\\" he wrote. The director of the Bureau of Prisons, William K. Marshall III, said in a statement that his agency \\\"will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President\\u2019s agenda.\\u201d \\u201cI have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,\\\" Marshall said. \\\"USP Alcatraz has a rich history. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice.\\\" According to the Bureau of Prisons, the average population of Alcatraz during its use was 260 to 275. The facility never reached its capacity of 336 people, and it held less than 1% of the total federal prison population. Trump seemed to suggest the island could be used to house some undocumented immigrants he has been seeking to remove from the country, making a pointed reference in his post to \\\"judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals who came into our country illegally.\\\" Trump in March sent more than 200 deportees he accused of being Venezuelan gang members to a terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, arguing his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act enabled him to do so, even though a federal judge blocked the effort. A Trump-appointed federal judge last week rejected Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members. Trump decried the judicial rulings in explaining his rationale for reopening the prison Sunday evening, describing Alcatraz as a famous \\\"symbol of law and order.\\\" \\\"The judges, so many of these radicalized judges, they want to have trials for every single, think of it, every single person that\\u2019s in our country illegally,\\\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday evening. \\\"That would mean millions of trials, and it\\u2019s just so ridiculous what\\u2019s happening.\\\" Trump similarly announced an effort in March to detain immigrants he's seeking to deport in Guant\\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, but concerns about the legality and the cost of the move have led the administration to reconsider the plan. The Bureau of Prisons operates at least 120 federal institutions and manages a population of 156,254 people. It is unclear how feasible the move is considering ongoing budget constraints at the Bureau of Prisons, which told a union representing some of its staff members in December that it planned to close several facilities. Alcatraz closed as a penitentiary in 1963, according to the Bureau of Prisons, because of expensive operating costs further heightened by the physical isolation of the island, which meant all food and supplies had to be delivered by boat. \\\"An estimated $3-5 million was needed just for restoration and maintenance work to keep the prison open. That figure did not include daily operating costs \\u2014 Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison,\\\" the Bureau of Prisons wrote of the penitentiary's closing. Nearly a decade later, in 1972, Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, which included Alcatraz Island. The complex opened to the public a year later, and it has gone on to become among the most popular National Park Service sites, according to the agency, hosting more than 1 million visitors annually. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, whose district includes the island, said Trump's proposal \\\"is not a serious one,\\\" noting on X that it is now \\\"a major tourist attraction.\\\" A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom also downplayed the legitimacy of the idea. \\u201cLooks like it\\u2019s distraction day again in Washington, D.C.,\\\" said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, Newsom's deputy director of communication. Nnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.\",\n          \"A planned bombing at a Lady Gaga concert in Brazil on Saturday night was foiled and a suspect is in custody, Brazilian authorities said. Unidentified people were \\u201cvirtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks\\u201d using improvised explosive devices, the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police said. The perpetrators planned to gain notoriety on social networks through the bombing, authorities said. The person accused of being responsible for the plan is in custody, and a teenager has been detained in connection with the matter, police said. Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security alleged in a statement that the plot was organized by a larger extremist network that operates online to radicalize adolescents and provoke hate crimes. It's unclear when authorities found out about the threat. The civil police intelligence unit was first alerted to the scheme, and search and seizure warrants were obtained for multiple areas in Brazil, police said. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said her team learned about the alleged threat through media reports Sunday morning. \\u201cPrior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\\u201d the spokesperson said. \\u201cHer team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\\u201d Lady Gaga singer posted about the show on her Instagram account Sunday, praising the crowd for their vibrancy throughout it. \\\"I wish I could share this feeling with the whole world\\u2014I know I can\\u2019t, but I can say this\\u2014if you lose your way, you can find your way back if you believe in yourself and work hard,\\\" Gaga wrote. She did not address the alleged bombing threat. Lady Gaga played at the famed Copacabana venue as part of her new \\u201cMayhem\\u201d tour. She announced the show in February on Instagram, saying she was excited to return after having had to cancel her last show in Brazil because of a hip injury during her \\u201cBorn This Way Ball\\u201d tour. She added that she was \\u201cdying to come perform\\u201d for her Brazilian \\u201clittle monsters,\\u201d which is the nickname for Lady Gaga fans. The free concert Saturday was attended by 2.5 million people, according to concert organizers. It is the largest attendance for a female artist, the organizers said, beating Madonna's draw of 1.6 million people at the Copacabana Beach last year. It falls shy of the Guinness World Record for the largest free concert, which was also at the beach venue. Rod Stewart's performance at the Copacabana in 1994 for New Year's Eve brought in an estimated 3.5 million revelers. Rio\\u2019s security plan included 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers and 400 military firefighters. The show was supported by the local government in hope of boosting economic activity between big events in Rio, such as Carnival and next month's Saint John\\u2019s Day celebrations. More than 500,000 tourists flocked to the city to see Lady Gaga, Rio\\u2019s City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Taylor Swift was forced to cancel her shows in Vienna because of a security threat less than a year ago. Austrian authorities said they were alerted to plans to bomb Swift's Eras Tour performances in the city in a terrorism-related attack. Swift opted to cancel the concerts and waited until the end of her European leg of the tour. \\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\\u201d Swift said weeks later. \\u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\\u201d Swift had expressed anxiety about keeping people safe during her live performances, citing the 2017 bombing at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester, England, and the 2017 music festival shooting in Las Vegas.

Mike Lawler\\u2019s suburban New York swing district unloaded a barrage of criticism on the Republican during a raucous town hall Sunday night, peppering him with questions around President Donald Trump\\u2019s aggressive agenda before devolving into a chaotic chorus of boos as attendees were removed by law enforcement. The town hall in Somers, a leafy section of Lawler\\u2019s Hudson Valley district, began to teeter off the rails soon after it began. The first crack emerged when Lawler, in his opening remarks, told the packed-out prep school auditorium \\u201cThis is what democracy looks like.\\u201d Laughter crept through the crowd. A little while later, the congressman\\u2019s mention of federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. drew loud jeers. \\u201cSo you want, for instance, petroleum-based dyes to continue?\\u201d Lawler asked in response. Republicans, in some instances, have made themselves scarce in their home districts following President Donald Trump\\u2019s first few months in office, as party leadership expresses wariness of viral blowback against Republicans in vulnerable seats. Lawler, a moderate who last year won a second term and has openly expressed interest in running for governor, has instead sought to put himself in front of voters, holding a previous town hall late last month and has plans for more in the coming weeks. On Sunday, Lawler\\u2019s staff required people to RSVP and set up a series of ground rules, including that attendees live in the district, not record at the event, refrain from shouting or standing, and \\u201cbe respectful of one another, of staff, and of the Congressman,\\u201d a sign at the door read. At one point, as Lawler was responding to a question about tariffs, security and law enforcement began to surround a woman in the upper stretch of the auditorium. The crowd chanted \\u201clet her stay, let her stay\\u201d before law enforcement picked her up and carried her out. It was unclear what exactly led to her removal. \\u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\\u201d the audience yelled. Lawler tried to get back on track: \\u201cFolks, tariffs are way more complicated than you want to make them.\\u201d The crowd groaned. \\u201cFolks, enough!\\u201d Lawler said above the din. Soon after, another person was removed. Then another. In the audience, Jeanette Spoor, a 74-year-old retiree, said she wanted to ask Lawler about the future of Social Security and Medicaid but wasn\\u2019t called on during the nearly two-hour event. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not helping your constituents if you\\u2019re making it hard for them to get help,\\u201d she said in an interview. She added, \\u201cI have no hopes for this guy.\\u201d Another attendee, Kristi Thompson, 52, said she was bothered by what she said were Lawler\\u2019s long-winded answers that didn\\u2019t address the substance of the crowd\\u2019s questions. \\u201cHe claims to be available to constituents, but he isn\\u2019t,\\u201d she said. The crowd walked out during the final question of the night, which was about protests against Israel. Lawler began to answer but cut himself off as the room emptied out. \\u201cI appreciate everybody coming out tonight and taking the time to ask your questions and hear my answers, whether you liked them or not, or agreed with them or not, or whether you really actually wanted to listen to them or not, but I very much appreciate you participating,\\u201d he said as attendees exited.

They rallied from a 2-0 series deficit to oust Los Angeles in six games in the first round. Then they opened the second round Tuesday night by setting a league record with their fifth consecutive playoff comeback victory in a single postseason. Zach Hyman scored from just above the right circle with 3:02 left to put Edmonton ahead for good in its 4-2 victory over Vegas Golden Knights after falling behind 2-0. \\u201cThat\\u2019s part of having a mature, older group,\\u201d Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. \\u201cPlayers have seen a lot, a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. In the playoffs, things fluctuate. There\\u2019s a lot of things that can stress out the team. No matter what happens, I think we handled it really well tonight.\\u201d Vegas, which had just seven shots on goal over the final two periods, lost a playoff game in regulation after leading by at least two goals for the first time. The Golden Knights are 47-4 overall in the postseason with that kind of lead. Game 2 is Thursday night in Las Vegas. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll go over it and get ready for Thursday night\\u2019s game,\\u201d said Mark Stone, who scored both Vegas goals. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be a big one for us.\\u201d Leon Draisaitl had a goal and an assist for the Oilers, and Corey Perry and Connor Brown scored the other goals. Evan Bouchard and Connor McDavid each had two assists. McDavid now has four consecutive postseasons with at least 10 assists for fourth-best in league history. Calvin Pickard was barely tested after the first period and finished with 15 shots. \\u201cWe have experience to win games in a lot of different ways, a lot of untraditional ways,\\u201d Hyman said. \\u201cAny time you get a win, it\\u2019s a big day. We\\u2019ve got to take what we did in the second and third and do in the first.\\u201d Stone tied Jonathan Marchessault\\u2019s franchise record with 36 goals for his Vegas career. He also extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. Adin Hill made 24 saves. Both star-studded top lines delivered in the first period, with Stone scoring twice, the first on a double-minor power play. Edmonton\\u2019s top unit cut the deficit in half with 3:34 left when Perry deked Hill for an open net with McDavid and Draisaitl getting assists on the play. Neither team scored in the second period even though the Oilers outshot Vegas 12-1. The Golden Knights had never been held to fewer than two shots on goal in a regulation playoff period. Edmonton didn\\u2019t waste a chance early in the third, tying the score 57 seconds in when Draisaitl backhanded a shot off the boards and off Hill. Hyman, who earlier in the shift took a stick to the face from Kaedan Korczak, broke the tie in the closing minutes, and Brown sealed the win 1:16 later. Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo did not play because of an illness, allowing Korczak to make his first career postseason start. Vegas also was without Pavel Dorofeyev, who led the team with 35 goals this season, for the second game in a row because of an undisclosed injury. Coach Bruce Cassidy has descibed him as day to day. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (AP) \\u2014 Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It\\u2019s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top. The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia\\u2019s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term. \\u201cPresident Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,\\u201d retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president\\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week. For Trump, it\\u2019s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft. It\\u2019s not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump\\u2019s actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe. He\\u2019s shaping a foreign policy that\\u2019s more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren\\u2019t meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance. Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world. The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what\\u2019s-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe. Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump\\u2019s \\u201cledger\\u201d approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy. Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, \\u201cWinning isn\\u2019t everything. It\\u2019s the only thing.\\u201d \\u201cBut diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,\\u201d Frantz said. \\u201cSometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.\\u201d Trump on Thursday told reporters that he has decided to make Saudi Arabia the first overseas visit of his new term because the oil-rich kingdom has agreed to make a huge investment in the United States over the next four years. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve gotten richer, we\\u2019ve all gotten older. So I said, \\u2019I\\u2019ll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies,\\u2019\\u201d Trump said. He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment. Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America\\u2019s oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks. In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has \\u201cthe cards\\u201d and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly. Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded. Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was \\u201cregrettable.\\u201d He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. \\u2014 even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians \\u2014 that Trump wants. In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy\\u2019s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials. But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia. \\u201cI\\u2019m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don\\u2019t have the cards,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cIn terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.\\u201d Trump\\u2019s push on Zelenskyy \\u2014 and pivot toward Moscow \\u2014 marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War. Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden\\u2019s approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv\\u2019s involvement. At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration. Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion. Kellogg, who also served in Trump\\u2019s first White House, recalled seeing Trump\\u2019s \\u201ctransactional diplomacy approach\\u201d early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president\\u2019s first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same. \\u201cAs I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, \\u2019What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?\\u2019'' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event. The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico. Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them. The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs. \\u201cCanada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,\\u201d Trump said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America\\u2019s 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump\\u2019s trade war. The episode has underscored Trump\\u2019s willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world\\u2019s most durable and amicable alliances. The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump\\u2019s move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,\\u201d Trudeau said. \\u201cBut Donald, they point out that even though you\\u2019re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\\u201d ___ AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.\",\n          \"Aaron Gordon went to the postgame interview room after his latest heroic moment for the Denver Nuggets, took a seat with his two nephews on his lap and waited for somebody to say something. He finally broke the silence. \\u201cAny questions?\\u201d he asked. Seems about right that he would ask that, given that so far in these NBA playoffs Gordon has been one of the players with all the answers in the biggest moments \\u2014 when games are on the line. He is one of the contenders for the unofficial title of Mr. Game Winner of these playoffs, his case built around a no-time-left dunk \\u2014 believed to be the first of its kind in postseason history \\u2014 to beat the Los Angeles Clippers in Round 1, then a 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds left to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night. \\u201cDid I know it was in? I knew it wasn\\u2019t a miss,\\u201d Gordon said of his latest game winner. And Gordon isn\\u2019t alone in being part of these down-to-the-wire moments. Tyrese Haliburton \\u2014 another Mr. Game Winner candidate \\u2014 now has two such shots as well in these playoffs, the latest coming in the form of a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to beat top-seeded Cleveland 120-119 on Tuesday night for a 2-0 Pacers lead in that series. That one came after he had a layup with 1.4 seconds left in overtime of the Pacers\\u2019 series-clinching, frantic Game 5 rally in the final moments to oust Milwaukee. \\u201cObviously, had to get lucky,\\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said Tuesday night after Haliburton\\u2019s latest heroics led his team\\u2019s second successful comeback from seven points down and less than a minute left in a three-game span. \\u201cTyrese hit another amazing shot to win the game. You don\\u2019t see this very often, let alone twice in one week. We\\u2019re very fortunate.\\u201d He\\u2019s right. You don\\u2019t see this very often. There are five players \\u2014 Robert Horry in 2002, LeBron James in 2006 and 2018, Jamal Murray last year, and now Gordon and Haliburton this year \\u2014 who have hit two go-ahead shots in the final 10 seconds of wins in the same postseason. That\\u2019s it. That\\u2019s the whole list. \\u201cThis is what I do,\\u201d Haliburton said in the on-court interview afterward, still out of breath. Round 2 is just getting underway in these NBA playoffs and already there have been 15 games decided by three points or fewer, matching or exceeding the total from each of the last 10 playoff years. The New York Knicks have won five games so far in the playoffs, four of them by three points or fewer. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just going to keep fighting,\\u201d the Knicks\\u2019 Mikal Bridges said after the Game 1 win at Boston on Monday night. \\u201cThat\\u2019s who we are ... and we keep showing it.\\u201d This is not normal: So far, 30% of games in this year\\u2019s playoffs going into Tuesday have been decided by three points or fewer. It\\u2019s happening about twice as often as it did last season and about three times as often as it did in other postseason runs over the last decade. Of those 15 games so far decided by three points or fewer, five of them have had a go-ahead basket in the final 10 seconds. There\\u2019s the two by Haliburton, the two by Gordon, and the other was New York\\u2019s Jalen Brunson hitting a 3-pointer to beat Detroit in Round 1. Brunson was the NBA\\u2019s top clutch player this season. Haliburton is an Olympic champion. Gordon was part of Denver\\u2019s run to the NBA title two years ago. In the biggest moments, they know what is required. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not about putting the team on my back,\\u201d Brunson said. \\u201cI have confidence in them. They have confidence in me. We\\u2019re going to compete. We\\u2019re going to find the best way to attack each possession. It may look like I get the credit ... but it\\u2019s not just me.\\u201d Brunson had a chance to win Game 1 at Boston with a last-second floater in regulation \\u2014 \\u201cnot clutch enough,\\u201d he mused when asked about it after the Knicks finished off the overtime win \\u2014 but the Knicks found a way anyway. New York was down by 20 in that game and won; Boston was 40-1 this season in games when it had a lead of 20 or more. Denver was down by 14 at Oklahoma City and won; the Thunder are 64-2 this season in games in which they led by at least 12 points against anybody besides the Nuggets, but they\\u2019re only 2-3 in such games against Denver. The Nuggets now have three wins by three points or fewer so far in these playoffs. \\u201cWe make stupid mistakes,\\u201d Denver star Nikola Jokic, who had a historic 42-point, 22-rebound effort, told Altitude TV after the Game 1 win. \\u201cBut we find a way.\\u201d At this time of year, finding a way is the only thing that\\u2019s required. Haliburton, Gordon and Brunson have proven that. ___ On Basketball analyzes the biggest topics in the NBA.

It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics. \\\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\\\" Harris told Vogue. \\\"Artistic expression \\u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \\u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\\\" To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit \\\"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\\\" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said. While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States. Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own. Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028. \\\"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\\\" she said. Sources familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office.

The facility struggles financially, given its small size and the area's tiny population. But for over a decade, the Hugo, Colorado-based health system has remained afloat partially thanks to a surprising source: special taxes on the state's hospitals. The taxes Lincoln pays help cover the state's Medicaid costs and \\u2014 because the federal government matches a portion of what states spend on Medicaid \\u2014 enable Colorado to claim more federal money. That generally leads to more dollars for the hospital. The tax proceeds also have helped Colorado expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover 400,000 more low-income adults, significantly reducing the number of people showing up at hospital doors without insurance. Last year, Lincoln paid $500,000 in provider taxes but netted more than $3.6 million extra from Medicaid, accounting for about 15% of its budget, said Lincoln CEO Kevin Stansbury. \\\"These dollars allow me to care for patients who are enrolled in Medicaid and to break even rather than lose money,\\\" he said. \\\"Without them, it would significantly impact our ability to survive.\\\" Every state except Alaska uses at least one provider tax to boost its federal Medicaid dollars. But Republicans who control Congress are looking for potential cuts in the nearly $900 billion Medicaid program to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts \\u2014 and have sought to portray provider taxes as malicious, sometimes even deriding them as \\\"money laundering.\\\" Lawmakers say they may curtail or eliminate provider taxes as part of legislation to enact Mr. Trump's domestic agenda. \\\"It's infuriating,\\\" Stansbury said. Medicaid and the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program together cover roughly 79 million low-income and disabled people and are jointly financed by states and the federal government. Federal dollars match state payments with no limit. While the split varies based on a state's per capita income, the federal match ranges from 50% to 77% for children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, who make up most of the enrollment. States started using provider taxes in the 1980s to help pay their share and gain additional Medicaid funds from the federal government. Brian Blase, a former Trump health policy adviser who leads the conservative Paragon Health Institute, sees provider taxes as one of the highest forms of waste in Medicaid. States and their hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers aren't held accountable for how the tax money is used, reducing incentives for states to control Medicaid spending, he said. \\\"This has been a feature of the program for four decades, and it is a feature that is getting worse,\\\" Blase said. The Congressional Budget Office estimates eliminating provider taxes would save the federal government more than $600 billion over a decade. Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), who chairs the House committee that oversees Medicaid, has said provider taxes are on the menu for potential cuts. Other changes Republicans are considering to cut federal Medicaid spending include requiring adult enrollees to prove they're working as a condition of eligibility, as well as ending higher payments for adults enrolled as part of the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program. Since 2014, more than 20 million nondisabled adults in 40 states and Washington, D.C., have gained coverage under the expansion. House Republicans have set a Memorial Day deadline to come to an agreement on spending cuts, which would help pay for extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts passed during Mr. Trump's first administration and set to expire at the end of this year. The Government Accountability Office and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a congressional advisory board, have raised concerns about the provider taxes, which effectively saddle federal taxpayers with state expenses. Republican and Democrat presidents have criticized or proposed curtailing the use of Medicaid provider taxes \\u2014 including Mr. Trump in his first term, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden while serving as vice president. But opposition from hospitals, nursing homes, and states snuffed out any move to limit or end the arrangements. Colorado and other states often use the money to maintain or increase payments to providers, which are often paid less by Medicaid than by Medicare, the federal program primarily for people 65 or older, or private insurers. States have added provider taxes to help generate federal money to cope with economic downturns and budget constraints. Hospitals in Idaho last year began paying an additional provider tax to increase pay to hospitals and home- and community-based providers. The tax came as Idaho's Republican-controlled legislature sought to add many conditions that threatened to end the state's Medicaid expansion \\u2014 which would also eliminate a key source of increased federal funding. Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association, said funding from the hospital tax helps boost Medicaid payments to about 80% of Medicare's rates instead of 60%. \\\"We still lose money on every Medicare and Medicaid patient,\\\" he said. \\\"The state recognizes that this money helps offset the losses we take under Medicaid reimbursement.\\\" While hospitals and nursing homes have been the main beneficiaries of provider tax proceeds, ambulance services have also paid and benefited from Medicaid taxes. States increasingly have also approved Medicaid taxes on private insurers that operate their Medicaid programs to gain more federal funds. California's Medicaid managed care tax began in 2009 and is expected to generate nearly $9 billion in net revenue for the 2024-25 fiscal period \\u2014 or about 5% of the state's Medicaid budget, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office. In recent years, California has extended full Medicaid coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal status. Federal law prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to cover people in the country without authorization, but states can use their own money. At a presentation to congressional staffers in April, Blase cited California's strategy as an example of provider tax abuse and claimed the state is effectively laundering federal funds to cover people living in the country illegally. In practice, the tax has been a kind of fiscal pressure valve generally offsetting state spending. A ballot measure that passed in November now requires that much of the money from California's tax specifically be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Hospital officials and state Medicaid leaders argue the term \\\"money laundering\\\" is an inaccurate way to describe provider taxes, since they are allowed by federal law. But Blase said calling the levies a \\\"tax\\\" is misleading, pointing out that most businesses don't typically advocate to pay one. Jamie Whitney, chief legal officer for Texas-based Adelanto HealthCare Ventures, a consulting firm, said that provider taxes are a politically neutral way to help states pay for Medicaid and that curtailing their use would harm them all. \\\"This is not a red-state, blue-state issue,\\\" she said. Colorado is one of more than a dozen states that have funded an ACA Medicaid expansion using provider tax money. Others include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Colorado implemented its Medicaid provider tax effort in 2009. In the 2024 fiscal year, about $5 billion of the state's $15 billion Medicaid program was funded by provider taxes, according to the state. The money helps the state pay higher Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals, which reduces their need to charge higher rates to private insurers, said Kim Bimestefer, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which oversees Medicaid. Some of the extra payments are dependent on hospitals meeting certain quality and patient-safety metrics, such as reducing readmission rates after patients are discharged \\u2014 a requirement state officials say improves care for everyone. The provider taxes also fund a program allowing working residents with disabilities to buy into Medicaid coverage even if their income is as high as 300% of the federal poverty level, or $46,950 for an individual. About 20,000 people are enrolled in the program. Among them is Alison Sbrana, 31, of Fort Collins, Colorado, who has a type of chronic fatigue syndrome and relies on Medicaid to cover long-term home care. \\\"It would be devastating if the benefit went away,\\\" said Sbrana, who works as a researcher and activist for those with the same disorder. \\\"I would be forced to stop working to keep my income low enough to qualify.\\\" The state's provider taxes also pay for a $60 million fund to support rural hospitals, helping them add telehealth services, recruit surgeons, and hire paramedics, according to a state report. Konnie Martin, CEO of San Luis Valley Health, a two-hospital system based in Alamosa, Colorado, said her nonprofit paid $5.4 million in provider taxes last year and gained about $15 million in benefits from higher Medicaid payments and the rural grants. She said the money helps her hospital maintain obstetrical services, so residents don't have to drive 120 miles to the nearest maternity hospital. Without the birthing center, the entire region would suffer, she said. \\\"It also would gut the economy of the community, because young people will move away,\\\" she said.

Among those arrested was a Sinaloa cartel leader, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, 36, a Mexican national, who was taken into custody in Salem, Oregon, Bondi said at a press conference. In February, the State Department designated the Sinaloa cartel as a foreign terrorist organization. Asked whether any of those arrested would be deported to Mexico, Bondi said \\\"I want them to stay in our prisons as long as possible.\\\" \\\"Most of these individuals, if convicted, will remain in American prisons, perhaps Alcatraz,\\\" the attorney general added in reference to the shuttered California prison that President Donald Trump said he wants to reopen. The Justice Department said law enforcement officials seized more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of fentanyl pills, 11.5 kilos of fentanyl powder, 80 kilos of methamphetamine, 7.5 kilos of cocaine and 4.5 kilos of heroin. The bust also netted $5 million in cash and 49 rifles and pistols, U.S. officials said, while releasing several images of the seized items. \\\"This case represents DEA's largest single seizure of fentanyl pills,\\\" said Robert Murphy, the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Bondi said 75,000 Americans are dying each year because of fentanyl and it is the number one cause of death for people between the ages of 18 and 34 in the United States. \\\"They are flooding our cities with a weapon of mass destruction, fentanyl,\\\" she said. Ryan Ellison, U.S. attorney for the district of New Mexico, said the \\\"sophisticated fentanyl and narcotics distribution network\\\" spanned New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. Ellison said the 16 people arrested face various federal charges including conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and firearms offenses. The DEA says drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 44, though most states have seen fewer deaths over the last few years. Between 2022 and 2023, overdose deaths decreased by 4% nationwide, marking the first such decline since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Overdose deaths fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying \\\"a very fast death\\\". In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a \\\"calm and steady approach\\\" to talks in a bid to \\\"ease pressure on UK businesses\\\". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being \\\"jobless\\\" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a \\\"knock-out blow\\\". The UK film sector is worth \\u00a31.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October. Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed. White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: \\\"Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.\\\" But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit. \\\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\\\" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said. Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: \\\"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\\\" A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is \\\"dominated\\\" by inward investment from US studios and that this \\\"brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK\\\". Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned \\\"against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe\\\" when the report came out. \\\"President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,\\\" she said. Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios. She urged ministers to \\\"urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way\\\". Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must \\\"get a grip\\\" to secure a trade deal with the US and \\\"protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success\\\". It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: \\\"The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means. \\\"A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot? \\\"Hollywood\\u2026 has been in decline for some time,\\\" he said. \\\"A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia.\\\" He added: \\\"One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world.\\\" Bell concurred that \\\"the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places\\\" and lower costs. \\\"People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed.\\\" She added: \\\"The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood.\\\" According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20 percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (\\u00a3248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive. A government spokesperson said on Monday: \\\"The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world. \\\"We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon. \\\"Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers.\\\" Dozens of Hollywood blockbusters in recent years have actually seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, including:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Mayor Muriel Bowser, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris, among other officials. The three spoke briefly, and Bowser touted the draft's ability to bring business to the city. \\\"We believe in investing in sports because they have helped us transform neighborhoods, and the NFL bringing this event to the nation's capital will help us fill hotel rooms, our restaurants, and Americans from all 50 states will come to their nation's capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums,\\\" Bowser said. NBC News previously reported that the announcement was expected. Axios was first to report the expected announcement. The NFL declined to comment on Sunday. The NFL draft is an annual selection of the top college football players by individual teams. To be eligible, players must have been out of high school for at least three years. From 1965 to 2014, the draft took place in New York City, but it has since rotated to different host cities. More than 600,000 people were on site in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last month for the most recent three-day event. The announcement comes as Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser went public last week with plans to return to Washington and build a new stadium after 27 years in Maryland. The president praised the plans, saying in the Oval Office that he did not think \\\"there is a better site anywhere in the world than that site.\\\" Trump, who once owned a United States Football League team and aspired (but failed) to own an NFL franchise, followed the 2025 draft from afar. He criticized NFL owners on social media for not taking Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders in the first round. \\u201cWhat is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?\\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \\u201cDeion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He\\u2019s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be \\u2018picked\\u2019 IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!\\u201d Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was expected to be a top pick but fell to the fifth round before he was taken by the Cleveland Browns. The president has a history of sparring with the NFL. During his first term, he called on owners to fire players who were kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice and other issues and claimed the protests were hurting the league's television ratings and ticket sales. At a Sept. 2017 rally, Trump said, \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \\u2018Get that son of a b---- off the field right now? Out! He\\u2019s fired. He\\u2019s fired.'\\\" In a statement that did not mention Trump by name, Goodell referred to the president's comments as \\u201cdivisive\\u201d and said they showed \\u201can unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.\\u201d Trump then shot back at Goodell, saying, \\\"Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country. Tell them to stand!\\\" The president doubled down on his criticism of anthem protests during a 2018 Fox News interview, saying \\\"maybe\\\" people who protested during the national anthem \\\"shouldn't be in the country.\\\" Garrett Haake is NBC News' senior White House correspondent.

Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12. Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal. As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know. One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment. Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \\u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \\u2014 against him in early April. The indictment alleges Combs \\\"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\\\" which was \\\"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\\\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him. The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \\\"Freak Offs,\\\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \\\"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\\\" and sometimes lasted multiple days. Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \\\"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\\\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment. In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct. According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3. Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors. If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him. His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \\\"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\\\" \\\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\\\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment. A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial. The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN obtained and published the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs. Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage. Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \\\"Freak Off.\\\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \\\"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\\\" between the two. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said. Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial. Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions. They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers. It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial. Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors. In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \\\"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\\\" nor acknowledge \\\"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\\\" They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners. Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \\\"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\\\" Elias E.

The break-in happened just before 3 a.m. on the 300 block of 15th Street at Que Rico Nightclub. For the business owner, it's another break-in that will add to mounting costs to cover damages and product replacement. The owner of Que Rico Nightclub, Valentino Carrillo, said the burglary cost them about $5,000 in damages and thousands in alcohol. In the past four years, the amount they've lost due to break-ins is about $100,000, Carrillo said. And insurance won't be helping them. \\\"As a small business, you can't really turn to insurance cause they'll drop you. And actually, last month, we got dropped regardless of having any claims,\\\" Carrillo said. Que Rico will be selling $1 tacos on Tuesday as part of fundraiser to hopefully recoup some of the damages.

Mayor Muriel Bowser, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris, among other officials. The three spoke briefly, and Bowser touted the draft's ability to bring business to the city. \\\"We believe in investing in sports because they have helped us transform neighborhoods, and the NFL bringing this event to the nation's capital will help us fill hotel rooms, our restaurants, and Americans from all 50 states will come to their nation's capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums,\\\" Bowser said. NBC News previously reported that the announcement was expected. Axios was first to report the expected announcement. The NFL declined to comment on Sunday. The NFL draft is an annual selection of the top college football players by individual teams. To be eligible, players must have been out of high school for at least three years. From 1965 to 2014, the draft took place in New York City, but it has since rotated to different host cities. More than 600,000 people were on site in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last month for the most recent three-day event. The announcement comes as Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser went public last week with plans to return to Washington and build a new stadium after 27 years in Maryland. The president praised the plans, saying in the Oval Office that he did not think \\\"there is a better site anywhere in the world than that site.\\\" Trump, who once owned a United States Football League team and aspired (but failed) to own an NFL franchise, followed the 2025 draft from afar. He criticized NFL owners on social media for not taking Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders in the first round. \\u201cWhat is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?\\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \\u201cDeion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He\\u2019s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be \\u2018picked\\u2019 IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!\\u201d Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was expected to be a top pick but fell to the fifth round before he was taken by the Cleveland Browns. The president has a history of sparring with the NFL. During his first term, he called on owners to fire players who were kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice and other issues and claimed the protests were hurting the league's television ratings and ticket sales. At a Sept. 2017 rally, Trump said, \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \\u2018Get that son of a b---- off the field right now? Out! He\\u2019s fired. He\\u2019s fired.'\\\" In a statement that did not mention Trump by name, Goodell referred to the president's comments as \\u201cdivisive\\u201d and said they showed \\u201can unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.\\u201d Trump then shot back at Goodell, saying, \\\"Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country. Tell them to stand!\\\" The president doubled down on his criticism of anthem protests during a 2018 Fox News interview, saying \\\"maybe\\\" people who protested during the national anthem \\\"shouldn't be in the country.\\\" Garrett Haake is NBC News' senior White House correspondent. Greg Rosenstein is the sports editor for NBC News Digital.\",\n          \"Sean \\\"Diddy\\\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12. Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal. As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know. One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment. Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \\u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \\u2014 against him in early April. The indictment alleges Combs \\\"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\\\" which was \\\"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\\\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him. The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \\\"Freak Offs,\\\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \\\"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\\\" and sometimes lasted multiple days. Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \\\"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\\\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment. In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct. According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3. Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors. If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him. His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \\\"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\\\" \\\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\\\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment. A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial. The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN obtained and published the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs. Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage. Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \\\"Freak Off.\\\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \\\"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\\\" between the two. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said. Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial. Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions. They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers. It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial. Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors. In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \\\"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\\\" nor acknowledge \\\"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\\\" They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners. Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \\\"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\\\" Elias E.

The break-in happened just before 3 a.m. on the 300 block of 15th Street at Que Rico Nightclub. For the business owner, it's another break-in that will add to mounting costs to cover damages and product replacement. The owner of Que Rico Nightclub, Valentino Carrillo, said the burglary cost them about $5,000 in damages and thousands in alcohol. In the past four years, the amount they've lost due to break-ins is about $100,000, Carrillo said. And insurance won't be helping them. \\\"As a small business, you can't really turn to insurance cause they'll drop you. And actually, last month, we got dropped regardless of having any claims,\\\" Carrillo said. Que Rico will be selling $1 tacos on Tuesday as part of fundraiser to hopefully recoup some of the damages.
