Lady Gaga says she was unaware of thwarted bomb threat until learning about it from media,"Unidentified people were “virtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks” to gain online notoriety, according to the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/planned-bombing-lady-gaga-rio-de-janiero-rcna204698,"A planned bombing at a Lady Gaga concert in Brazil on Saturday night was foiled and a suspect is in custody, Brazilian authorities said. Unidentified people were “virtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks” using improvised explosive devices, the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police said. The perpetrators planned to gain notoriety on social networks through the bombing, authorities said. The person accused of being responsible for the plan is in custody, and a teenager has been detained in connection with the matter, police said. Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security alleged in a statement that the plot was organized by a larger extremist network that operates online to radicalize adolescents and provoke hate crimes. It's unclear when authorities found out about the threat. The civil police intelligence unit was first alerted to the scheme, and search and seizure warrants were obtained for multiple areas in Brazil, police said. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said her team learned about the alleged threat through media reports Sunday morning. “Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,” the spokesperson said. “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.” Lady Gaga singer posted about the show on her Instagram account Sunday, praising the crowd for their vibrancy throughout it. ""I wish I could share this feeling with the whole world—I know I can’t, but I can say this—if you lose your way, you can find your way back if you believe in yourself and work hard,"" Gaga wrote. She did not address the alleged bombing threat. Lady Gaga played at the famed Copacabana venue as part of her new “Mayhem” tour. She announced the show in February on Instagram, saying she was excited to return after having had to cancel her last show in Brazil because of a hip injury during her “Born This Way Ball” tour. She added that she was “dying to come perform” for her Brazilian “little monsters,” which is the nickname for Lady Gaga fans. The free concert Saturday was attended by 2.5 million people, according to concert organizers. It is the largest attendance for a female artist, the organizers said, beating Madonna's draw of 1.6 million people at the Copacabana Beach last year. It falls shy of the Guinness World Record for the largest free concert, which was also at the beach venue. Rod Stewart's performance at the Copacabana in 1994 for New Year's Eve brought in an estimated 3.5 million revelers. Rio’s security plan included 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers and 400 military firefighters. The show was supported by the local government in hope of boosting economic activity between big events in Rio, such as Carnival and next month's Saint John’s Day celebrations. More than 500,000 tourists flocked to the city to see Lady Gaga, Rio’s City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Taylor Swift was forced to cancel her shows in Vienna because of a security threat less than a year ago. Austrian authorities said they were alerted to plans to bomb Swift's Eras Tour performances in the city in a terrorism-related attack. Swift opted to cancel the concerts and waited until the end of her European leg of the tour. “Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,” Swift said weeks later. “The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.” Swift had expressed anxiety about keeping people safe during her live performances, citing the 2017 bombing at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester, England, and the 2017 music festival shooting in Las Vegas.

"Ruth Buzzi, comedy sketch player on groundbreaking series 'Laugh-In,' dies at 88",Buzzi rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In.”,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/ruth-buzzi-comedy-sketch-player-groundbreaking-series-laugh-dies-88-rcna204459,"LOS ANGELES — Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In” and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died at age 88. Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi’s Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: “She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.” Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot. She was first spotted by “Laugh-In” creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on “The Steve Allen Comedy Hour.” Schlatter was holding auditions for “Laugh-In” when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead. “I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,” he wrote in his 2023 memoir “Still Laughing A Life in Comedy.” “I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.” The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On “Laugh-In,” her most frequent target was Arte Johnson’s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh. “Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,” Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. “So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who’s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that’s almost everyone at some time or other.” Buzzi took her act to the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in Las Vegas, where she bashed her purse on the heads of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Lucille Ball, among others. Her other recurring characters on “Laugh-In” included Flicker Farkle; Busy-Buzzi, a Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge regular who got drunk with husband Leonard, played by Dick Martin; and an inconsiderate flight attendant. “I never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,” Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. “I was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.” Buzzi remained friends through the years with “Laugh-In” co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley. Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school. Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors’ Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse’s College of Theatre Arts. Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast. She got her national television break on “The Garry Moore Show” in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician’s assistant to Dom DeLuise’s character Dominic the Great. Buzzi was a regular on the CBS variety show “The Entertainers” whose hosts included Burnett and Bob Newhart. She was in the original Broadway cast of “Sweet Charity” with Gwen Verdon in 1966. Buzzi toured the country with her nightclub act, including appearances in Las Vegas. She was a semi-regular on “That Girl” as Marlo Thomas’ friend. She co-starred with Jim Nabors as time-traveling androids on “The Lost Saucer” in the mid-1970s. Her other guest appearances included variety shows hosted by Burnett, Flip Wilson, Glen Campbell, Tony Orlando, Donny and Marie Osmond and Leslie Uggams. She appeared in Ball’s last comedy series “Life With Lucy.” Buzzi guested in music videos with “Weird Al” Yankovic, the B-52’s and the Presidents of the United States of America. She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including “Pound Puppies,” “Berenstain Bears,” “The Smurfs” and “The Angry Beavers.” She was Emmy nominated for her six-year run as shopkeeper Ruthie on “Sesame Street.” Her movie credits included “Freaky Friday,” “Chu Chu and the Philly Flash,” “The North Avenue Irregulars” and “The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.” Buzzi was active on social media and had thousands of followers whom she rewarded with such one-liners as “I have never faked a sarcasm” and “Scientists say the universe is made up entirely of neurons, protons and electrons. They seem to have missed morons.” She married actor Kent Perkins in 1978. The couple moved from California to Texas in 2003 and bought a 640-acre ranch near Stephenville. Buzzi retired from acting in 2021 and suffered a series of strokes the following year. Her husband told The Dallas Morning News in 2023 that she had dementia."
Blake Lively said past year filled with 'lowest lows' of her life amid legal battle with Justin Baldoni,"The “Another Simple Favor” star talked about her ""intense"" year during a recent Seth Meyers appearance.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/blake-lively-said-year-filled-lowest-lows-life-legal-battle-justin-bal-rcna204438,"Blake Lively is speaking out about what she’s going through. The “Another Simple Favor” star made an appearance on the May 1 episode of “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and spoke about the highs and lows she’d experienced. Host Seth Meyers first mentioned to Lively that he was “not totally informed” about the details of what she said was an “intense” year. “I’m thrilled you’re not doing ‘Weekend Update’ right now, because you’d be totally informed,” Lively joked. Meyers followed with a prompt to see what Lively was willing to share. “But were I to ask you about it I’d imagine you’re in a situation where you can’t say much,” he said. Lively characterized using her “voice” as a fight to “make the world safer for women in girls.” “What I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It’s what keeps us silent,"" she said. ""I acknowledge that many people don’t have the opportunity to speak,"" Lively continued. ""I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It’s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls. It’s a pretty simple thing,” she said. Following her comments, Lively received a round of applause from the audience. It should be noted that Lively or Meyers made no specific mention of her legal case involving Justin Baldoni and their film “It Ends With Us.” Back in January, a New York judge announced that both Lively and Baldoni’s lawsuits against each other would be addressed in a trial set for March 9, 2026. Lively starred and produced “It Ends With Us,” while Baldoni directed and co-starred. The film premiered in August 2024, yet before its release, people began speculating that there was tension between the cast. By December 2024, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, with her attorneys stating that, in multiple incidents, Baldoni harassed Lively on set and crossed boundaries during intimate scenes, according to an administrative complaint filed Dec. 20, 2024 and obtained by TODAY.com. Attorneys for Baldoni denied the accusations at the time. On Dec. 31, Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, seeking $250 million in damages, over the newspaper’s coverage of Lively’s accusations of sexual harassment and being the target of a smear campaign. Also on Dec. 31, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni’s publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and “It Ends With Us,” in which her legal team argued she had been a victim of sexual harassment and a smear campaign, according to court documents obtained by NBC News. In response, in January 2025, Baldoni sued Lively, accusing her, her husband Ryan Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane’s PR firm of defamation and other contractual claims. In a statement to NBC News in Jan. 16, 2025, Lively’s legal team said the lawsuit was “another chapter in the abuser playbook,” denying the allegations. Baldoni and his team would go on to create a website about the lawsuit against Lively, filled with their complaint and alleged emails and texts from those involved in the creation of “It Ends With Us.” Lively’s By February, the judge overseeing their trial didn’t restrict what their attorneys could say publicly but he did issue a warning about public comments, according to NBC News. Later that month, Lively amended her original complaint, alleging that other women had complained about Baldoni’s misconduct, as well as added a new claim for defamation. Attorneys for Baldoni did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News about Lively’s amended complaint at the time."
"Singer Jill Sobule, known for 'I Kissed a Girl,' dies in house fire",Sobule was 66. The 1995 song was the first openly queer-themed record to reach Billboard’s Top 20.,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/jill-sobule-kissed-girl-dies-fire-rcna204334,"Singer Jill Sobule, known for the 1995 song “I Kissed a Girl,” died in a Minnesota house fire Thursday morning, her representatives said. She was 66. The fire occurred in Woodbury, a city around 16 miles east of Minneapolis, they said. Officials there said firefighters discovered a dead woman after a house fire that was reported around 5:30 a.m. Thursday. “Jill Sobule was a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture,” manager John Porter said in a statement. ""I Kissed a Girl” reached No. 20 on Billboard’s modern rock chart, the first openly queer-themed record to do so. Sobule’s song “Supermodel” from the “Clueless” soundtrack was also a pop success. Sobule most recently created a coming-of-age musical, ""F--- 7th Grade,"" an off-Broadway show that debuted in 2022. It was a Drama Desk nominee for ""outstanding musical"" the next year and was named a New York Times Critic Pick. Sobule had been scheduled to perform Friday in Denver at Swallow Hill, where an informal gathering will now be held to remember her, instead, her reps said. In 2008, Katy Perry released “I Kissed a Girl,” which was not a cover of Sobule's song. After Sobule made comments that she said were deliberately over the top and ironic, she was targeted by Perry fans who took the comments seriously. “I may be a touch cynical about the business, but I have never really been angry or had ill feelings towards Katy herself,” Sobule wrote on what was then known as The Huffington Post. “I was actually in a small way happy to not be the ‘Kissed a Girl’ girl anymore.” She said she hoped Perry fans were “okay with the title of my brand new song, ‘I Kissed a Girl ...First,’” she wrote, adding “Wink.” Sobule is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, James and Mary Ellen Sobule, and her nephews, Ian Matthew and Robert, and Robert’s wife, Irina, her reps said.

George Lucas finally explains why Yoda speaks backward in ‘Star Wars’ films,His style of speech is intentional.,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/george-lucas-explains-why-yoda-speaks-backwards-star-wars-films-rcna203784,"Know now do we why speaks that way does Yoda. “Star Wars” creator George Lucas is peeling back the curtain on why Yoda speaks backwards in the film franchise. “Yoda had a very distinctive way of talking, and it was done purposely because if you were speaking regular English, people don’t listen that much, but if he has an accent, or it’s really hard to understand what he’s saying, they focus on what he’s saying,” he told Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz last week during a screening of “The Empire Strikes Back” at the TCM Classic Film Festival. “He was basically the philosopher of the movie, so he was talking about all of the things in long talking scenes and stuff where I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen, especially 12-year-olds.” Yoda is known for his wisdom, with such lines as “Try not. Do or do not. There is no try,” “The greatest teacher, failure is” and “Much to learn, you still have.” Yoda’s first appearance in the “Star Wars” franchise came in 1980 in “The Empire Strikes Back.” The character was voiced by Frank Oz, who also provided it for “Return of the Jedi,” the prequel trilogy and “The Last Jedi.” He and other actors have also voiced Yoda in various related “Star Wars” projects over the years. Oz said he came up with Yoda’s unusual speaking style before getting Lucas’ blessing to do it. “I was just looking at the original script of ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ the other day and there was a bit of that odd syntax in it, but also it had Yoda speaking very colloquially,” he told The Guardian in 2021. “So I said to George (Lucas): ‘Can I do the whole thing like this?’ And he said: ‘Sure!’ It just felt so right.” Oz also said he doesn’t get tired of people doing impressions of Yoda, either. “No I’m used to it. But people don’t understand, anyone can do a voice. It’s not the voice — it’s the soul,” he said. A new “Star Wars” film is due out in 2027. Earlier this month, the movie’s director, Shawn Levy, revealed that Ryan Gosling will star in it."

King Charles opens up about cancer diagnosis and treatment,"The British monarch, who was diagnosed with cancer in February 2024, has kept the details of his disease private.",https://www.nbcnews.com/world/united-kingdom/king-charles-opens-cancer-diagnosis-treatment-rcna203812,"LONDON — King Charles III opened up Wednesday about the lessons he has learned from his cancer diagnosis and treatment, an experience that he said ""brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity."" Speaking at a Buckingham Palace celebration of community-based initiatives raising cancer awareness and supporting those living with the disease, Charles said that ""each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening experience for those individuals and their loved ones."" ""It has certainly given me an even deeper appreciation of the extraordinary work undertaken by the remarkable organizations and individuals gathered here this evening, many of whom I have known, visited and supported over the years,"" he said. ""And it has reinforced what I have long observed during these visits — that the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion."" Charles thanked the health care professionals providing cancer treatment, saying that ""they have my whole family’s deepest admiration and gratitude"" and that their care ""represents the very best our country can offer."" ""What strikes us repeatedly is the profound impact of human connection — whether in the careful explanation from a specialist nurse, the hand held by a hospice volunteer or the shared experience in a support group,"" he said. ""These moments of kinship create what I might call a 'community of care,' one that sustains patients through the most difficult of times."" Charles was diagnosed with cancer in February 2024. He has kept much of his dealings with the disease, including what type of cancer he has or the stage of the disease, private. Most recently, he was hospitalized last month because of side effects from his treatment, according to Buckingham Palace. Charles was diagnosed last year just weeks before news that Princess Kate, 43, was undergoing ""preventative chemotherapy,"" piling on to shock waves about the British monarchy around the world. About 20 million cancer cases were newly diagnosed, and 9.7 million people died from the disease worldwide in 2022, according to the most recent global statistics from the American Cancer Society. Charles concluded the speech and left listeners with a quotation from Dame Deborah James, a British journalist, podcaster and educator who died of bowel cancer in 2022 and whose parents were at the event.

Robert De Niro's daughter Airyn comes out as transgender,"The 29-year-old spoke to Them, an LGBTQ magazine, about starting hormone therapy and finally embracing her femininity.",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/robert-de-niro-daughter-airyn-transgender-rcna203775,"Airyn De Niro, daughter of Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro, opened up about starting hormone therapy and coming out as transgender in an interview published Tuesday. De Niro, 29, spoke to Them, an LGBTQ magazine owned by Condé Nast, about feeling she was out of place. De Niro, whose mother is Toukie Smith, described herself as a ""late bloomer"" who failed to fit in with societal standards growing up. ""I was always told I was too much of something or not enough of something growing up: Too big, not skinny enough,"" she told the magazine. ""Not Black enough, not white enough. Too feminine, not masculine enough. It was never just, ‘You’re just right, just the way you are.’” She credited the stories of openly transgender women — including Laverne Cox and queer activist Marsha P. Johnson — with inspiring her to embrace her femininity last year. ""Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media and getting to see them in their success ... I’m like, you know what? Maybe it’s not too late for me,” she said. She added that as she has embraced her gender identity, she has also been influenced by Black women and has been able to embrace her Black ancestry. One of the first outward expressions of her gender identity, she said, was deciding to get dreadlocks after she saw Halle Bailey in the 2023 live-action film ""The Little Mermaid."" Despite being the child of two actors, De Niro credited her parents for doing their best to shield her from the public eye throughout her childhood. Her father was also insistent that she forge her own career path, she said. She expressed her gratitude for that upbringing while also saying she wants to be public now to give others someone to aspire to. And in a time when civil rights for transgender people are being targeted, she said she is studying to be a mental health counselor to aid the community. ""People of color and queer people definitely need more mental health advocacy and support,"" she said. ""So I’m hoping I’m able to do that.""

Christie Brinkley recalls Billy Joel’s 7-word response to her writing a memoir,The model and author of “Uptown Girl” opens up about her marriage to the iconic musician.,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/christie-brinkley-memoir-billy-joel-marriage-rcna203780,"Christie Brinkley, one of the most recognizable faces in modeling, offers a revealing glimpse into the challenges of being one of the world’s original supermodels in her new memoir, “Uptown Girl.” Gracing the cover of more than 500 magazines and appearing in memorable movies like the 1983 hit film, “National Lampoon’s Vacation,” Brinkley’s career spans five decades, and she delves into much of it in her new book. “I just want to tell some stories,” Brinkley tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. “I hope it’ll be a nice diversion in a world that can use a good book every now and then, take you away on a little adventure.” From being discovered at a payphone in Paris to being kicked out of Frank Sinatra’s hotel room, “Uptown Girl” offers insight behind Brinkley’s upbringing in Southern California and her ascent to the top of the modeling world. The book also explores her four marriages (and divorces), including 11 years she spent with Billy Joel. It’s the music legend who penned “Uptown Girl,” the song that inspired the memoir’s title, which has become Brinkley’s enduring nickname — in spite of the fact that, according to the supermodel, it wasn’t initially written for her. Brinkley writes in her memoir that it started out as a song for a “mystery girl” Joel had been having phone conversations with, but when his relationship with Brinkley began, he finished it in her honor. Their relationship was then immortalized in the hit song’s iconic music video, in which Brinkley appears in. In “Uptown Girl,” Brinkley, 71, opens up about her various heartbreaks, difficult early childhood with an abusive father and the helicopter accident that almost claimed her life in 1994. However, the model says that opening up about her marriage to Joel was the most difficult part of penning the memoir. “The hardest thing to include was criticism of Billy, because I do care about my friendship with him,” she says of the chapters that reveal Joel’s heavy drinking and suggested affairs, which has been making headlines since her book came out. “In the book, I feel like I balanced, very much, about how happy we were and how joy-filled our days were,” she says of their marriage. “It was literally dancing in the kitchen as we cooked, singing together, and making each other laugh. It was a beautiful, wonderful relationship.” According to the memoir, that relationship became strained, in part, after Joel sued Frank Weber, his former manager, for having allegedly siphoned off his profits. It was a betrayal that Brinkley writes left Joel “withdrawn and stressed” as singer-songwriter felt immense pressure to recoup his financial loss. “He was going through extraordinary circumstances in his life, things most people wouldn’t ever have to deal with,” she describes. Despite the vulnerable nature of the admissions, Brinkley says they were important to include in the memoir. “I did have to go there because that was the reality.” Brinkley tells TODAY.com that Joel had given his blessing to talk candidly about the ups and downs of their longtime relationship. “He said, ‘Just say what you need to say,’” Brinkley recalls. “And I think that’s part of his healing, so I applaud him for all of that. It takes a lot of courage.” The new memoir reveals some darker times in their relationship, including instances of Brinkley waking up in the middle of the night to discover Joel was missing, then him returning home in the wee hours of the morning after being out drinking all night. She also writes about the growing distance in their marriage that ultimately left her feeling “lonely, despite the fact that he was right there.” It was a loneliness so pervasive that Brinkley was thinking about Joel as she boarded a helicopter in Colorado, shortly after their separation in 1994, and wondered if the crooner would be worried about her embarking on a trip to go heli-skiing. “For a moment I thought about my husband, Billy, whom I’d split with again, and hoping this trip to Telluride would wake him up to the reality that he might actually lose me,” she writes. What she didn’t know was that shortly after, the helicopter would crash into the San Juan mountains, leaving Brinkley and several companions temporarily stranded until they were rescued. Though Joel ultimately flew to her side and jetted her back to Long Island aboard a private plane, her dream of their reunion was dashed when she overheard him on the phone saying to an unknown caller, ‘No, don’t worry. I’m not going back to her. I just need to see her through this.’” The revelation brought home the fact that their marriage was over. Two weeks later, they announced their divorce and as she penned in her memoir, “the dream broke apart like debris.” Despite their divorce, Brinkley tells TODAY.com that they still remain friends. “He’s a very loyal guy. He’s loyal to his friends, he’s generous. He just had a lot of stresses on him at the point when we were together and it just kind of came crashing down on us.” Outside of her marriage, the helicopter crash changed her life in other ways. “I went through a phase of post-traumatic stress disorder,” she says of the accident that left her clinging to the side of a mountain amid a pile of helicopter wreckage. “One of the hallmarks is bad decision-making. And I made quite a few, which I lay out in the book and that chapter was hard to write just because I didn’t want to think about any of (the helicopter crash). I didn’t want to go back to that place. At the time when it happened, I actually thought it was so awful, I wanted to purge it from my body and from my memory banks.” While she’s endured her fair share of trauma, Brinkley remains the eternal optimist, both in love and life. “I was raised in a very positive household, so I was raised to be grateful and counting my blessings and to know the good things that I have, no matter what,” she says. Among those blessings are Brinkley’s three children: Alexa Ray Joel, 39, her daughter with Joel, as well as her son, Jack Brinkley-Cook, 29, and other daughter, Sailor Brinkley-Cook, 26, both of whom she shares with her ex-husband Peter Cook. While appearing on the April 28 episode of ""TODAY,"" Brinkley shared that out of her three children, her oldest daughter is the one who’s read most of her memoir and that she loves it. “She was kind of blown away by it,” said Brinkley. As for the other two, the model joked that her younger children “skimmed through” it and said, “We know her!” but otherwise, “I don’t think they understand the reason to read it.” Though Brinkley has released two other books, including a 1983 fitness book and “Timeless Beauty,” a wellness guide published in 2015, “Uptown Girl” is her first memoir, and she wants readers to take something positive away from her experiences. “I just really hope people understand that the book is much more than rehashing divorces,” she explains, referring to her other marriages to Jean-Francois Allaux, Richard Taubman and Cook, all of which ended in divorce. “This is not a revenge novel. It’s filled with joy and when there are bad moments, it’s sort of how to keep going and not let them pull you down,” she says. “And how to stay positive and maybe learn something from it or let it propel you into someplace that you didn’t dare go before.”"
"Katy Perry says online critics are trying to make her a 'human piñata' following tour, space flight","“Please know I am ok,” the singer told her fans.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/katy-perry-responds-online-critics-space-flight-rcna203779,"Katy Perry wrote a long response to a fan-made ad congratulating her for finishing the first week of her “Lifetimes” tour, amid backlash about the tour and her recent trip to space. Perry responded to a video of the ad posted to a fan account on Instagram, writing in a comment that she is able to remain true to herself, “heart open and honest,” because of the bond she has with her fans. “Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,” she said. “My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, ‘No one can make you believe something about yourself that you don’t already believe about yourself,’ and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it’s an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it. “When the ‘online’ world tries to make me a human Piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed,” she continued. Perry said that what is real to her is seeing her fans in the crowd every night, “singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth.” “I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that,” she said, adding an infinity emoji. “I’m not perfect, and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I’m on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but… I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS,” she added. Perry’s comment came after her “Lifetimes” tour began on April 23 in Mexico City. The singer has since faced criticism for the show’s choreography and stage design from social media users online. Earlier this month, Perry was also part of the all-female flight crew that took a roughly 10-minute trip to space aboard a Blue Origin spacecraft. The flight quickly garnered controversy, as everyday people, fast-food companies and celebrities, like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski, questioned the sustainability of a trip to space. “What’s the point?” Munn said while co-hosting TODAY With Jenna & Friends on April 3. “Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it’s a bit gluttonous. ... Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they going to do up there that has made it better for us down here?” Perry did not directly respond to the criticism of the flight, but several of her fellow crew members like Lauren Sanchez, Gayle King and Aisha Bowe did during a press conference on April 14. “I’m not going to let you steal our joy, but most people are really excited and cheering us on and realize what this mission means to young women, young girls and boys, too,” King said. “I feel anybody that’s criticizing doesn’t really understand what is happening here,” she added, later in the press conference. “I’ve heard it, we’ve all heard it and we were even all talking about that, and I hope that they will do a deep dive into what this represents.” Sanchez, the fiancée of Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, also shared her perspective. “I get really fired up a little bit on this,” Sanchez said. “I would love to have them come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees that don’t just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle. ... They love their work and they love the mission and it’s a big deal for them.” “So when we hear comments like that, I just say, ‘Trust me. Come with me. I’ll show you what this is about, and it’s really eye-opening,’” she continued."
Michael Bolton reveals glioblastoma diagnosis: ‘You find out what you’re made of’,The singer learned he had the incurable brain cancer in 2023.,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/michael-bolton-reveals-glioblastoma-diagnosis-find-re-made-rcna203765,"Michael Bolton is sharing new details about a somber health diagnosis he’s been navigating over the last year and a half. In a new interview with People, the singer revealed that he has glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer that the Cleveland Clinic defines as the “most common type of malignant (cancerous) brain tumor in adults.” Bolton, 72, said he initially learned that he had glioblastoma in December 2023. The diagnosis came after the singer underwent emergency surgery where doctors removed a brain tumor. One month later, Bolton underwent a second brain surgery in January 2024 following an infection. At the time, he took to Facebook to tell his fans he was taking a break from touring while he recovered from the surgery. Per the Mayo Clinic, there is no cure for glioblastoma but treatments can “slow cancer growth and reduce symptoms.” The disease can occur at any age, but often manifests in older adults. The Cleveland Clinic notes that glioblastoma “can result in death in fewer than six months without treatment.” In October 2024, Bolton wrapped up radiation and chemotherapy. As part of his treatment plan, he now gets an MRI every two months to make sure his tumor hasn’t returned. While reflecting on his cancer journey thus far, Bolton said it has taken a toll both emotionally and physically. For instance, treatment has affected his short-term memory, mobility and speech. “You’re reaching into your resources and your resolve in a way that you never would have thought,” Bolton said. “Succumbing to the challenge is not an option. You’re really quickly drawn into a duel. I guess that’s the way you find out what you’re made of.” The singer said his family has provided plenty of support while he navigates his diagnosis. He also keeps busy working with a personal trainer and voice therapist. “Whenever you find yourself in any kind of challenging position, just to know that you’re not alone going through it is a big deal,” he said. “It actually helps people to know. It reminds them that they’re not alone.” Bolton said he intentionally has avoided asking for a prognosis and prefers to stay positive. “I find comfort in general more easily. (The whole experience) gives me a heightened sense of appreciation. It’s unthinkable for it to be okay not to make the most of your life,” he said. “I think we develop capabilities and problem management, and we learn how to make the best out of a bad situation. You have to be a cheerleader for yourself.” Above all, Bolton is focused on his family and wants to ensure he takes the time to enrich his relationships with his children while he’s able to. “How do I give things that they can take forward? Life lessons, love, any kind of validation that I can give (them) — I want to be on the right side of that so they feel great about who they are,” he said. “It’s a reality of mortality. Suddenly a new light has gone on that raises questions, including ‘Am I doing the best that I can do with my time?’”"
"Terrence Howard refused Marvin Gaye role over prospect of kissing a man, says 'I would cut my lips off'",The former “Empire” star made the confession during a nearly two-hour appearance on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” podcast.,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/terrence-howard-marvin-gaye-biopic-rumored-gay-rcna203519,"Actor Terrence Howard revealed that he refused to portray Marvin Gaye in a potential film because of the Motown singer's rumored homosexuality, saying he'd cut his lips off if he ever kissed a man. The former ""Empire"" star made the comment during a nearly two-hour appearance on Bill Maher's ""Club Random"" podcast. Howard told Maher he turned town a chance to play Smokey Robinson because he was in talks with director Lee Daniels for a possible biopic of Gaye. ""You know what happened with that? I was over at Quincy Jones' house ... I'm asking Quincy, 'I'm hearing rumors that Marvin was gay,'"" Howard said. ""And I'm like, 'Was he gay?' And Quincy is like, 'Yes.'"" Daniels, who was an executive producer on ""Empire,"" has not made a film or television series about Gaye's life and it's unclear when Howard had these conversations. Jones, a celebrated music producer, died in November last year. Gaye was married to two women during his life and was not openly queer. Howard went on to say that the filmmakers would have wanted to explore Gaye's rumored homosexuality and that he could not kiss a man. ""I would cut my lips off,"" Howard said. ""If I kissed a man, I would cut my lips off."" Howard attributed it to him not being able to ""fake it"" and he could not act a role he did not understand. Maher told Howard he would not want to a kiss a man either, but ""I would not do that"" in reference to Howard's self-mutilation comment. ""It does not make me homophobic to not want to kiss a man,"" Maher said, comparing it to gay men who would not be interested in women sexually. The comment received some backlash online, with some calling Howard ""deeply problematic"" and others urging people to stop interviewing Howard. One X user questioned how many times Howard was going to tell the world ""he is uncomfortable with his masculinity."" ""He performs masculinity for the approval and acceptance of cishet men and despises gay men,"" the user wrote. ""We know already."" Another brought up Howard's history with domestic abuse following allegations made by two of his former wives. The user wrote, given the allegations, ""I'm having a hard time believing he likes women."" The actor admitted in a 2015 Rolling Stone interview that he hit his ex-wife Lori McCommas in 2001. Michelle Ghent, Howard's second wife, accused him of assaulting her in a lawsuit that she later dropped. Howard told Rolling Stone that Ghent was attempting to pepper-spray him and he was trying to bat her away. Doha Madani is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News. Pronouns: she/her."
"In retrial openings, prosecutors paint Harvey Weinstein as powerful mogul who 'preyed' on women","Weinstein’s lead attorney forcefully pushed back against the prosecution’s narrative, insisting his client’s sexual encounters were consensual and “mutually beneficial.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/retrial-openings-prosecutors-portray-harvey-weinstein-powerful-mogul-p-rcna202561,"Manhattan prosecutors painted a scathing portrait of Harvey Weinstein at the beginning of his sexual abuse retrial Wednesday, presenting the former Hollywood mogul as a serial predator who wielded his power like a weapon against women. Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey described Weinstein as an entertainment industry kingmaker who “held unfettered power for over 30 years” and “preyed” on women — including the three accusers whose allegations led to the criminal charges at the center of the trial. He “wanted their bodies,” Lucey said, referring to the alleged victims Mimi Haley, Kaja Sokola and Jessica Mann. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to two counts of criminal sexual act in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. He has vehemently denied all allegations of sexual misconduct dating back decades. Lucey, in her opening statement, described Weinstein’s alleged sexual abuse of the three accusers in stark and oftentimes graphic terms. She recounted allegations that Weinstein violently forced himself on them and ignored their pleas to stop. Lucey said Weinstein, “a titan in the industry,” drew in the women by offering to discuss their careers. But the accusers found that he was after something else entirely. “He knew how addictive Hollywood dreams were,” Lucey said. “He knew how the promises of success worked. He strung them along with promises of careers, letters to help, parts in movies ... He simply did not take no for an answer and, if he was told no, he got what he wanted by force.” Haley, a former “Project Runway” production assistant, and Sokola, a former model, allege Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on them in separate incidents in 2006. Mann, a former aspiring actress, alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013. The accusers discovered they were “no match for the man who walked red carpets and rubbed elbows with the famous,” Lucey said. “They stayed quiet for years,” she added, out of “their fear of what he might do to them.” Weinstein’s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, forcefully pushed back against Lucey’s account of events in his opening statement. “What she said to you is not evidence,” Aidalia told jurors at the beginning of his remarks. Aidala implored jurors not to make premature judgements about Weinstein’s character or behavior, drawing on an analogy from his client’s former profession: “You don’t judge a movie by the preview.” “You need to read the whole book and watch the whole movie and put it all in context,” Aidala said, adding that his team believes “there are reasonable doubts” in the prosecution’s case. He went on to argue that Weinstein’s sexual encounters with the accusers were “transactional,” characterizing them as “friends with benefits” arrangements that were “mutually beneficial” and “consensual.” In the case of the three women at the root of the charges, Aidala added, “the casting couch is not a crime scene.” The jury of seven women and five men appeared to listen intently during opening statements. In a statement, Weinstein’s spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said his client’s team believes “the jury selected is one that can assess the facts with clarity and impartiality.” “We are hopeful that this time, the legal process will rise above noise and narrative and allow Harvey Weinstein the fair trial he’s long been denied. He deserves the chance to clear his name and preserve a legacy that has been overshadowed by deeply flawed and misleading accusations,” Engelmayer said. Weinstein’s retrial arrives a year after New York’s highest court overturned the Oscar-winning producer’s conviction on third-degree rape in a 2020 case. The court found the trial judge had improperly allowed testimony based on allegations that were not part of the case. Haley's and Mann’s allegations were part of the first New York trial. Sokola’s allegations are a new element. Weinstein was indicted in September on charges related to her claims. Weinstein has remained in prison because he was convicted in 2022 of another rape in Los Angeles and sentenced to 16 years. The former producer’s lawyers are appealing that conviction. In recent years, Weinstein has faced various health issues, including a diagnosis of bone marrow cancer. He arrives at court in a wheelchair. Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, once lorded over Hollywood. Miramax, their first distribution label, released seminal films such as “The Crying Game” and “Pulp Fiction.” Harvey Weinstein won an Oscar as a producer of “Shakespeare in Love.” In the early 2010s, the brothers’ second distribution firm scored best picture wins for “The King’s Speech” and “The Artist.” Weinstein’s reign came crashing down in 2017 after The New York Times and The New Yorker published exposés detailing his alleged pattern of sexual harassment and assault. The publication of those articles made Weinstein’s accusers realize they no longer needed to keep in their “shame and pain,” Lucey said, adding: “They suddenly realized they were not alone, they would not be isolated or targeted but would be taken seriously."" In all, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said his sexual encounters were consensual. CORRECTION (April 29, 2025, 12:14 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the last name of Weinstein’s attorney. He is Arthur Aidala, not Aidalia.

Kim Kardashian jewelry heist suspect says he regrets 'trauma' he caused her,"Yunice Abbas, who wrote a book confessing to the crime, was the first defendant questioned Tuesday in the trial in connection with the 2016 robbery during which the reality star was held at gunpoint.",https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/kim-kardashian-robbery-suspect-says-regrets-trauma-caused-rcna203440,"PARIS — A key defendant in the trial of a group accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 and stealing $9 million worth of jewelry, has said he has come to regret the trauma he caused the reality star-turned-business mogul in the years since. Yunice Abbas, perhaps the best-known defendant in the trial, said that despite a yearslong criminal history, this was the first time he had truly come to recognize the “trauma” he had caused his victim. “I regret it, not because I got caught, but because ... there was a trauma,” Abbas, 72, said before a jury Tuesday as proceedings against the 10 people charged in connection with the 2016 robbery resumed after launching Monday afternoon. The first of several defendants set to testify in the trial, Abbas had previously confessed to his role in the heist, detailing the robbery in his 2021 book, “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.” The matter of the book came up during the testimony, with Abbas saying that he was not responsible for the title and that he disputes his alleged role in the heist. He added that he was not involved in tying up Kardashian, who was staying in Paris for the city's Fashion Week, instead staying downstairs to keep watch. Abbas and nine others, dubbed the “grandpa robbers” in local media because of their ages — some of the accused are in their 70s and 80s — are alleged to have played a range of roles in the heist including holding Kardashian, 44, at gunpoint and being complicit in that crime. During questioning, Abbas described his criminal past — he has spent a total of almost 20 years in jail for various crimes — including the armed robbery of a bank in Belgium. He said that as a young man, he was fiercely opposed to theft but that he had turned to a life of crime because of the bad influence of friends and money difficulties, in the hope it would prove an easier path. Abbas said his family had suffered because of his crimes, adding that he had “never had a role model” himself and he had done what he thought was needed to try to provide for his children. He spoke rapidly during his testimony, his arm shaking throughout, possibly because he has Parkinson's disease. At one point, the shaking was violent enough for him to hold one hand in the other. In the years since the 2016 robbery targeting Kardashian, Abbas said he now felt “very uneasy” with what happened that day. But, he said, “I can’t do anything besides apologize.” Kardashian had been staying at a private apartment complex in the French capital when five of the accused are alleged to have gained entry into the building and robbed her at gunpoint, taking items including her engagement ring from her then-husband Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The five other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs on Kardashian's whereabouts. In the years since, one defendant has died, while the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants due to medical issues. In addition to Abbas, those standing trial will include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as “Old Omar,” who is alleged to have masterminded the robbery; his son, Harminy, 37, accused of being the getaway driver; Didier “Blue Eyes” Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian’s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, who is accused of tipping the others off on Kardashian's whereabouts. Christiane Glotin, 78, is also among the accused, with authorities alleging she was an accomplice in the heist. At least four defendants were expected to be questioned in court Tuesday. Kardashian herself is expected to appear in court May 13. The reality star and businesswoman has previously detailed her experience during the robbery, at one point tearing up in an interview with David Letterman as she described how she feared she would be sexually assaulted and possibly killed during the attack. “I was like, ‘OK, this is the time I’m going to get raped ... just prepare yourself,” she said in the interview, wiping away tears, later describing how she feared her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, would find her dead. “I just kept on thinking about Kourtney,” she said. “She’s going to be traumatized for the rest of her life if she sees me.” Gabrielle Nolin reported from Paris and Chantal Da Silva from London.

'The Last of Us' Star Gabriel Luna unpacks Joel's death and what's next for Tommy,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 3 of “The Last of Us,” which aired April 27.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/the-last-us-star-gabriel-luna-whats-next-for-tommy-rcna203382,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 3 of “The Last of Us,” which aired April 27. The lives of the “The Last of Us” characters will never be the same following Joel’s death. Pedro Pascal’s character took his last breath in the second episode, the people of Jackson, including Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey), are still reeling from his loss (not to mention the show’s bereft fans). “Whenever you have that type of abrupt shift in your family dynamic, it changes your life,” Gabriel Luna told TODAY.com at a special screening of the show’s third episode hosted by Max and Complex. Luna said that from now on, there is “an absolute, seismic shift in the way the rest of the family interacts with each other.” While Ellie is set on a path of revenge, Tommy, Joel’s brother, is figuring out his next steps, including caring for Ellie. The third episode begins with Tommy looking at Joel’s bloody body, before he starts to wipe his arm clean with a rag. “Give Sarah my love,” Tommy tells his dead brother, referencing Joel’s late daughter, who dies in the show’s premiere. Three months go by and Ellie is adamant about finding Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who killed Joel. She hopes to gather the town’s support. However, Tommy tells Ellie that if they are going to assemble a group to help her in her quest, they have to assemble a council meeting and vote on it. Unfortunately for her, Ellie’s request is voted down. Undeterred, she and Dina (Isabel Merced) forge forward with her plan to go to find Abby in Seattle. Luna shared in a post-screening Q&A that Tommy “absolutely” voted yes to assemble a group to go to Seattle, adding, “I already told her I got her back.” So where does Tommy go from here? Luna said his character feels an even bigger sense of responsibility to protect Ellie. “She’s mine now. She’s my responsibility The weight of of all that, the weight of the burden that she’s taken on, her pursuit of ‘justice’ and revenge is one that she doesn’t go on alone,” Luna said. “I can’t let her.” Luna believes that the question, “Who is the villain?” in the show is one that may be left unanswered so that the audience can address it for themselves. “It’s always a matter of perspective. At some point, I’m the villain in the eyes of whoever may encounter me at any given point,” he said. However, in Tommy’s eyes, he said, “It’s hard to say, because I never met those who brought my brother’s demise upon us.” Luna believes that Tommy doesn’t know Joel killed the Fireflies in an attempt to save Ellie’s life. “And that’s what’s tragic about it, because the fact that Joel kept that with him ‘til his death, and that Ellie is the only one on Earth to live with that is probably why most of these decisions end up being made,” he said. “We make choices and we pay the price. That’s just it. That’s just the whole nature of the whole story,” he said. When it comes down to Joel’s ultimate death, Luna said “to take your main character and end that part of the story” is a “powerful” decision to make. It’s also one that will propel the narrative forward. “That’s life. People die. That’s the truth,” he said. “I love how unyielding our show is about that, and how brutally honest our show is about the way life unfolds for us sometimes, and how abrupt it can be, the shifts, the changes.”"
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame unveils 2025 inductees.

Inductees were announced during the April 27 episode of “American Idol,” with Cyndi Lauper, Outkast, Soundgarden and Chubby Checker among the seven acts who will be enshrined in the performer category. Salt-N-Pepa will enter with the musical influence award, which recognized artists who have impacted culture through their music and performance style. The pair joins Outkast to make it the sixth consecutive year at least one rap act will be inducted. 2025 also marks the fourth straight year four or more women will be inducted. While the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame prepares to welcome a new class of talent, several notable nominees, which were announced in February, did not make the final list of inductees. Oasis and Mariah Carey both failed to get inducted for the second straight year. The Black Crowes, Billy Idol and Phish, which notably won the fan vote, also didn’t make the cut. The inductees are determined by an international voting panel made up of more than 1,200 “artists, historians, and music industry professionals,” the Hall of Fame said in a press release announcing the 2025 nominees. “The selection criteria include an artist’s impact on music culture, influence on other musicians that have followed, as well as the scope and longevity of their career and body of work,” the release stated. But some fans on social media couldn’t believe the high-profile performers did not get inducted. “I love you @MariahCarey and you don’t need a Rock n Roll induction to validate what you’ve meant to the music industry over the last 35 years and the numerous lives you’ve impacted!” one fan wrote. “You are ONE OF ONE and don’t ever forget that!” “Blows my mind that Billy Idol is not on this list,” one person commented. “You’re missing the winner of the fan vote. @phish. What’s the point of having people vote if it doesn’t mean anything?” asked another X user. Phish came in first in the fan vote, followed by Bad Company and Billy Idol, per Variety. “The top five vote-getters in the public fan poll form one ballot, which is weighted the same as the rest of the submitted ballots,” according to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony will stream live Nov. 8 from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Disney+ and on Hulu the next day. An induction special will also air at a later date on ABC. Here’s a look at all the inductees across the various categories:"
Rupert Grint welcomes 'secret' baby No. 2 and reveals her bright and sunny name,"“A 10/10 baby (so far),” Grint wrote in his Ron Weasley-esque baby announcement.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/rupert-grint-welcomes-second-baby-rcna203384,"Rupert Grint, who played the mischievous best friend in the “Harry Potter” movies, still has a bit of that Ron Weasley charm about him. The 36-year-old actor revealed the arrival of his second baby with partner Georgia Groome in an Instagram post on April 27. Along with a sweet snap of his daughter wearing a white onesie and a teeny tiny grey cardigan, Grint wrote: “‘Secret Child Slightly Revealed’ Introducing Goldie G. Grint. ⭐️ A 10/10 baby (so far).” Grint also seemed to thank their OB-GYN by writing, “Shoutout to @alex.digesu for always delivering.” Grint and Groome announced the arrival of their first baby — also a girl — in May 2020. Grint’s Instagram photo from November 2020 is a sweet image of him snuggling his daughter, Wednesday G. Grint. When chatting with Dylan Dreyer on TODAY in 2022, Grint admitted that he had shown his daughter (then only 2 years old) “a few of the ‘Harry Potter’ trailers just to see if she can kind of recognize her dad, and she can! She can.” The proud dad said that Wednesday even has “a Pez dispenser with my head on it,” so she was familiar with seeing him as Ron Weasley. Even back in 2018, Grint said in an interview with British newspaper The Guardian that he was hoping to eventually become a father. “I’d like to settle down and have kids soon,” he said at the time. “If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.” In a 2021 interview with Glamour, Grint said that after becoming a father, “I’ve changed as a person for sure. It kind of happened overnight, lifestyle-wise. I stopped smoking straight away.” And though he mentioned the sacrifices he made in his personal life as a result of “Harry Potter” fame, he said he would still support Wednesday if she decided to pursue a film career. “I would want her to do what she wants, but I think I’d be a real stage mum,” he said at the time.

Director Isaiah Saxon tells TODAY.com about how his ideas came to life for the ochi, the name of the wild beasts who live in the forests surrounding a remote village on the fictional island of Carpathia, where the family-friendly movie is set. “The goal with designing the ochi was to create a realistic-feeling undiscovered primate species, so that a kid watching the film could wonder, ‘Have I just not seen the BBC nature special yet on this animal?’ Like, this feels like a real animal,” Saxon says. “The Legend of Ochi,” out April 25, stars Helena Zengel alongside Finn Wolfhard, best known from his role as Mike Wheeler on “Stranger Things.” When Zengel’s character Yuri discovers a baby ochi who has been left behind, she’s determined to do whatever it takes to get the adorable creature back to its pack. The pair go on an adventure through woodlands, waters and even a grocery store, where the baby ochi quickly melts the hearts of the characters and viewers alike. Filmed in the Carpathian mountains of Romania, the film takes fantastical elements from its location — but the magic of the baby ochi is that it is a puppet, Wolfhard tells TODAY.com. ""I didn’t see the ochi actually in action until I was on set, and the puppeteers showed me. Basically, they said, ‘Do you want to meet him?’ And I just looked at the puppet, and it looked up at me and blinked and had head movements,” Wolfhard said. “It was like a truly real creature.” There are complicated mechanics behind bringing the ochi to life, Wolfhard says, but it all comes together to make the ochi appear like a real-life animal. “The ochi had a whole team of people, and all the puppeteers are actors because they are all trying to get a very specific performance out of the ochi,” Wolfhard says. “It was six people piloting one creature, as opposed to just one actor, but they were such amazing performers. That’s why I like working with practical effects — it’s so fun because you have that human connection with it.” Saxon says inspiration for the gremlins came in part from his longtime obsession with Chinese golden snub-nosed monkeys. He also took elements from lemurs, tarsiers and other primates for the look of the ochi, while borrowing from birdsong and the noises dolphins make for the language the animals use in the film. “It wasn’t looking to movie creatures or mythical creatures. It was looking to nature,” he says. “I really wanted to pull from the wide variety of superpowers that you do find in nature, and real patterns in zoology, and put them into one fictional animal.” The cuteness factor for the baby ochi was important from the start, Saxon says. After drafting up several drawings of what the ochi would look like for the film, Saxon says he reached out to John Nolan Studios in London to create animatronics for the creatures. “They made a prototype that was completely furless and had no facial movement, but immediately, the five puppeteers brought it to life, it was just completely convincing that this was a real being,” Saxon recalls. “It was absolutely adorable from the break.” Saxon says designing the baby ochi as a puppet adds characteristics that play into how lovable the creature becomes throughout the film. “A lot of the little imperfections that you might see in a baby primate trying to move learn how to move their own body, those are the types of little things that come through in rod puppeteering,” he says. “So it had that vulnerability from the beginning, from the puppetry.” Once the crew was on set filming in Romania, “there was a tremendous amount of effort in just like, policing his cuteness,” Saxon says of the baby ochi. He joked about a “last-minute rhinoplasty” to make the baby’s nose cuter after realizing it wasn’t quite right, and other situations on set to ensure the creature had the look he was going for. The film, which launched in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles on April 17, is headed to theaters nationwide on April 25. But the hype for the charm of the baby ochi is only just beginning, as viewers start to react to the gremlin on social media. “I just watched THE LEGEND OF OCHI and I want everyone to know that I would die for this little guy,” one user posted on X. “I completely adored THE LEGEND OF OCHI. It pulls inspiration from Amblin movies like E.T., Jim Henson’s classics, and even Ghibli, but still takes tons of *weird* swings that create its own identity full of wonder,” another X user wrote. “They literally don’t make family adventures like this anymore.” “Just like ‘E.T.’ was for so many of my generation I hope there’s a kid out there whose new favorite movie is THE LEGEND OF OCHI and it inspires them to become a filmmaker,” another X user posted. “Lovely movie.” Another X user said: “The Legend of Ochi is a wholesome fantasy adventure. It has really beautiful puppetry and practical effects that really make the Ochi come to life. You love every second baby Ochi is on screen. The world feels very beautiful and unique.” Others, understandably, were just reacting to finding out how adorable the baby ochi is. “How have I not heard about this darling baby Ochi until today?” a user wrote on X, adding a teary-eyed emoji and two heart-eye emoji. “In love with this little guy,” another X user said with a heart-eyed emoji. “can’t wait to see the movie!” “Omg he’s perfect,” another replied on X to a photo of the baby ochi puppet wearing a baseball cap. A24, the film’s distributor, also joined in on the fun, posting a photo of the baby ochi with its arms raised with the caption, “When you find out The Legend of Ochi isn’t nationwide until next Friday but you need that little guy right now.” “The Legend of Ochi” debuted in theatres on April 25."
Key GOP senator won't support Trump loyalist Ed Martin to be D.C.'s top prosecutor,North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis' decision likely derails Martin's nomination as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/thom-tillis-wont-support-ed-martin-dc-us-attorney-rcna205104,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wouldn't support Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, likely blocking the path to confirmation for the “Stop the Steal” organizer who had closely aligned himself with Jan. 6 defendants. “I’ve indicated to the White House I wouldn’t support his nomination,” Tillis said Tuesday after meeting with Martin on Monday night. Tillis is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing Martin's nomination. The panel has 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, meaning if all other members aside from Tillis voted along party lines, the vote on Martin would end in a tie and his nomination would not be reported favorably to the full Senate. Trump's nomination of Martin, a longtime right-wing activist who had no prosecutorial experience until Trump named him as interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on the day of his inauguration, has raised major concerns with alumni of the office, which prosecutors both federal and local crimes in Washington. Tillis said his concerns about Martin’s involvement in the defense of people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were too much to overcome, but said that Martin agreed with him that there were hundreds of individuals who shouldn't have been included in Trump's mass pardons. “Mr. Martin did a good job of explaining the one area that I think he’s probably right, that there were some people that were over prosecuted, but there were some, 2 or 300 of them that should have never gotten a pardon. And he agreed with that, but the disagreement there had more to do,"" Tillis said. ""If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. Attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protest happened, I’d probably support him, but not in this district.” Martin opened up an investigation into the office's handling of Jan. 6 cases, and several federal prosecutors who worked on Capitol attack cases were fired during his tenure, while Martin demoted others. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney is set to expire on May 20. In a speech at the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, Martin called on “die-hard true Americans” to work until their “last breath” to “stop the steal.” Martin's association with a far-right Jan. 6 rioter who had posed in a Adolph Hitler mustache and who the Justice Department previously called an “an avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer"" also raised concerns during his nomination process, and Martin sought to distance himself from the defendant. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday that he wants ""to put people on the agenda when he ""can help the president be successful in his nominees and and that’s all I can say at this point."" Trump had pushed senators to support Martin as recently as Monday night, writing in a post on Truth Social that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., believed Martin's confirmation was ""IMPERATIVE in terms of doing all that has to be done to SAVE LIVES and to, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN."" Ryan J.

"Angus King III, son of the Maine senator, launches a run for governor",King is seeking to succeed term-limited Gov. Janet Mills. Both are Democrats.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/angus-king-iii-son-maine-senator-launches-run-governor-rcna204866,"Angus King III, an energy executive and a son of independent Sen. Angus King Jr. of Maine, will run for governor as a Democrat, he announced Tuesday. King wants to follow in the footsteps of his father, who served two terms as governor from 1995 to 2003. And he’s vying to replace term-limited Gov. Janet Mills, the longtime Maine Democrat who has made national news in recent months tangling with President Donald Trump’s administration over policies for transgender athletes. In an interview with NBC News ahead of his announcement, King emphasized that, during his career in the private sector, he's been ""building things that solve problems and help people."" ""If you were ever going to do it, now is the time. Right now, people are struggling, are scared. We just have a host of challenges that make life really hard,"" King said of leaving private life, where he's worked on issues like renewable energy and affordable housing, to seek public office. ""Right now, I'm going to run for governor to build a better Maine."" King becomes the second major Democrat to jump into the primary to replace Mills, alongside Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who has a long political resume that includes serving in the top post at Maine's chapter of the ACLU and The Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine, as well as a stint in the state Senate before becoming secretary of state in 2021. The top Republican candidates include Bobby Charles, a longtime former federal government official who served stints in staff positions at the State Department and in the House of Representatives. It's possible that more candidates could join the field, too, in a state that hasn't elected back-to-back governors from the same party in more than a half-century. King weighed in on Mills’ spat with the Trump administration over federal funding related to Maine’s policies toward transgender athletes, which the federal government said violated recent executive orders. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture froze funding for a child nutrition program in the state, the administration lifted the freeze last week and the state agreed to drop its lawsuit. King said that while he’s open to working with the Trump administration if it wants to help Mainers, “I’ll never rest when it comes to helping the people of Maine.” “Any time a bully steals your lunch money and you’re able to get it back from him, that’s a good thing. I’m proud of the governor for doing that,” he said. “I think that what the president has done to Maine, you don’t have to be a Democrat or an independent or a Republican or be from outer space, you know you shouldn’t play politics with kids' school lunches and Social Security,” King said. During his interview and launch video, King, 54, repeatedly pointed to a project he took on while working for a natural gas company in the state that turns cow manure into renewable fuel. The experience of bringing strange bedfellows together (a gas utility company and supporters of renewable energy) to accomplish a shared goal (sustainable energy that reduces emissions) is a theme King leans on heavily. “I haven’t spent my career in Augusta, I’m not a politician,"" he said, referring to the state capital. ""But I’ve spent it building and making things that help people. I did it by bringing people together and importantly, focusing on the things we have in common, not the things that divide us."" “Right now, there’s real value in having an outsider’s perspective, someone who’s built things, created jobs, worked on some of the toughest problems,” he added. While King may have spent his career as an outsider, he sports a very public reminder of his ties to one of the most prominent politicians in the state: his father. The elder King served two terms as Maine's governor and returned to politics in the 2012 election, when he won the Senate seat he now holds, succeeding retiring GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe. He was re-elected to his third term in November. But while the elder King has spent the last 30 years in politics as an independent, his son is running as a Democrat. (The elder King does caucus with Democrats in the Senate.) Asked why he’s choosing to run under the banner of one of the national political parties, he replied he has “a very easy answer.” “I am a Democrat,"" he said. ""I obviously have independent blood running through my body, and I think most people in Maine have independent blood running through their bodies,"" he added. Asked what he learned from the success of his father as well as the state's other political constant over the last few decades, Republican Sen. Susan Collins, King replied that most of Maine's successful politicians have been ""moderate, pragmatic, 'How do we get things done, how do we bring people together?' kind of people."" ""That’s exactly how I'm going to serve as governor of Maine. That's a terrific Maine tradition, and I fit pretty squarely into it,"" he said. He added, ""You can be successful in Maine even if you are not a harsh partisan."" Ben Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News"
Trump says D.C. will host the 2027 NFL draft; Gov. Brian Kemp skips Georgia Senate race,Trump also discussed his plans to impose tariffs on imported movies and reopen Alcatraz prison in California.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-nfl-draft-tariffs-immigration-doge-live-updates-rcna204587,"Raquel Coronell Uribe In a Truth Social post tonight, Trump called for former Colorado county clerk Tina Peters to be released from prison and said he was directing the Justice Department to take ""all necessary action"" to help secure her release. Peters, who has peddled 2020 election conspiracy theories, was sentenced to nine years in prison by a Colorado state judge in October for official misconduct after a security breach of her county’s election equipment. She was convicted after she used another person’s security badge to give an associate of Mike Lindell access to her county’s voting systems, which resulted in secure information’s being posted online. “Colorado must end this unjust incarceration of an innocent American. I am hereby directing the Department of Justice to take all necessary action to help secure the release of this ‘hostage’ being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons. FREE TINA PETERS, NOW!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The Justice Department asked a federal judge in March to consider a petition Peters filed challenging her conviction. The Department of Homeland Security is intensifying its efforts to persuade unauthorized immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and travel assistance. The agency announced today that those who use the CBP Home app to voluntarily leave the United States will receive assistance “to facilitate travel back to their home country” and $1,000 “paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app.” The announcement comes as the number of deportations has remained stagnant during Trump’s first 100 days in office. One of his key campaign promises was that he would enact mass deportations as soon as he took office. DHS did not immediately respond to questions about how the funds would be provided or what proof would be required to show people had returned to their home countries. Read the full story here. Raquel Coronell Uribe Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized Trump’s tariffs in an interview, saying the administration is advancing policies that will “ultimately harm the American economy.” “I do have concerns that with the president’s call for broad-based tariffs against friend and foe alike, that ultimately the administration is advancing policies that are not targeted at countries that have been abusing our trade relationship but rather are essentially new industrial policy and that will result in inflation that will harm consumers and ultimately harm the American economy,” Pence said in an interview that aired tonight on CNN. Pence added that even a minimum 10% tariff would “stifle American growth, limit prosperity, drive up costs for American consumers.” He also commented on Trump's remarks to NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that children should have fewer dolls and fewer pencils, saying keeping toys affordable is “part of the American dream.” In its heyday, Alcatraz Island housed more than 260 prisoners, with notorious gangsters such as Al Capone, George “Machine Gun” Kelly and James “Whitey” Bulger serving time on the rocky outpost. With its closing in 1963 after it fell into disrepair, the federal prison off San Francisco found a new life as a popular tourist destination — one that continues to draw more than a million visitors a year as a national historic landmark. That could all change again if Trump gets his way. Trump wrote yesterday on social media that he is directing the federal Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department and other agencies to “reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz” to the most “ruthless and violent offenders.” But federal corrections experts and historians caution that while such a project may be especially “symbolic” to Trump, any plan would be incredibly expensive and inefficient, particularly when the federal government’s mission is to slash spending and prisons remain strained by staffing shortages. Read the full story here. A former Homeland Security official whom Trump accused of potentially “treasonous” conduct fears he is under federal investigation and plans to challenge what he calls an illegal attempt to silence critics. In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Miles Taylor said that he is prepared to “fight back” in court and that his repeated warnings that Trump would use presidential power to retaliate against perceived political enemies have proved accurate. “My concern was he would turn the government into a revenge machine, and that’s what’s happening,” Taylor said. Since Trump signed a memorandum last month calling for a review of Taylor’s conduct as a Department of Homeland Security official during Trump’s first term, government authorities have contacted former high school classmates and others associated with him, Taylor said. Read the full story here. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today directed a minimum of 20% reduction of four-star service members, as well as a 20% reduction of general officers in the National Guard and an additional 10% reduction in general and flag officers. Most of the affected officers will be eligible for retirement. Hegseth has argued that too many generals and admirals lead to wasteful spending and too much bureaucratic decision-making. “The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring the lethality of U.S. Military Forces to deter threats and, when necessary, achieve decisive victory. To accomplish this mission, we must cultivate exceptional senior leaders who drive innovation and operational excellence, unencumbered by unnecessary bureaucratic layers that hinder their growth and effectiveness,” the memo said. Scott Wong Reporting from Washington Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said tonight that she won’t seek the top Democratic post on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the panel that would be in the strongest position to investigate the Trump administration if Democrats were to win back the chamber next year. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., ran for the coveted position in December but was defeated by a more senior member of the committee, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. Last week, though, Connolly said that because his esophageal cancer had returned he would not seek re-election to Congress and would be stepping back from his day-to-day responsibilities on the Oversight panel. After speaking to colleagues, Ocasio-Cortez said tonight that she believed another bid for the post would be an uphill climb against another more senior member. “It’s actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe I’ll be staying put at Energy and Commerce,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters, referring to a separate committee.

It is the first time the Trump administration has formally weighed in on the lawsuit. NBC News’ Gabe Gutierrez reports on the context of the case. Kyle Stewart Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said today that she will block the House Financial Services and Agriculture committees from holding a joint hearing on crypto tomorrow, adding that the Democrats will walk out and hold their own hearing “to discuss Trump’s ties to crypto and blatant abuses of power.” Waters is the top Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, meaning her consent is needed for the panel to hold a joint hearing with another committee. The Agriculture subcommittee on commodity markets, digital assets and rural development and the Financial Services subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology and artificial intelligence are scheduled to hold a hearing at 10 a.m. tomorrow titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: A Blueprint for the 21st Century.” Trump met with Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina today, who thanked Trump and the U.S. government in a video clip on X for bringing her home after she spent time in a Russian jail. “President Trump, I’m so grateful for you to bring me home. I’m here with your team today and feeling overwhelmed with all the great feelings. Feeling that I’m going to be home soon. And thank you and the government for bringing me home. It’s a lot of feelings which I would want to express. But the biggest one, I’m so proud and so blessed to be American citizen today. Thank you very much,” Karelina said in the video. White House adviser Margo Martin posted a video of the two meeting earlier today during which Karelina told Trump about how long she had been in jail. Karelina was released last month. She had been detained by Russia’s Federal Security Service in January 2024 while she was visiting family in Russia and was sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony for committing “high treason.” The FSB did not provide details of her alleged crime; a Russian legal group said she had donated more than $50 to a group that sends aid to Ukraine. Daniel Arkin Jon Voight has submitted a “comprehensive plan” to Trump mapping out ways to boost domestic film and television production, the Oscar-winning actor’s manager announced today. Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, met with Trump over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, according to a news release. Voight and Paul pitched their suite of ideas, including federal tax incentives, changes to various tax codes, co-production treaties with foreign countries and infrastructure subsidies for production companies and theater owners. The meeting took place before Trump called for duties on “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” decrying other nations for offering financial incentives that have lured producers away. Trump’s Truth Social post last night was met with a mix of confusion and fear by the entertainment industry. White House officials clarified today that “no final decisions” had been made and that they were “exploring all options.” It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s proposal would also apply to TV productions or exactly what part of physical production would be tariffed.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted Trump over his comments to NBC News in an interview that aired yesterday in which he said he didn't know whether he has to uphold the Constitution. “It’s appalling. He doesn’t know if he’s supposed to uphold the Constitution? He swore an oath to that effect; he might have forgotten that,” Schumer said on the Senate floor this afternoon. “It’s hard to imagine something more un-American than Donald Trump, the sitting president, saying he doesn’t know whether he needs to uphold the Constitution,” he said. “One of the traits of a dictator is someone hostile to all forms of guardrails and accountability, who doesn’t want to hear any dissent. Well, the Constitution is the ultimate guardrail, and Donald Trump thinks he doesn’t need to obey it,” Schumer added. Raquel Coronell Uribe Trump signed an executive order this afternoon that the White House said was designed to “promote domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.” “It streamlines the permitting processes that go into building domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing sites. It centers a lot of the environmental permitting process that is quite significant within the EPA, and it takes other actions designed to ensure that we’re bringing pharmaceutical jobs and pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States of America,” a White House aide told Trump about the content of the order before he signed it. The White House has not yet released the text of the order. TeleMessage, the app that Trump’s former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, appeared to use to archive his group chats, has suspended all services after hackers claimed to have stolen files from it. A spokesperson for Smarsh, the company that owns TeleMessage, said today that the company “is investigating a potential security incident. Upon detection, we acted quickly to contain it and engaged an external cybersecurity firm to support our investigation.” “Out of an abundance of caution, all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended,” the spokesperson said.

Brian Kemp to run against Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in 2026, said “obviously we’re disappointed” that Kemp decided against running. “He, of course, would have been a great candidate, but as I’ve said before, that race is going to be competitive either way,"" Thune said. Thune said “there’s a lot of interest” among Republicans in the state in running for the nomination, but when NBC News asked whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene could win a statewide race in Georgia, he said, “I don’t know the answer to that.” “I mean, obviously that’s up to the people of Georgia, but I know there are several in the House delegation over there that are expressing interest and some other statewides, too,” Thune said. Ben Kamisar The Trump administration has not publicly released any accounting of who funded the transition efforts after he won the 2024 election, blowing past the timeline in which previous administrations have disclosed transition donors, despite having pledged last year to release the names. Unlike other transition efforts, Trump’s most recent transition was not subject to the disclosure requirements or donation limits laid out in federal law. That’s because it chose not to accept public funds for the effort. Otherwise, it would have been required to make those disclosures 30 days after he took office and cap donations at $5,000.

Syedah Asghar House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters today that his timeline of passing a sweeping bill for Trump's agenda could slip past his deadline of Memorial Day. “If it’s not done before Memorial Day, it will be shortly thereafter, but our timetable is on pace, and we’re going to get this done ASAP,” Johnson said. Johnson said a meeting with Trump last Thursday to coordinate on the legislation “was truncated due to other events,” so House Republicans needed more time to hammer out the details. Kyle Stewart Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., announced she will retire at the end of her term this Congress and not seek re-election in 2026. Schakowsky will have served for 14 terms as a member of the House. Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old internet personality, entered the race for Schakowsky’s seat. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced today that he will pass on a run for the Senate in what is expected to be one of the most hotly contested Senate races of the 2026 cycle. “Over the last few weeks, I have had many conversations with friends, supporters, and leaders across the country who encouraged me to run for the US Senate in 2026. I greatly appreciate their support and prayers for our family,"" Kemp said in a statement on X. ""After those discussions, I have decided that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for me and my family.” Kemp was a top recruit of Senate Republicans hoping to win back the seat in Georgia held by Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. His decision to pass will set off a scramble for the Republican nomination. Rebecca Shabad Trump said today that the United States will “help the people of Gaza get some food."" ""People are starving, and we’re going to help them get some food,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office. ""Hamas is making it impossible because they’re taking everything that’s brought in.” Israel's security Cabinet approved a plan to seize all of the Gaza Strip as part of an expanded military operation to defeat Hamas. Israel has blocked humanitarian aid from entering Gaza over the last few months as negotiations have failed to reach another ceasefire. Trump has previously said that the United States would take control of Gaza and that its residents would be moved elsewhere and not allowed to return. Sydney CarruthSydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News. Trump claimed he had “nothing to do” with the artificial intelligence-generated image of him dressed as the pope that he shared on Truth Social and the White House posted on X. “The Catholics loved it,” Trump told a reporter in the White House this afternoon. “I had nothing to do with it. Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the pope, and they put it out on the internet. That’s not me that did it.” Some Catholic leaders condemned the image, which was shared less than a week Pope Francis died. Sydney CarruthSydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News. Trump said he wants to meet with the film and TV industry to discuss his plan for imposing 100% tariffs on films produced outside of the U.S., adding he is “not looking to hurt the industry."" “They have the nice sign and everything’s good, but they don’t do very much. A lot of it’s been taken to other countries, and a big proportion,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after his NFL Draft announcement. “I’m actually going to meet with some because, you know, there’s some advantages, I guess.” Trump added that it’s “shocking” the film industry has moved production operations out of Hollywood to seek lower operating costs. Aria Bendix Twenty state attorneys general sued the Trump administration today over its mass firings and the dismantling of agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. The lawsuit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, alleges that the administration violated hundreds of laws and bypassed congressional authority by endeavoring to consolidate the number of HHS agencies from 28 to 15 and initiating layoffs of around 20,000 employees.

The director of the federal Bureau of Prisons said he has ordered an “immediate assessment” to determine how to renovate and reopen the Alcatraz prison, the notorious maximum security penitentiary off the coast of San Francisco that has not been functional since 1963. “The Bureau of Prisons will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President’s agenda,” the director, William K. Marshall III, said in a statement. “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps. Megan Lebowitz Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the far right group the Proud Boys, said in a post to X yesterday that he met with Trump on Saturday. Tarrio had been facing a sentence of 22 years in federal prison after being convicted of seditious conspiracy for actions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but Trump granted him clemency along with rioters and others convicted of involvement in the attack in one of his first acts of his second term. ""Yesterday, I had the honor of meeting the President of the United States, a moment I never could have imagined in my darkest days,"" Tarrio said in the post. He also praised Trump as ""the greatest president since George Washington."" ""My deepest gratitude goes to my family, my brotherhood, my friends, and every person who fought for justice and helped elect the greatest president since George Washington,"" he wrote. ""Together, we did it."" Adam Edelman Trump’s wide-ranging interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker tackled virtually every major policy issue the White House has touched in the more than three months since he took office again. The pair discussed a broad variety of economic issues, including inflation, his tariffs and cryptocurrency — as well as the question of whether Trump was profiting off the presidency. They also delved into immigration issues during the hour-plus conversation, looking at border crossings, deportations and questions about due process, as well as budget issues, including how much money Trump's Department of Government Efficiency has saved and whether Medicaid will see cuts. Read the full story. In a post on Truth Social this morning Trump said he had just had a ""very good and productive"" phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Their conversation covered ""many subjects, including the War with Russia/Ukraine, all things Syria, Gaza, and more,"" Trump wrote. ""The President invited me to go to Turkey at a future date and, likewise, he will be coming to Washington, D.C. During my four years as President, my relationship with President Erdoğan was excellent,"" Trump wrote. Trump said he looks forward to working with Erdoğan ""on getting the ridiculous, but deadly, War between Russia and Ukraine ended — NOW!” Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump told NBC News he plans to hold several events to celebrate U.S. military victories this year, including a “big, beautiful” military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate Flag Day, which also happens to fall on his birthday. “My birthday happens to be on Flag Day,” Trump told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in a wide-ranging interview at Mar-a-Lago that aired yesterday. “I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday. Somebody put it together. But no, I think we’re going to do something on June 14 maybe or somewhere around there. But I think June 14. It’s a very important day.” Read the full story. The Associated Press SOMERS, N.Y. — Voters in U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler’s suburban New York swing district unloaded a barrage of criticism on the Republican during a raucous town hall last night, peppering him with questions around Trump’s aggressive agenda before devolving into a chaotic chorus of boos as attendees were removed by law enforcement.

The central African nation of Rwanda is in discussions with the Trump administration on a possible deal to accept deported migrants from the United States, the country’s foreign minister said late yesterday. Olivier Nduhungirehe told state broadcaster Rwanda TV that early talks were under way, according to the Reuters news agency. The news followed multiple news reports that the U.S. was seeking an international partnership to deport people, amid an ongoing crackdown on foreign visa holders, student activists and suspected criminal gang members.

Karelina was released from a Russian prison last month after spending more than a year in custody following allegations of financially supporting Ukraine’s military. She was arrested in Russia in February 2024 and sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony after she donated $52 to a charity that sends aid to Ukraine. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump said yesterday he will direct several federal agencies to “reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz,” a facility that for decades was a federal prison and is now a national park. “REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ! For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Jennifer Jett Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had a “very warm and positive conversation” with the president after Albanese was re-elected over the weekend in a race that was driven largely by an anti-Trump backlash. Albanese told reporters in Canberra today that he and Trump would “continue to engage” on tariffs, as well as the AUKUS security agreement, and that “we will engage with each other on a face-to-face basis at some time in the future.” Australia was the second liberal democracy in a week after Canada to hold an election in which the incumbent government made an unlikely comeback amid growing public anger over tariffs and other Trump administration policies. Like his counterpart in Canada, the conservative candidate in Australia, Peter Dutton, not only lost the election, but also lost his seat in Parliament. Trump said earlier that Albanese, who took office in 2022, had been “very nice to me, very respectful to me” and that they have “a very good relationship.” “I have no idea who the other person is that ran against him,” he told reporters at the White House last night. The Associated Press Former Vice President Mike Pence yesterday repeatedly invoked the Constitution and said it is what “binds us all together” after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump’s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The award recognizes Pence “for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,” the JFK Library Foundation said.

Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump announced plans yesterday to implement a 100% tariff on movies made in other countries that are imported to the United States, decrying other nations for offering financial incentives meant to “draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.” “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to foreign films as “messaging and propaganda.” Read the full story. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump offered his clearest indication yet that he will leave the White House at the end of his second term without trying to extend his stay, acknowledging the constraints preventing him from seeking a third term in an exclusive interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Trump also highlighted several other rising stars in the Republican Party he said are capable of carrying the MAGA mantle after he’s finished as the GOP’s elected leader, mentioning not only Vice President JD Vance, but also Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has become a central player in his second administration.

Alexandra Marquez Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that he’d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary. The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that the Amazon was going to begin to list tariff charges on certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to impose 145% tariffs on China. Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: “Sure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them.” Read the full story. Alexandra Marquez Hanna Trudo, who most recently worked as a senior political correspondent at The Hill, is considering jumping into the Democratic primary to replace Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., as Pappas runs for Senate next year. Trudo, who is a New Hampshire native, wrote in a memo that she is ""exploring running"" in the primary in New Hampshire's First District and said that she's moved back to the state since Pappas announced he would run for Senate. ""I haven’t poll tested my pitch,"" Trudo wrote. ""I’m simply writing with the same fire I’ve spit for the past decade: Democrats must be better."" In the memo, Trudo called out Trump and his advisers, including tech mogul Elon Musk, writing, ""Under Donald Trump’s off-brand of authoritarian politics, we are no longer free. Our First Amendment freedoms are being cruelly ripped away by Trump, Elon Musk and other obscenely rich, unelected tech lackeys who have contempt for us."" Trump argued in an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that fulfilling his ambitious campaign promise to rapidly carry out mass deportations may take precedence over giving immigrants the right to due process under the Constitution, as required by courts. A central part of Trump’s agenda has been implementing the “largest deportation operation” in U.S. history, as he vowed during the 2024 campaign. In service of that goal, his administration has pressed the courts to allow the immediate removal of immigrants it accuses of being members of a Venezuelan gang, without giving them a chance to plead their case before a judge.

Japan has no plans to use the possible sale of its than $1 trillion in U.S. Treasury holdings in trade talks with Washington, its finance minister said, clarifying earlier remarks in which he implied that could be used as leverage. “We don’t intend to use the sale of US Treasury bonds as a means of negotiations between Japan and the United States,” Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters in Milan yesterday. Kato had said Friday that Japan’s Treasury holdings could be used as a “card” in tariff negotiations, though he stopped short of threatening to sell them. The U.S. was alarmed last month by a large global sell-off in U.S. Treasury securities after Trump imposed steep tariffs on trading partners around the world, including U.S. ally Japan. Trump is expected to announce an agreement for Washington, D.C., to host the 2027 NFL draft, a person familiar with the plans told NBC News. The aim is for the event to take place on the National Mall. Axios was first to report the news. The NFL declined to comment. Read the full story.

Federal judge says results of North Carolina court race with Democrat ahead must be certified,More than 5.5 million ballots were cast in what has been the country's last undecided race from the general election in November.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/federal-judge-says-results-north-carolina-court-race-democrat-ahead-mu-rcna205013,"RALEIGH, N.C. — Disputed ballots in the still unresolved 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count, a federal judge ruled late Monday, a decision that if upheld would result in an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. U.S. District Judge Richard Myers agreed with Riggs and others who argued it would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution to carry out recent decisions by state appeals courts that directed the removal of potentially thousands of voter ballots deemed ineligible. Myers wrote that votes couldn’t be removed six months after Election Day without damaging due process and equal protection rights of the affected residents. Myers also ordered the State Board of Elections to certify results that after two recounts showed Riggs the winner — by just 734 votes — over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin. But the judge delayed his decisions for seven days in case Griffin wants to appeal the ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Follow live politics coverage here The board “must not proceed with implementation of the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court’s orders, and instead must certify the results of the election for (the seat) based on the tally at the completion of the canvassing period,” wrote Myers, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump. More than 5.5 million ballots were cast in what has been the nation’s last undecided race from November’s general election. Griffin, himself a state Court of Appeals judge, filed formal protests after the election in hopes that removing ballots he said were unlawfully cast would flip the outcome to him. Griffin’s legal team was reviewing Myers’ order Monday night and evaluating the next steps, Griffin campaign spokesperson Paul Shumaker wrote in an email. Riggs was more assured in her statement: “Today, we won. I‘m proud to continue upholding the Constitution and the rule of law as North Carolina’s Supreme Court Justice.” Griffin wanted Myers to leave undisturbed the state courts’ decisions, which also directed that most of the voters with otherwise ineligible ballots get 30 days to provide identifying information for their race choices to remain in the tally. Riggs, the state Democratic Party and some affected voters said Griffin was trying to change the 2024 election outcome after the fact by removing ballots cast by voters who complied with voting rules as they were written last fall. Myers wrote that Griffin’s formal protests after the election, which were rejected by the State Board of Elections, constituted efforts to make retroactive changes to the voting laws that would arbitrarily disenfranchise only the voters who were targeted by Griffin. Griffin’s challenges over voters not providing photo identification only covered at most six Democratic-leaning counties in the state. “You establish the rules before the game. You don’t change them after the game is done,” Myers wrote in a 68-page order. “Permitting parties to ‘upend the set rules’ of an election after the election has taken place can only produce ‘confusion and turmoil’” that “‘threatens to undermine public confidence in the federal courts, state agencies, and the elections themselves,’” he added while citing other cases. Democrats and voting rights groups raised alarm about Griffin’s efforts. They called it an attack on democracy that would serve as a road map for the GOP to reverse election results in other states. The state Republican Party said Griffin was seeking to ensure that only legal votes are counted. One category of ballots that state appeals courts declared violated the state constitution were cast by overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. but whose parents were declared North Carolina residents. A state law passed in 2011 had authorized these persons to vote in state elections. The other category covered military or overseas voters who didn’t provide copies of photo identification or an ID exception form with their absentee ballots. A state rule exempted them from the requirement. The appeals courts had permitted a “cure” process for the voters who didn’t provide IDs so their ballots could still count in the race. While North Carolina can certainly establish rules for future state elections, Myers wrote, they can’t be applied after the fact to only a select group of voters. Griffin filed formal protests that appeared to cover more than 65,000 ballots. Ensuing state court rulings whittled down the total to as few as 1,675 ballots or perhaps as many as 7,000, according to court filings. Riggs is one of only two Democrats on the seven-member state Supreme Court, and winning an eight-year term would improve the party’s efforts to retake a majority on the court later in the decade. Griffin and Riggs have not participated in deliberations in their respective courts about their election. The Associated Press"
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won't seek the top Democratic seat on the House Oversight Committee,"After speaking to colleagues, the progressive New York congresswoman said she believed Democrats would favor a more senior member in the role, as they did in the previous race.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/aoc-wont-seek-top-democratic-seat-house-oversight-committee-rcna205002,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Monday night that she won’t seek the top Democratic post on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the panel that would be in the strongest position to investigate the Trump administration if Democrats were to win back the chamber next year. Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, ran for the coveted position in December but was defeated by a more senior member of the committee, Gerry Connolly, of Virginia. Last week, though, Connolly said that because his esophageal cancer had returned, he wouldn’t seek re-election to Congress and would step back from his day-to-day responsibilities on the Oversight panel. After having spoken to colleagues, Ocasio-Cortez said Monday that she believed another bid for the post would be an uphill climb against another more senior member. “It’s actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe I’ll be staying put at Energy and Commerce,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters, referring to a separate committee. She had no comment on whom she might support in the Oversight race. “There’s no vacancy. There’s no official race yet, so I won’t comment on that, and I want to be respectful of ranking member Connolly,” she said. Follow live politics coverage here It's a surprising turn given that Ocasio-Cortez, who has been attracting thousands of supporters at speeches around the country and has been floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said just days ago that she was weighing a bid to secure the post. If Democrats retake the House in 2026, the Oversight chair's gavel could have provided her with an enormous platform and authority to investigate the Trump administration. Because she left the Oversight panel to take a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Ocasio-Cortez would have needed a waiver from the Democratic Caucus to return to Oversight. But several colleagues said they believed she would have been the prohibitive favorite for the job had she decided to run. In December, Connolly beat back a challenge from Ocasio-Cortez in a 131-84 vote by House Democrats. She said Monday that she doesn't believe the result would be much different if she squared off against a different member with more seniority. Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., is the third most senior member on the panel and is filling in for Connolly on an interim basis. Lynch announced last week that he will run for the Oversight job and that Connolly has endorsed him. In addition to Lynch, other Democrats have been reaching out to colleagues about possibly running for the position, including Kweisi Mfume, of Maryland; Maxwell Frost, of Florida; and Jasmine Crockett, of Texas.

Trump administration says Harvard will receive no new grants until it meets White House demands,The president has threatened to end the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status as an educational institution.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-says-harvard-will-receive-no-new-grants-meets-whi-rcna205003,"WASHINGTON — Harvard University will receive no new federal grants until it meets a series of demands from President Donald Trump’s administration, the Education Department announced Monday. The action was laid out in a letter to Harvard’s president and amounts to a major escalation of Trump’s battle with the Ivy League school. The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, and Trump is pushing to strip the school of its tax-exempt status. Harvard has pushed back on the administration’s demands, setting up a closely watched clash in Trump’s attempt to force change at universities that he says have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism. In a press call, an Education Department official said Harvard will receive no new federal grants until it “demonstrates responsible management of the university” and satisfies federal demands on a range of subjects. It applies to federal research grants and not federal financial aid students receive to help cover tuition and fees. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the decision on a call with reporters. Follow live politics coverage here The official accused Harvard of “serious failures” in four areas: antisemitism, racial discrimination, abandonment of rigor and viewpoint diversity. To become eligible for new grants, Harvard would need to enter negotiations with the federal government and prove it has satisfied the administration’s demands. The administration has demanded a series of changes to campus policy, including reforms to crack down on protesters and pursue more viewpoint diversity among faculty. In a letter Monday to Harvard’s president, Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the school of enrolling foreign students who showed contempt for the U.S. “Harvard University has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,” McMahon wrote. Harvard’s president has previously said he will not bend to government’s demands. The university sued to halt its funding freeze last month. Harvard’s suit called the funding freeze “arbitrary and capricious,” saying it violated its First Amendment rights and the statutory provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Trump administration said previously that Harvard would need to meet a series of conditions to keep almost $9 billion in grants and contracts. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has an endowment of $53 billion, the largest in the country. Across the university, federal money accounted for 10.5% of revenue in 2023, not counting financial aid such as grants and student loans. The Associated Press"
Jon Voight met with Trump before president proposed tariffs on foreign film productions,"Voight, whom Trump tapped as one of three special ambassadors to the film industry, said the president “will help us make Hollywood great again.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jon-voight-hollywood-plan-donald-trump-tariffs-rcna204968,"Jon Voight has submitted a “comprehensive plan” to President Donald Trump mapping out ways to boost domestic film and television production, the Oscar-winning actor’s manager announced Monday. Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, met with Trump over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, according to a news release. Voight and Paul pitched their suite of ideas, including federal tax incentives, changes to various tax codes, co-production treaties with foreign countries and infrastructure subsidies for production companies and theater owners. The meeting took place before Trump called for duties on “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” decrying other nations for offering financial incentives that have lured producers away. Trump's Truth Social post Sunday night was met with a mix of confusion and fear by the entertainment industry. White House officials clarified Monday that “no final decisions” had been made and that they were “exploring all options.” It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s proposal would also apply to TV productions or and exactly what part of physical production would be tariffed. Voight and Paul’s proposal includes what the two characterize as “tariffs in certain limited circumstances.” The news release otherwise does not mention tariffs. Voight is one of three stars Trump tapped to be “special ambassadors to Hollywood,” which Trump has called a “great but very troubled place.” The two others are Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone. In a statement, Voight said in part: “The President loves the entertainment business and this country, and he will help us make Hollywood great again.” “We look forward to working with the administration, the unions, studios, and streamers to help form a plan to keep our industry healthy and bring more productions back to America,” he added. “By creating the right environment through smart incentives, updated policies, and much-needed support, we can ensure that American production companies thrive, more jobs stay here at home, and Hollywood once again leads the world in creativity and innovation."" In recent years, the American film industry has suffered a series of economic blows. Covid and two labor strikes upended the content pipeline. Physical production has declined in California amid budget cuts and more generous tax incentives elsewhere. Voight is known for his conservative political views. He is one of Trump’s highest-profile celebrity backers, having once called him “the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.” Voight won the Academy Award for best actor for the Vietnam war drama “Coming Home” (1978) and starred in the best picture winner “Midnight Cowboy” (1969). He is also known for his roles in films such as “Deliverance,” “Mission: Impossible” and “Ali.” Paul is a producer, actor and talent manager who founded the independent production company Crystal Sky Pictures.

In today’s edition, we break down a key development in the 2026 battle for the Senate majority.

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Republicans were dealt a major blow in their bid to expand their Senate majority on Monday, with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp passing a run against the party’s top target for defeat, Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. As Bridget Bowman and Sahil Kapur report, Kemp was viewed as the GOP’s leading recruit in Georgia, one of two states President Donald Trump carried in 2024 with a Democratic-held Senate seat that’s up in 2026. The other is Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring. The background: Kemp has shown a rare ability to appeal to both conservative and middle-of-the-road voters. After Kemp opposed efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, Trump backed former Sen. David Perdue in the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary. But Kemp easily defeated Perdue before going on to win re-election by nearly 8 points over Stacey Abrams, just two years after Joe Biden became the first Democrat to carry Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. Plan B: It’s unclear what Kemp’s next steps will be, as he’s unable to seek re-election next year due to term limits. But his decision to forgo a Senate run will likely spark a crowded and competitive GOP primary to take on Ossoff. Multiple members of Georgia’s congressional delegation — including Reps. Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Mike Collins and Marjorie Taylor Greene — have suggested they would consider a bid if Kemp did not run. Greene indicated to NBC News last week that she’s weighing a Senate run. “I have just a lot of options open to me,” she said. Among other statewide elected Republicans, Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and Insurance Commissioner John King are also seen as potential candidates. The map: Ultimately, the Georgia seat will likely be more important to Democrats as they try to eat into the GOP’s 53-47 majority. In addition to Michigan, Democrats also have open seats to defend in Minnesota and New Hampshire. And the party’s offensive opportunities are relatively limited, with Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina seen as the most vulnerable Republicans. Read more from Bridget and Sahil → Over in the House: Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., announced she will not seek re-election next year after serving 14 terms in the House. Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old internet personality, had already entered the race for Schakowsky’s safe Democratic seat. The Department of Homeland Security is spending big bucks — almost $21 million so far, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact — on an ad campaign featuring Secretary Kristi Noem heaping praise on President Donald Trump and calling on immigrants in America illegally to “leave now.” It’s an amount of money that’s in line with what a prominent statewide campaign might spend, according to AdImpact. By comparison, liberal candidate Susan Crawford spent $28 million on ads while conservative candidate Brad Schimel spent $15 million during last month’s closely watched Wisconsin Supreme Court election. In last year’s election, Pennsylvania Republican Dave McCormick spent $21 million on ads in one of the most competitive Senate races on the battleground map. The vast majority of the DHS spots feature Noem speaking directly to the camera, touting Trump and warning, “If you are here illegally, we will find you and we will deport you. You will never return. But if you leave now, you may have an opportunity to return.” Other variations include Noem blasting “weak politicians” for leaving “our borders wide open,” while others feature her speaking in English with Spanish subtitles. Other more targeted ads show Noem detailing a list of “illegal aliens caught because of President Trump’s leadership.” Some spots also feature footage of arrests and from her visit to the El Salvador prison where deported Venezuelans are being held. The ads are broadly targeted to newscasts like morning and nightly news shows on major broadcast networks, and Spanish-language channels. The federal government has spent billions in taxpayer funds over the years on advertising campaigns, including on those to highlight government programs or encourage recruitment. Healthcare.gov, the federal health care exchange, has benefitted from tens of millions of dollars in advertising over the years, with the Obama administration running ads to encourage sign-ups (including in red states). The Biden administration also spent $50 million to note how the 2021 Covid relief law created new subsidies for health insurance. But what’s particularly notable about the new DHS ad campaign is how heavily Noem, a former South Dakota governor who, at 53, could have a long political career ahead of her, is featured. And soon, Noem won’t be the only Trump administration official whose agency spends tens of millions of dollars to broadcast its message on the airwaves. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to launch his own public relations effort, according to a document obtained by NBC News that says the campaign would include up to three ads a day across major TV networks.

Trump hasn't said who funded his presidential transition effort despite pledging to disclose donors,The White House didn't respond to multiple questions about when the transition would disclose who funded it.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-not-said-funded-presidential-transition-effort-pledging-disclose-rcna204785,"President Donald Trump’s administration has not publicly released any accounting of who funded the transition efforts after he won the 2024 election, blowing past the timeline in which previous administrations have disclosed transition donors, despite pledging last year to release the names. Unlike other transition efforts, Trump’s most recent transition was not subject to the disclosure requirements or donation limits laid out in federal law. That's because it chose not to accept public funds for the effort. Otherwise, it would have been required to make those disclosures 30 days after taking office and cap donations at $5,000. Still, the Trump transition team said in a November statement that “donors to the transition will be disclosed to the public,” and those disclosures have not yet been made. The White House did not reply to multiple questions from NBC News about when the transition team would release a list of its donors. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, was the spokesperson for the president’s transition. Rules regarding presidential transition funding are governed by the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. Most of the law outlines how nominees and presidents-elect are able to get a jump start on the massive change from campaigning to governing a federal bureaucracy, laying out topics like what can be done before or after the election, how the transition team can work with the outgoing administration and what should be spelled out in a transition team’s ethics plan. But the act also includes guardrails for how these efforts are funded, both publicly and privately. The federal government allows presidents-elect to tap into a pool of millions of dollars for transitions, including for securing office space and hiring staff. It also allows for private donations, capped at $5,000 per donor. But the donation cap and the requirement to lay out the transition team’s donors are contingent on accepting the public funding in the first place. If a transition doesn’t take public dollars, then it doesn't need to follow those rules. That’s what the Trump transition decided to do, in a break with tradition. In a November news release announcing that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the outgoing administration, the Trump transition team disclosed it would “utilize private funding ... providing cost savings to the American taxpayers.” Left unsaid was that the decision unshackled the Trump team from those disclosure requirements and fundraising limits. But the Trump transition did add that “donors to the Transition will be disclosed to the public” and “the Transition will not accept foreign donations.” The novel decision by the Trump transition to eschew public funding, placing it outside the purview of disclosure law and donation caps, prompted some experts to question whether the law needs to be strengthened to mandate disclosure in more cases. “The Presidential Transition Act assumes that candidates want to accept the services of government agencies before the election, before inauguration,” Valerie Smith Boyd told NBC News in February when she was the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. She’s no longer with the organization. “The transparency requirements are tied to accepting those services. There is a new question as to whether that is the right recipe in the law,” she added. Trump’s transition ahead of his first term agreed to accept public funding and raised an additional $6.5 million and spent almost $4.7 million, according to a report filed with the General Services Administration in February 2017. While donations have to be specifically itemized, the only information typically disclosed about spending is how much was spent in certain categories, such as payroll, travel and legal expenses.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp passes on running for a key Democratic-held Senate seat,"Kemp, a Republican, was considered a strong potential candidate. Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for re-election in 2026 in a state Trump carried last year.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/georgia-gov-brian-kemp-passes-running-key-democratic-held-senate-seat-rcna204926,"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has decided not to run for the Senate next year, dealing a blow to Republicans who viewed him as a top recruit. The state is a major target for Republicans as they look to expand their three-seat Senate majority. Georgia is one of two states, along with Michigan, where Democrats are defending a seat in a state that President Donald Trump won in November. Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for re-election in Georgia, while Sen. Gary Peters is retiring in Michigan. Kemp, who is in his second term and cannot run for re-election as governor because of term limits, said in a statement on X that a Senate run is ""not the right decision for me and my family. ""I spoke with President Trump and Senate leadership earlier today and expressed my commitment to work alongside them to ensure we have a strong Republican nominee who can win next November,"" Kemp wrote, ""and ultimately be a conservative voice in the US Senate who will put hardworking Georgians first."" Kemp's decision could spark a competitive GOP primary to take on Ossoff, who won his seat in a dramatic Jan. 5, 2021, runoff following the 2020 general election. Multiple members of Georgia's congressional delegation — including Reps. Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Mike Collins and Marjorie Taylor Greene — have suggested they would consider a bid if Kemp did not run. Greene, the far-right congresswoman, indicated to NBC News last week that she is considering a Senate run. “I have just a lot of options open to me,” she said, without engaging on whether she is being encouraged to run or actively making calls about it. “Not really discussing it at this time,” she said. Among other statewide elected Republicans, Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper posted on X in February that he met with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Insurance Commissioner John King told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution late last year that he would “take a hard look” at a Senate run — if Kemp stayed out. Republicans expressed confidence that they were in a strong position to flip the seat, even without Kemp as their nominee. ""While Jon Ossoff is running to impeach President Trump, Republicans have a number of strong candidates who can build a winning coalition to add this seat to President Trump's Senate Majority,"" NRSC spokeswoman Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement, referring to Ossoff's recent comments that Trump “has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.” Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman Maeve Coyle said Kemp's decision is ""yet another embarrassing Republican Senate recruitment failure as they face a building midterm backlash where every GOP candidate will be forced to answer for Trump’s harmful agenda. Senate Republicans’ toxic agenda and recruitment failures put their majority at risk in 2026."" Republicans had viewed Kemp as a top contender if he ran against Ossoff, with the NRSC chair, Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, openly calling him his party's ""No. 1 recruit"" in an interview with Semafor in January. Kemp won his second term in 2022 by nearly 8 percentage points, winning more than 53% of the vote in a race against Democrat Stacey Abrams two years after President Joe Biden narrowly carried the state. Kemp also easily fended off a primary challenge in 2022 from GOP former Sen. David Perdue, who had Trump's endorsement. Trump targeted Kemp for opposing Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, vowing to campaign against him and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who also defeated a Trump-backed challenger in 2022. Kemp's strong performance in that primary showed that he was able to maintain support from the party's conservative base of supporters. After Kemp endorsed Trump's presidential run last year, Trump thanked him ""for all of your help and support in Georgia."" Kemp was first elected governor in 2018, beating Abrams by around 1 point in a banner year for Democrats. Bridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.

Trump announces the 2027 NFL draft will be in Washington,The president said that the draft would be held on the National Mall.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-set-announce-2027-nfl-draft-will-washington-possibly-national-ma-rcna204753,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Monday that the 2027 NFL draft would be held in Washington, D.C. on the National Mall. ""The draft is a celebration of one of our country's most cherished cultural institutions, and the annual highlights for football fans everywhere,"" Trump said. ""Everyone in the world is going to be watching."" Trump made the announcement from the Oval Office, flanked by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris, among other officials. The three spoke briefly, and Bowser touted the draft's ability to bring business to the city. ""We believe in investing in sports because they have helped us transform neighborhoods, and the NFL bringing this event to the nation's capital will help us fill hotel rooms, our restaurants, and Americans from all 50 states will come to their nation's capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums,"" Bowser said. NBC News previously reported that the announcement was expected. Axios was first to report the expected announcement. The NFL declined to comment on Sunday. The NFL draft is an annual selection of the top college football players by individual teams. To be eligible, players must have been out of high school for at least three years. From 1965 to 2014, the draft took place in New York City, but it has since rotated to different host cities. More than 600,000 people were on site in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last month for the most recent three-day event. The announcement comes as Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser went public last week with plans to return to Washington and build a new stadium after 27 years in Maryland. The president praised the plans, saying in the Oval Office that he did not think ""there is a better site anywhere in the world than that site."" Trump, who once owned a United States Football League team and aspired (but failed) to own an NFL franchise, followed the 2025 draft from afar. He criticized NFL owners on social media for not taking Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders in the first round. “What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be ‘picked’ IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!” Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was expected to be a top pick but fell to the fifth round before he was taken by the Cleveland Browns. The president has a history of sparring with the NFL. During his first term, he called on owners to fire players who were kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice and other issues and claimed the protests were hurting the league's television ratings and ticket sales. At a Sept. 2017 rally, Trump said, “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a b---- off the field right now? Out! He’s fired. He’s fired.'"" In a statement that did not mention Trump by name, Goodell referred to the president's comments as “divisive” and said they showed “an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.” Trump then shot back at Goodell, saying, ""Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country. Tell them to stand!"" The president doubled down on his criticism of anthem protests during a 2018 Fox News interview, saying ""maybe"" people who protested during the national anthem ""shouldn't be in the country.""

"DHS to pay $1,000 to undocumented immigrants who self-deport","The Department of Homeland Security announced it will provide travel assistance and a $1,000 stipend to those who use the CBP Home App to leave the United States.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-pay-1000-undocumented-immigrants-deport-rcna204859,"The Department of Homeland Security is intensifying its efforts to persuade unauthorized immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and travel assistance. The federal agency announced Monday that those who use the CBP Home app to voluntarily leave the United States will receive assistance ""to facilitate travel back to their home country"" and $1,000 ""paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app."" The announcement comes as the number of deportations has remained stagnant during President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. One of the president's key campaign promises was that he would enact mass deportations as soon as he took office. DHS did not immediately respond to questions about how the funds would be provided or what proof would be required to show the person had returned to their home country. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in late March that those who are self-deporting can use biographical data, documents, facial images and geo location in the app to prove that they have left the country. “The alien must be at least three miles outside of the United States to successfully utilize this feature,” she said. “While the use of the verify departure functionality is optional, if the alien chooses to use it, they must submit a facial image. It's required.” In a press release, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said self-deportations are ""the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest."" A single deportation costs U.S. taxpayers $17,121, according to DHS. The federal agency expects self-deportations to decrease that cost by 70%, even after factoring in the stipend. So far this year, at least 5,000 immigrants have reportedly used CBP Home to say that they were voluntarily leaving the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank. DHS has declined to say how many unauthorized immigrants have used the app so far to self-deport. According to Appfigures, a company that tracks app downloads, CBP Home app has recently been downloaded about 1,500 times per day. Since the start of 2025, the app was downloaded about 300,000 times, according to the company’s CEO, Ariel Michaeli. In March, the Trump administration repurposed the Biden-era CBP One app that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally as asylum-seekers, changing it into the CBP Home app. This version of the mobile application has a self-deportation reporting feature. The Trump administration has spent $200 million in revamping the app and creating an accompanying advertising campaign featuring Noem to promote the app's use. The ads, which have aired in English and Spanish across the U.S. and Mexico, encourage immigrants who are not legally present in the U.S. to leave the country. As part of their announcement Monday, DHS said that undocumented immigrants who ""submit their intent to voluntarily self-deport in CBP Home will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure."" The agency also said that self-deportation through the app ""may help preserve the option for an illegal alien to re-enter the United States legally in the future,"" echoing key points Noem touts in her ads. Immigration experts and advocates have previously warned of Noem’s self-deportation message and the possibility of being able to legally return to the U.S. “The operative word in that quote from the secretary is ‘may,’” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, told NBC News in March. “For many people who leave the United States, there may never be a lawful option for return to the United States, or reentry may be barred for many years,” Heidi Altman, the vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization, told NBC News in a statement in March. “Forcing or coercing people into leaving their homes and their loved ones carries political, moral, and economic costs.” Nicole Acevedo is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.

Trump set to raise millions from crypto and meme coin this month,"The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/trump-set-raise-millions-crypto-meme-coin-month-rcna204847,"President Donald Trump has two crypto-focused dinners on the calendar this month — one aimed at deep-pocketed political donors, the other at meme coin millionaires. Both are poised to help him rake in millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory. The second, on May 22, offers access to Trump’s inner circle not for cash — but for holders of the $TRUMP token. Hosted by MAGA Inc., the “Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner” on May 5 features special guest David Sacks — who has been helping to rewrite the country’s crypto and artificial intelligence rules. The committee receiving the funds, MAGA Inc., is a super PAC that supports Trump. But given that the president is constitutionally barred from running for a third term, it’s unclear how the PAC plans to spend the millions of dollars it is raising this spring at a series of dinners. The crypto community has cheered Sacks’ growing influence in Washington, crediting him and other Trump-aligned appointees with a sweeping policy shift that’s already delivered a spate of regulatory wins across multiple federal agencies — in what many industry executives are describing as a 180 pivot from President Joe Biden. The second gala dinner will be held later this month at Trump National, the president’s private club in the Washington, D.C., area. The guest list will be decided by a blockchain-based contest run by the creators of the $TRUMP meme token. Instead of cash, entry is based on how many tokens a user holds, with the top 220 promised dinner with Trump himself. The contest runs through May 12. The gala, which is black tie optional, offers a “VIP White House Tour” and special reception to the meme coin’s 25-biggest holders. The website hosts an active leaderboard displaying the usernames of the coin’s top buyers. Accountable.US, a center-left watchdog group that investigates corporate and political influence, described the leaderboard contest as “the most nakedly corrupt self-enrichment scheme in U.S. presidential history,” warning it opens the door for wealthy donors — including potentially foreign actors — to buy access to the president, while personally enriching the Trump family. Because crypto wallets are pseudonymous, unless a holder has publicly disclosed their wallet address, it is difficult to independently confirm the identities of the top token holders currently leading the contest. In January, for example, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun upped his token stake in another Trump-related crypto project. The Tron blockchain founder disclosed that he holds $75 million worth of World Liberty Financial’s token. A court filing the following month showed that Sun and the Securities and Exchange Commission were exploring a resolution to the regulator’s civil fraud case against the crypto entrepreneur. The fine print of the $TRUMP contest does not guarantee access to the president. According to the site’s terms and conditions, Trump may not be able to attend and the event can be canceled “for any reason.” In that case, they’ll get a Trump NFT instead. Still, the contest has supercharged demand for the coin — and lined the pockets of its creators. The $TRUMP token surged more than 50% after the gala was announced, boosting the paper value of wallets controlled by insiders and early backers. Roughly 80% of the $TRUMP token supply is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliates, according to the project’s website. Since the token launched in January, trading activity has generated more than $324 million in trading fees for insiders, Chainalysis found. These fees are generated through the token’s built-in mechanism that routes a percentage of each trade to wallets controlled by the project — wallets that, according to the website, are linked to the coin’s creators. Insiders have agreed, however, to delay cashing out their share of tokens for at least another 90 days, according to the project’s public disclosures.

Trump says he will reopen 'enlarged and rebuilt' Alcatraz prison,Alcatraz Island hasn't been used as a federal penitentiary since 1963. It had a capacity of roughly 300 people.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-says-will-reopen-enlarged-rebuilt-alcatraz-prison-rcna204743,"President Donald Trump said Sunday he will direct several federal agencies to ""reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz,"" a facility that for decades was a federal prison and is now a national park. ""REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ! For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders,"" he added. Alcatraz Island, a former military fortress and prison in San Francisco Bay, was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and over the course of 29 years housed more than 1,500 people ""deemed difficult to incarcerate elsewhere in the federal prison system,"" according to the National Park Service. According to a National Park Service study, it was initially deemed unfit to serve as a federal institution because of its small size, isolated location and lack of fresh water. However, Sanford Bates, the director of the Bureau of Prisons in 1933, later found it ""an ideal place of confinement for about 200 of the most desperate or irredeemable types."" It was formally opened as a federal penitentiary the next year. Trump suggested in his post that he'd like to restore the facility to that purpose. ""When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be,"" he wrote. The director of the Bureau of Prisons, William K. Marshall III, said in a statement that his agency ""will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President’s agenda.” “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,"" Marshall said. ""USP Alcatraz has a rich history. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice."" According to the Bureau of Prisons, the average population of Alcatraz during its use was 260 to 275. The facility never reached its capacity of 336 people, and it held less than 1% of the total federal prison population. Trump seemed to suggest the island could be used to house some undocumented immigrants he has been seeking to remove from the country, making a pointed reference in his post to ""judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals who came into our country illegally."" Trump in March sent more than 200 deportees he accused of being Venezuelan gang members to a terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, arguing his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act enabled him to do so, even though a federal judge blocked the effort. A Trump-appointed federal judge last week rejected Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members. Trump decried the judicial rulings in explaining his rationale for reopening the prison Sunday evening, describing Alcatraz as a famous ""symbol of law and order."" ""The judges, so many of these radicalized judges, they want to have trials for every single, think of it, every single person that’s in our country illegally,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday evening. ""That would mean millions of trials, and it’s just so ridiculous what’s happening."" Trump similarly announced an effort in March to detain immigrants he's seeking to deport in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but concerns about the legality and the cost of the move have led the administration to reconsider the plan. The Bureau of Prisons operates at least 120 federal institutions and manages a population of 156,254 people. It is unclear how feasible the move is considering ongoing budget constraints at the Bureau of Prisons, which told a union representing some of its staff members in December that it planned to close several facilities. Alcatraz closed as a penitentiary in 1963, according to the Bureau of Prisons, because of expensive operating costs further heightened by the physical isolation of the island, which meant all food and supplies had to be delivered by boat. ""An estimated $3-5 million was needed just for restoration and maintenance work to keep the prison open. That figure did not include daily operating costs — Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison,"" the Bureau of Prisons wrote of the penitentiary's closing. Nearly a decade later, in 1972, Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, which included Alcatraz Island. The complex opened to the public a year later, and it has gone on to become among the most popular National Park Service sites, according to the agency, hosting more than 1 million visitors annually. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, whose district includes the island, said Trump's proposal ""is not a serious one,"" noting on X that it is now ""a major tourist attraction."" A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom also downplayed the legitimacy of the idea. “Looks like it’s distraction day again in Washington, D.C.,"" said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, Newsom's deputy director of communication.

"In New York, a GOP congressman is shelled with questions about Trump during raucous town hall","At one point, law enforcement personnel surrounded a woman in the audience and then carried her out. It was unclear what exactly led to her removal.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/new-york-gop-congressman-shelled-questions-trump-raucous-town-hall-rcna204793,"SOMERS, N.Y. — Voters in U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler’s suburban New York swing district unloaded a barrage of criticism on the Republican during a raucous town hall Sunday night, peppering him with questions around President Donald Trump’s aggressive agenda before devolving into a chaotic chorus of boos as attendees were removed by law enforcement. The town hall in Somers, a leafy section of Lawler’s Hudson Valley district, began to teeter off the rails soon after it began. The first crack emerged when Lawler, in his opening remarks, told the packed-out prep school auditorium “This is what democracy looks like.” Laughter crept through the crowd. A little while later, the congressman’s mention of federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. drew loud jeers. “So you want, for instance, petroleum-based dyes to continue?” Lawler asked in response. Republicans, in some instances, have made themselves scarce in their home districts following President Donald Trump’s first few months in office, as party leadership expresses wariness of viral blowback against Republicans in vulnerable seats. Lawler, a moderate who last year won a second term and has openly expressed interest in running for governor, has instead sought to put himself in front of voters, holding a previous town hall late last month and has plans for more in the coming weeks. On Sunday, Lawler’s staff required people to RSVP and set up a series of ground rules, including that attendees live in the district, not record at the event, refrain from shouting or standing, and “be respectful of one another, of staff, and of the Congressman,” a sign at the door read. At one point, as Lawler was responding to a question about tariffs, security and law enforcement began to surround a woman in the upper stretch of the auditorium. The crowd chanted “let her stay, let her stay” before law enforcement picked her up and carried her out. It was unclear what exactly led to her removal. “Shame! Shame! Shame!” the audience yelled. Lawler tried to get back on track: “Folks, tariffs are way more complicated than you want to make them.” The crowd groaned. “Folks, enough!” Lawler said above the din. Soon after, another person was removed. Then another. In the audience, Jeanette Spoor, a 74-year-old retiree, said she wanted to ask Lawler about the future of Social Security and Medicaid but wasn’t called on during the nearly two-hour event. “You’re not helping your constituents if you’re making it hard for them to get help,” she said in an interview. She added, “I have no hopes for this guy.” Another attendee, Kristi Thompson, 52, said she was bothered by what she said were Lawler’s long-winded answers that didn’t address the substance of the crowd’s questions. “He claims to be available to constituents, but he isn’t,” she said. The crowd walked out during the final question of the night, which was about protests against Israel. Lawler began to answer but cut himself off as the room emptied out. “I appreciate everybody coming out tonight and taking the time to ask your questions and hear my answers, whether you liked them or not, or agreed with them or not, or whether you really actually wanted to listen to them or not, but I very much appreciate you participating,” he said as attendees exited.

Mike Pence receives JFK Profile in Courage Award for Jan. 6 actions,"""By God’s grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America,” former vice president says.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/mike-pence-receives-jfk-profile-courage-award-january-6-actions-rcna204763,"BOSTON — Former Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday repeatedly invoked the Constitution and said it is what “binds us all together” after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump’s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The award recognizes Pence “for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,” the JFK Library Foundation said. “To forge a future together, we have to find common ground,” Pence said. “I hope in some small way my presence here tonight is a reminder that whatever differences we may have as Americans, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand. It’s what binds us across time and generations. .... It’s what makes us one people.” His comments came hours after an interview with Trump aired in which he was asked whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Trump was noncommittal. “I don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know,” Trump said when pressed in an interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker. It was taped Friday at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida and aired Sunday. Pence never mentioned Trump during his 10-minute speech but made several references to the Trump administration. Referencing what he called “these divided times, in these anxious days,” he acknowledged that he probably had differences with the Democrats in the room but also with his own Republican Party “on spending, tariffs and my belief that America is the leader of the free world and must stand with Ukraine until the Russian invasion is repelled and a just and lasting peace is secured.” Trump pressured Pence to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president falsely claimed the vote was marred by fraud. Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority. When a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to “hang Mike Pence.” Pence was whisked away by Secret Service agents, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the rioters. “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,” Trump wrote at the time on X, formerly Twitter, as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building. Pence rejected the Secret Service’s advice that he leave the Capitol, staying to continue the ceremonial election certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential victory once rioters were cleared. In describing his role, Pence told the audience that “by God’s grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America.” “Jan. 6 was a tragic day but it became a triumph of freedom. History will record that our institutions held,” he said in his speech. “Leaders in both chambers, in both political parties reconvened the very same day and finished democracy’s work under the Constitution.” JFK’s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, who along with his grandson Jack Schlossberg presented the award, said Pence’s actions that day were a reminder that democracy must not be taken for granted. “At the time I thought Vice President Pence was just doing his job,” she said. “Only later did I realize that his act of courage saved our government and warned us about what could happen and is happening right now.” The Profile in Courage Award, named for a book Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president, honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences. Previous recipients of the award include former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford. Pence has emerged as one of the few Republicans willing to take on the Trump administration. His political action group, Advancing American Freedom, campaigned against the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation’s health agencies. He’s delivered speeches urging the president to stand with longtime foreign allies and posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” The Associated Press"
Trump announces plans for 100% tariffs on all foreign movies,The president said the new import penalties are an effort to spur the production of feature films in America and revitalize Hollywood.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-announces-new-tariffs-foreign-movies-rcna204747,"President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to implement a 100% tariff on movies made in other countries that are imported to the United States, decrying other nations for offering financial incentives meant to “draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.” ""Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to foreign films as ""messaging and propaganda."" ""I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,"" he continued. Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday that ""other nations have been stealing the movies, the moviemaking capabilities from the United States,"" blaming California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the decline in film production in Hollywood specifically over the last several years. A spokesman for Newsom did not respond to a request for comment Sunday night. ""If they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States, we should have a tariff when movies come in,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you one thing, moviemakers love it."" The American film industry has suffered a series of economic blows in recent years, including the Hollywood labor strikes and the Covid-19 pandemic. Physical production has declined in California amid budget cuts and more generous tax incentives elsewhere. FilmLA, a nonprofit organization that coordinates film permits and supports on-location production in the Los Angeles region, reported lower-than-average soundstage occupancy in recent years. The report notes that competing jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Ontario, Canada, have more than doubled their stage production capacity over the last years, alongside other U.S. states, such as New York and Georgia. However, while overall production was down in Los Angeles, the report found that the production of feature films specifically was up 18.8% last year, though the category is still well below its five-year average. ""Unfortunately for all involved, fewer film, television and commercial projects in production makes it harder to fill studio vacancies,"" the report read. Trump appointed actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone as special ambassadors to Hollywood in January, calling the industry a “great but very troubled place."" Their job, Trump said at the time, was to bring business back to Hollywood, which he said ""has lost much business over the last four years to foreign countries."" Last month, Voight’s manager, Steven Paul, confirmed to NBC News that he and Voight intended to present Trump with a suite of ideas to ramp up American film and television production. It is unclear whether that meeting has occurred. The Motion Picture Association, a trade organization that represents Hollywood’s leading studios, declined to comment. In a recent economic report based on U.S. government data, the MPA found that Hollywood has a positive trade balance in all the world’s major markets. NBC News did not immediately receive responses to requests for comment from Paul; Cinema United, a trade group that represents movie theaters; and several distributors that release foreign-made films, including Netflix. China announced new tariffs on Hollywood films imported into the country about a month ago, though Reuters reports the move was unlikely to have a significant financial impact on Hollywood given steadily declining box office returns from China.

"CIA's top doctor sues over her firing, accusing the government of bowing to the far right","Dr. Terry Adirim, director of the CIA’s Center for Global Health Services, accused the government of denying her due process and bowing to far-right activists.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/cias-top-doctor-suing-agency-firing-lawsuit-says-rcna204656,"The CIA’s former top-ranking doctor is suing it over her firing, accusing the government of denying her due process and bowing to far right activists who singled her out for criticism. The CIA hired Dr. Terry Adirim, director of the CIA’s Center for Global Health Services, after she served as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Just days after Adirim started her job at the CIA last year, far-right commentator Ivan Raiklin accused her of being the “architect” of the Defense Department’s vaccine mandate, which required members of the military to get the Covid-19 vaccine. The lawsuit alleges that Adirim’s hiring at the CIA had not yet been announced publicly and that someone inside the government leaked the information to Raiklin. Raiklin, a former Green Beret who has called himself the “secretary of retribution,” has been an intense critic of the Covid-19 vaccines, calling them “DNA-mutilation injections.” He has demanded retaliation against Pentagon officials who he says were involved in requiring service members to get the Covid-19 vaccines. Raiklin is associated with Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump’s national security adviser at the start of his first term. The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adirim was fired only weeks after she received an email from the CIA’s chief operating officer saying the CIA “looked forward to investing in her career,” according to the lawsuit. That was also two days after Lara Loomer, another far-right conspiracy theorist, paid a visit to the White House and urged that several national security officials be dismissed for alleged disloyalty, according to the lawsuit. Loomer later took credit for the abrupt firing of the director of the National Security Agency, four-star Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, as well as its civilian deputy. “We’re suing CIA to enjoin the Agency from firing Dr. Adirim, and seeking damages for violating her privacy, ignoring her due process rights, and breaching her employment contract,” Adirim’s lawyer, Kevin Carroll, said in a statement. Carroll says in the lawsuit that he will seek to prove through discovery that Raiklin worked with Loomer to secure Adirim’s dismissal.

Trump says he'll call CEOs when he disagrees with their business decisions,Retailers have increasingly offered warnings about the tariffs' impact on consumers.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-call-ceos-plans-prices-tariffs-rcna204702,"President Donald Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that he’d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary. The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was going to begin to list tariff charges on certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to impose 145% tariffs on China. ""He’s just a very nice guy,"" Trump said of Bezos in an interview that aired Sunday. ""We have a relationship. I asked him about [the tariff charge language Amazon considered including in listings]. He said, 'Well, I don’t want to do that,' and he took it off immediately."" Trump and Bezos appear to have developed a closer relationship in the last few months than they had during Trump’s first administration. In December, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Bezos attended his swearing-in ceremony. Bezos stepped down as the company's CEO in 2021, but he is still its executive chairman. Indeed, in a statement shortly after the Punchbowl report, an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News, ""The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen.” Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: ""Sure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them."" ""If I think that somebody’s doing something that’s incorrect, wrong or maybe hurtful to the country, I’ll call,"" he added. ""Wouldn’t you want me to call? [Former President Joe] Biden wouldn’t call because he didn’t know what was happening, but I do."" In the interview, Trump defended his decision to impose major tariffs on imports from China, saying the move is supposed to give companies incentives to build factories in the United States to avoid paying tariffs, not simply raise prices on consumers to offset the cost of tariffs. ""I don’t view it as a tax. I view it as an incentive for people to come into the United States and build plants, factories, offices, a lot of things. I think it’s an incentive,"" he told Welker. ""What people don’t understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. The company eats the tariff. And it’s not passed along at all,"" he added. Several other major online retailers, like Temu, a low-cost retail site based in China, have already begun charging consumers tariff fees, adding a line item on purchases that's listed as “import charges.” Other popular American retailers, like Béis, Bare Necessities and Fashion Nova, have urged consumers to shop more in the near term, predicting that imposing future tariffs could force them to raise prices. Larger companies, like PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, have issued similar warnings, telling shareholders in recent meetings that they're already seeing the impacts of tariffs on earnings. Trump has acknowledged that tariffs could have an impact on the availability of consumer goods in the near term. Asked whether his remark about children having fewer toys during a Cabinet meeting was an acknowledgment that tariffs would cause prices to rise, Trump told Welker: ""I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls, because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable."" Trump made a similar remark at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, telling members of his administration: ""Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” But he pushed back against the assertion that he was predicting price hikes or supply shortages due to tariffs. ""I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,"" he said, adding, ""we don’t have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don’t need, for junk that we don’t need.""

Trump defends the high price tag for his military parade: 'Peanuts compared to the value',"In an exclusive interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Trump also outlined a White House renovation he hopes to carry out — which he said he will pay for himself.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-defends-high-cost-military-parade-peanuts-rcna204581,"President Donald Trump told NBC News he plans to hold several events to celebrate U.S. military victories this year, including a “big, beautiful” military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate Flag Day, which also happens to fall on his birthday. “My birthday happens to be on Flag Day,” Trump told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in a wide-ranging interview at Mar-a-Lago that aired on Sunday. “I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday. Somebody put it together. But no, I think we’re going to do something on June 14 maybe or somewhere around there. But I think June 14. It’s a very important day.” The parade won’t be cheap. Defense officials told NBC News that the estimated cost could be as high as $45 million, with individual Army units ultimately bearing the cost of the parade — which could potentially impact funds used for training. Trump said it would be worth it. “Peanuts compared to the value of doing it,” Trump said of the cost. “We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we’re going to celebrate it.” The event, which will also mark the Army’s 250th birthday, is expected to include 6,600 soldiers, an Army spokesman said. Defense officials familiar with the planning said it is also expected to feature more than 50 aircraft and 150 military vehicles, which could include wheeled vehicles such as Humvees and trucks, and so-called tracked vehicles, like tanks. The military parade is just one of several events Trump said he intends to host this year to mark America’s wartime achievements. Trump said he was inspired after speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron about Victory Day celebrations in Europe commemorating the end of World War II. He said he was considering celebrations on separate days to commemorate the end of the two world wars. Recounting a past conversation with Macron, Trump recalled saying, ""'We had more to do with winning World War II than any other nation. Why don’t we have a Victory Day?' So we’re going to have a Victory Day for World War I and for World War II."" “You know, if you look at Russia, they celebrate Victory Day,” he had previously noted. “I think you can have two days,” Trump said. “This doesn’t mean we’re going to go and not work and have a national holiday and all of that, because we don’t have many of those days left. You know, eventually our country will become all national holidays.” When Welker pressed for more details on these celebrations, Trump pivoted back to talking about Flag Day and didn’t get into specifics. The U.S. officially claims Nov. 11, 1918, the day an armistice agreement was signed with Germany, as the end of World War I. Sept. 2, 1945, when the U.S. accepted Japan’s surrender, is the date recorded as the end of World War II. Trump also revealed his plans to remodel the White House, starting by replacing grass in the Rose Garden with a “beautiful stone surface.” “We had the prime minister of India here, and they had a lot of press, and the women were walking out with their shoes full of mud. So we can’t have that,” Trump said. The renovations will also include an effort to build a ballroom in the East Wing of the White House using existing meeting rooms. It would be used in part to host world leaders. “You know, when they have a party for, like, when the head of China comes in, or the head of anybody, you know, head of anything,” Trump said, “they have a party where they have a tent 200 yards away, where people have to walk in the rain to get to a tent. And that’s not for us. That’s not for the United States of America.” Trump noted that he built a ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago property and said his background as a real estate developer makes him uniquely equipped to carry out the White House renovation. He told Welker he plans to fund the effort himself. “Yeah, I’m not going to ask the government for money. I’ll fund it, and I’m sure we’ll have some donations to it. But it’s not an inexpensive thing. It’ll cost a lot of money,” Trump said, adding that “it will be something really beautiful, top of the line.” Nnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News."
How GM is trying to revive Cadillac as the quintessential American luxury car brand,The luxury vehicle market is crucial for automakers. The vehicles have higher profit margins than their mainstream counterparts and cater to a more affluent customer.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/gms-decade-long-battle-revive-cadillac-quintessential-american-luxury-rcna204845,"WARREN, Mich. — Walking into General Motors’ global design headquarters is like taking a step back in time. Much of the midcentury modern architecture and designs have remained untouched since the space opened in the 1950s. The massive tech campus was built during a time when the Detroit automaker reigned supreme. It was GM’s so-called Golden Era, with its luxury Cadillac brand leading the way as “the standard of the world” — before decades of U.S. market share declines amid increased competition from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and others. GM President Mark Reuss wasn’t alive to witness that era, but he’s harkened back to it as he and his teams have methodically overseen a product renaissance for Cadillac, which wants to regain its prominence as the American luxury brand. “There isn’t a lot of American luxury brands. There just isn’t. I think it’s time, and I’m deeply passionate about that, for GM and Cadillac to show the world what we can do,” Reuss told CNBC from his second-story office adjacent to the lobby. Cadillac’s domestic competition has historically been Ford Motor’s Lincoln luxury brand, which sells roughly a third of the vehicles in the U.S. as its GM competitor. Other luxury brands from Germany, Japan and, more recently, South Korea have entered the market as well. All-electric vehicle competitors Tesla and Lucid Group are also in the mix. The luxury vehicle market is crucial for automakers. The vehicles have higher profit margins than their mainstream counterparts and cater to a more affluent customer that views them as much as a status symbol as a mode of transportation. Reuss’ responsibilities as president include overseeing all the automaker’s products and brands, but he has always taken a special interest in Cadillac, which is on its fourth leader since 2015. Those involved with the brand have described Reuss as a protector, vanguard and even spiritual leader of sorts for Cadillac. While not everything has gone perfectly to plan — there have been issues with sales in China and electric vehicle production and adoption — Cadillac has largely stayed true to a plan that the company undertook to bolster the luxury brand a decade ago. It’s a not-so-easy accomplishment amid regulatory uncertainty and budget cuts in an automaker the size of GM. “If you would have looked at Cadillac’s financials and portfolio, it was not delivering,” Reuss said. “It’s been a long road taking a 150-year-old brand from where it was, which was not healthy. It was not ‘the standard of the world.’ Still isn’t. We’ve got work to do, but the vision is there and it’s pretty clear.” That vision currently relies heavily on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans and the brand’s flagship Escalade — one of GM’s longest-standing and most prominent nameplates — to bring Cadillac back to prominence. It’s a race Cadillac executives describe as having a never-ending finish line. In the summer of 2018, Reuss, GM design chief Michael Simcoe and then-Cadillac head Steve Carlisle, among others, mapped out what they wanted Cadillac to be ahead of a broader executive rollout at GM’s renowned design dome. It was a reevaluation of sorts of a plan laid out for Cadillac in 2015. The overall strategy was to largely isolate Cadillac’s products from GM’s other brands and not allow the sharing of consumer-focused parts. They would share some bones, motors and other powertrain parts, but the interiors and even some of the engines would be exclusively Cadillac. “We wanted to lay tracks down in terms of what the brand could be. We didn’t have a very consistent approach,” Carlisle recalled during a phone interview. “Many have tried and most have failed.” The idea was to get Cadillac’s portfolio back into shape with sporty, sleek vehicles that elevate the brand’s status and, in turn, lead to higher residual values of the vehicles. The brand also sought to lower incentives. Reuss, around that time, described it as Cadillac’s “one chance,” saying the Detroit automaker would “leave nothing on the table.” Cadillac has largely been able to get its house in order with most of those objectives, according to executives, auto analysts and industry metrics. “Right now, I think they’re in really good shape.” said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. “They have been more consistent with how to handle the Cadillac brand, and that’s going to continue to be incredibly important … consistency over time is one of the most important things you can do.” Cadillac decided to focus its future products to be all-electric vehicles, in a bid to compete with Tesla’s pricey Model Y and Model X at the time. The plan was for Cadillac EVs to eventually take the place of gas-powered models as soon as 2030, but now it’ll offer a full lineup of EVs as well as gas-powered vehicles. The first product released under the new strategy was the all-electric Lyriq that went on sale in 2022, but the pinnacle of the plan is the bespoke, $300,000 Celestiq that the brand is currently “relaunching.” The 2018 showing at the design dome — hallowed ground for the automaker — was crucial to sell the current vision of Cadillac, according to Simcoe, Carlisle and others involved. “In the dome, there was a vision for Celestiq and the Cadillac requirements,” Simcoe told CNBC from his corner design office overlooking the dome. “It was basically all the things that would define the brand. “There was a vision for the customers we’re addressing. There was a vision for the portfolio we needed. There was a vision for pretty much everything inside the business,” Simcoe said. The dome show took place after the exodus of Cadillac’s last president, Johan de Nysschen (all other Cadillac leaders since have been vice presidents), who had discussed the need for the brand to have its own vehicle platforms and powertrains. De Nysschen, an auto industry veteran who’s also led Audi and Infiniti, said he believes Cadillac “has made a lot of progress” since his departure. “I am pleased to say, in broad terms, that they’ve stayed true to the strategic direction that we had been agreed upon with GM top management,” he said during a phone interview. GM’s rule of thumb has been to prioritize “volume over value,” which includes achieving scale on mainstream models ahead of producing luxury vehicles such as Cadillacs. The strategy has helped GM’s profits but it’s been a challenge for Cadillac at times. It’s caused the brand to be late to vehicle segments and resulted in products such as the short-lived Cadillac ELR (a version of the Chevrolet Volt) a decade ago and, more recently, the outgoing XT6 crossover. That is no longer the case for Cadillac as it’s refocused, officials said. For example, there were expectations that GM would do a Cadillac version of the mid-engine Corvette, but Reuss said such a vehicle would not have fit into the brand’s new strategy, noting it would have shared a majority of components with the Corvette. “It was developed as a secondary car to the Corvette, on purpose. We would never do that,” Reuss said, citing potential room for additional specialty, Cadillac-specific vehicles outside of its $300,000-plus Celestiq. The all-electric Celestiq is a bespoke vehicle that the company is hand building at its tech and design campus in Warren. It was always meant to be low-volume production but orders as of the end of last year were only in the dozens. After delayed starts to production and sales, Reuss said GM is essentially relaunching the car after the automaker has gotten its software — a crucial part of the business — in order. “Just to be really transparent, we struggled launching our regular EVs, and so we’ve built our software capability to really execute and execute on time,” Reuss said. “We didn’t want to execute the car without everything being perfect on the software front. … To be honest, we’re relaunching the car.” First customer deliveries of the Celestiq are expected by midyear, according to the company, which declined to disclose how many orders it has received for the car. If successful, it could create a new two-unit business model for the company: one focused on hand-built, high-end vehicles and the other on mass-produced models. Wall Street is starting to once again take notice of Cadillac inside GM’s business, as other growth opportunities have faltered. “One of the real gems is Cadillac that we don’t think gets enough airtime and there’s huge opportunity,” BofA analyst John Murphy said at an investor conference last month with Cadillac’s current leader, John Roth. The decade-long plan for Cadillac also has the brand’s momentum building, particularly in North America — its home market. During the first quarter of this year, Cadillac reported an 18% increase in sales, including its best retail performance since 2008, Roth said. It hit that while offering among the lowest incentives as a percentage of sales price on record average transaction prices of $77,900. “That’s building brand health. That’s building brand value,” Roth, Cadillac global vice president, said at the BofA conference. “It’s a growth brand.” April sales were the brand’s best for that month since 2007, GM CEO Mary Barra said on a call Thursday. She noted all of its U.S. vehicles are produced in America — a potential advantage over German luxury brands and others. “So there is a huge opportunity for us to continue to build and leverage our product strength and the fact that these vehicles are built in the U.S.,” Barra said. Reuss declined to comment on potential impacts to Cadillac as a result of tariffs, but said the American brand is well positioned to continue to grow. While Cadillac grows domestically, Cadillac’s sales in China — its largest market for years until 2024 — have been in free fall. It’s an industrywide problem, as Chinese brands grow in the country, dominating Western brands such as Cadillac, BMW and others. “China is difficult for everyone. How Cadillac addresses that and improves that is not entirely in their control,” Brinley said. “Their products are strong, but I think the dynamics in China are just not in an imported brand’s favor right now.” Cadillac’s sales in China peaked at nearly 232,000 vehicles in 2021, representing 62% of Cadillac’s global sales. In 2024, Chinese sales totaled roughly 110,400 units, or 38%, of its 294,200 sales globally — marking the first time since 2015 that they’ve dropped below 300,000. Reuss, GM’s president, said China remains a focus for the automaker, which also is attempting to return to Europe with Cadillac. GM exited the market after selling its European operations in 2017. Reuss declined to discuss sales targets for Cadillac, but said both China and Europe continue to have a “major role” to play for the brand’ renaissance. “I think the way we execute vehicles globally will change, but Cadillac will be there with the latest and greatest, and we need to rebuild the sales capability, which we’re doing,” Reuss said. Cadillac last year remained off the winner’s podium in terms of sales. It was fifth in the U.S. and seventh globally, according to industry data confirmed by Cadillac. It trailed global leader BMW as well as Mercedes-Benz and Audi, among others. Roth last month said the brand’s success includes sales, but Cadillac’s goals are multifaceted and the race to profitably grow Cadillac continues. “We talk about Cadillac being the ‘standard of the world,’” Roth told investors last month. “Every day that standard never has a finish line. We keep moving that finish line, keep raising the bar on what the brand needs to stand for in the marketplace and keep growing and evolving the brand on a forward-looking basis.”"
"Air traffic control at Newark Airport briefly lost communication with aircraft, kicking off travel chaos","After the incident last week, the controllers from the Philadelphia TRACON took leave under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/air-traffic-control-newark-airport-briefly-lost-communication-aircraft-rcna204941,"Air traffic controllers temporarily lost communication with aircraft flying in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey last week, an incident that has continued to cause major delays at the travel hub. Last Monday, a ground stop was issued at Newark airport because of a Federal Aviation Administration equipment malfunction. The administration has still not clarified what the malfunction was. During the incident, air traffic controllers in Area C of the Philadelphia TRACON, a traffic control facility that guides flights in and out of Newark, lost communication with aircraft traveling to and from the airport, making them unable to see, hear or talk to them, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). The air traffic controllers are in charge of ""separating and sequencing aircraft in and out of Newark Airport."" It's not clear how long the air traffic controllers lost communication with the aircraft. The event led the air traffic controllers to take leave under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, which covers federal employees who are physically injured or experience traumatic events on the job, according to NATCA, a union that represents around 20,000 aviation professionals. While the union did not elaborate on what caused the communication loss, it said it supports Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's ""efforts to upgrade and modernize our nation’s air traffic control systems and infrastructure."" Since the incident, delays and cancellations of flights traveling into and out of Newark airport have been constant. Airlines, including United, have had to cancel hundreds of flights, and dozens of others have been diverted to other airports. Many issues contributed to the disruptions, including understaffing, construction and several instances of technical equipment failure. On Monday afternoon, over 300 flights traveling to and from Newark were delayed, and more than 150 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Bill Walker was one of the passengers whose flight was delayed Monday. ""We were delayed almost three hours in Seattle because they couldn’t get air clearance to come into Newark,"" Walker told NBC News. Other travelers weren’t as lucky. Ireland Hernandez, who was trying to get back home to Mexico, had an afternoon flight to Houston that got canceled. ""We came here just for the weekend and vacation, and we were planning to go back to Los Angeles,"" Hernandez said. ""But we have this connection flight from Newark to Dallas, and then we were driving to Mexico."" She was traveling with her friend Sarah Arce. They said they struggled to get answers or support from airline staff members. “They said, ‘We can’t give you a voucher,’” Arce said. United CEO Scott Kirby said the Philadelphia TRACON ""has been chronically understaffed for years,"" adding that ""Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead."" A shortage in air traffic controllers is an ongoing, nationwide problem. Duffy said that there are 3,000 vacant positions nationwide and that he plans to roll out a strategy to offer incentives to the labor force. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday in a letter to Duffy that there has been neglect in maintaining the air traffic control system, and he praised Duffy for working to hire more controllers. “Decades of underinvestment in the maintenance of critical air traffic control infrastructure, delays in upgrading to modern 21st century air traffic control technology, and inadequate air traffic control staffing have resulted in a frail system nationwide,” said Murphy, a Democrat. Murphy said thousands of passengers at Newark's airport have been affected. He said he was asking Duffy for more investment in New Jersey. The FAA said in a statement Monday that ""our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our workforce"" and that it is working to improve the reliability of communications in the New York City area. The FAA said that when there are staffing or equipment problems, it will slow arrivals in the interest of safety. ""We will keep the public updated as we work through these issues. The FAA will continue to be transparent with the public about the status of Newark and every airport,"" it said, directing people to its website.

Trump's Hollywood tariffs announcement is met with confusion and fear,A host of questions remain about how the president’s plan to slap duties on foreign productions would work.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-hollywood-movie-tariff-announcement-confusion-fear-why-rcna204856,"President Donald Trump’s Sunday night proposal to impose tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. has been met with a mix of confusion and fear by the entertainment industry. And by noon Monday, White House officials clarified that “no final decisions” had been made and that it was “exploring all options.” Trump’s initial proposal, posted to Truth Social, called for tariffs “on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” citing what he said was the harmful impact of incentives being offered by other countries. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN,” Trump wrote. Speaking from the Oval Office just before 2 p.m. Monday, Trump said he would be meeting with industry officials to make sure they were ""happy"" with his tariffs plan. ""I’m not looking to hurt the industry; I'm looking to help,"" he said. Industry officials and observers did not respond well to the initial plan. In a note to clients, analysts with Morgan Stanley called the idea “ill-defined,” noting 100% duties on some or all of the cost of a Hollywood production “would lead to fewer films, more expensive films, and lower earnings for all in the business.” “The reality is that for any given film, there can be writing, production, editing, post-production, visual effects — all done in different countries,” they wrote. The analysts noted Trump’s proposal failed to mention whether the tariffs would also apply to TV productions, what aspect of a production would be tariffed and how it would be charged, and whether the tariffs could be applied retroactively. The tariffs would hit as Hollywood continues to navigate one of the most difficult periods in its history, as social media, changing tastes and habits among viewers, the dawn of artificial intelligence, and the fallout from the writers strike have rattled the industry — and crimped box-office returns. Last year’s box office totaled just $8.75 billion, a 3% decline from 2023 and well off the $11 billion pre-pandemic average. It is true that Hollywood has increasingly opted to take production overseas, with Canada, New Zealand and especially the U.K. seeing some of the biggest jumps in spending and investment. Last year’s biggest live-action hits, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Wicked” and “Dune: Part Two,” were filmed in studios outside the U.S. Yet unlike most sectors Trump has targeted for tariffs, the U.S. entertainment industry has a large trade surplus with the rest of the world, given continued foreign interest in American titles. Multiple Hollywood representatives declined to speak about Trump’s proposal or did not respond to requests for comment. The financial impact, meanwhile, was already being felt: In Monday trading, shares of most entertainment giants, like Netflix, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery, declined. The proposal also comes as Trump has appointed Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” to bring “lost business” back. Notably, all three men have supported Trump and espoused conservative-leaning views. White House officials initially referred additional questions about the proposed tariffs to the Commerce Department. In a post on X, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said “We’re on it” above an account that reposted Trump’s Truth Social post. Other analysts were more upbeat about the ability of content entities to avoid the tariffs. Analysts with Wedbush said, without firsthand knowledge of the White House’s vision, that as long as there was some element of a production performed in the U.S., a tariff could be “avoided or minimized.” They added that studios would likely move some production elements stateside to placate Trump, though this would eat into their profit margins. More substantially, the Wedbush analysts say they believe the entire tariffs episode could eventually subside. “Over the longer term, we expect foreign country reaction and the assertion of its constitutional authority by Congress to cause Trump to change his mind,” they wrote.

Social Security reduces benefit clawback from 100% to 50% for some,Beneficiaries may owe the Social Security Administration money due to overpayments — when their monthly benefit checks are more than what they are owed.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/social-security-reduces-benefit-clawback-100-50-experts-still-warn-dev-rcna204848,"Just weeks after announcing a 100% withholding rate on new overpayments of benefits, the Social Security Administration has slashed the rate down to 50% for certain beneficiaries. Yet that clawback on monthly benefit checks may still cause a financial burden for individuals who are affected, experts say. For new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25, the 50% default withholding rate will apply to so-called Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors and disability insurance, according to an emergency message released by the Social Security Administration. The withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains 10%. “Obviously, it’s better not to lose all of your income,” said Kate Lang, director of federal income security at Justice in Aging, a national organization focused on fighting senior poverty. “But if you’re relying on your benefits to pay your rent or your mortgage and buy food, losing half of that income is going to be devastating and can still result in people becoming homeless,” Lang said. Beneficiaries may owe the Social Security Administration money due to overpayments — when their monthly benefit checks are more than what they are owed. The erroneous payments can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if a beneficiary fails to report a change in their circumstances to the agency or if the agency does not process information promptly or enters errors in its data. When the Social Security Administration determines a beneficiary has been overpaid, a notice is sent to request a full and immediate refund, according to the agency. Beneficiaries typically have 90 days to request a lower rate of withholding, a reconsideration or waiver of recovery. If they do not make such a request within that 90-day window, the agency will withhold up to 50% of their benefits until the sum of the amount that was overpaid is fully recovered, according to the agency’s update. The Social Security Administration had previously announced that it would increase the default withholding rate for overpayments to 100%. Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the default withholding rate had been dropped to 10% of a beneficiary’s monthly benefit or $10 — whichever was greater. Generally, the rate beneficiaries are subject to is based on the terms at the time they were notified. “In the last 100 days, we’ve gone from as low as 10 [percent] to 100 and now to 50,” said Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans. The 100% withholding rate was “ridiculously draconian and cruel,” Fiesta said. The Social Security Administration had said the change to that full recovery rate would generate about $7 billion in program savings in the next decade, based on estimates from the chief actuary. Yet even with the default withholding rate cut in half, beneficiaries may still struggle financially. “Losing 50% [of benefits] for a lot of people could put them into immediate economic hardship,” Fiesta said. In most cases, it wasn’t the beneficiary’s fault that they were overpaid, Fiesta said. “They shouldn’t be put in a worse situation because of something they never caused in the first place,” he said. ‘A lot of discretion’ in negotiating repayment terms While beneficiaries do have the ability to negotiate the payments, there is no guarantee they will be successful and the outcomes may vary, according to Lang. “There are thousands of employees that individual beneficiaries are going to be dealing with to ask for a waiver or ask to negotiate a different repayment rate,” Lang said. “And those employees have a lot of discretion in what they decide.” Beneficiaries who are dealing with overpayment issues also face long wait times to make an appointment to visit a Social Security Administration office, which can interfere with their ability to exercise the options available to them, she said. The Social Security Administration did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment."
Rite Aid files for second bankruptcy in two years,"Rite Aid used its previous bankruptcy in 2023 to cut $2 billion in debt, close hundreds of stores, sell its pharmacy benefit company and negotiate settlements with its lenders.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/rite-aid-files-second-bankruptcy-two-years-rcna204958,"U.S. pharmacy chain Rite Aid on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in as many years, according to a court filing. Pharmacy chains, such as Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS, have been under pressure as falling drug margins and competition from Walmart and Amazon have led to a closure of hundreds of stores. Walgreens, facing significant losses, recently agreed to a $10 billion buyout by private equity firm Sycamore Partners — a dramatic decline from its $100 billion valuation a decade ago, underscoring the severe challenges facing traditional pharmacy retailers. Rite Aid used its previous bankruptcy in 2023 to cut $2 billion in debt, close hundreds of stores, sell its pharmacy benefit company, Elixir, and negotiate settlements with its lenders, drug distribution partner McKesson and other creditors. The previous bankruptcy also resolved hundreds of lawsuits alleging that Rite Aid ignored red flags when filling suspicious prescriptions for addictive opioid pain drugs. But despite those settlements, Rite Aid still had $2.5 billion in debt when it emerged from bankruptcy as a private company owned by its lenders in 2024. According to Monday’s court filing, the company has estimated assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion. The company was unable to secure additional capital from lenders, which it needed to continue operating the business, Bloomberg News reported earlier in the day, citing an internal letter from CEO Matthew Schroeder to the company’s employees. The letter also states that the drug store chain intends to reduce its workforce at its corporate offices in Pennsylvania. Rite Aid operated about 2,000 pharmacies in 2023 but now has only 1,250 stores across the U.S., with recent closures significantly reducing its presence in markets such as Ohio and Michigan."
Trump set to raise millions from crypto and meme coin this month,"The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/trump-set-raise-millions-crypto-meme-coin-month-rcna204847,"President Donald Trump has two crypto-focused dinners on the calendar this month — one aimed at deep-pocketed political donors, the other at meme coin millionaires. Both are poised to help him rake in millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory. The second, on May 22, offers access to Trump’s inner circle not for cash — but for holders of the $TRUMP token. Hosted by MAGA Inc., the “Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner” on May 5 features special guest David Sacks — who has been helping to rewrite the country’s crypto and artificial intelligence rules. The committee receiving the funds, MAGA Inc., is a super PAC that supports Trump. But given that the president is constitutionally barred from running for a third term, it’s unclear how the PAC plans to spend the millions of dollars it is raising this spring at a series of dinners. The crypto community has cheered Sacks’ growing influence in Washington, crediting him and other Trump-aligned appointees with a sweeping policy shift that’s already delivered a spate of regulatory wins across multiple federal agencies — in what many industry executives are describing as a 180 pivot from President Joe Biden. The second gala dinner will be held later this month at Trump National, the president’s private club in the Washington, D.C., area. The guest list will be decided by a blockchain-based contest run by the creators of the $TRUMP meme token. Instead of cash, entry is based on how many tokens a user holds, with the top 220 promised dinner with Trump himself. The contest runs through May 12. The gala, which is black tie optional, offers a “VIP White House Tour” and special reception to the meme coin’s 25-biggest holders. The website hosts an active leaderboard displaying the usernames of the coin’s top buyers. Accountable.US, a center-left watchdog group that investigates corporate and political influence, described the leaderboard contest as “the most nakedly corrupt self-enrichment scheme in U.S. presidential history,” warning it opens the door for wealthy donors — including potentially foreign actors — to buy access to the president, while personally enriching the Trump family. Because crypto wallets are pseudonymous, unless a holder has publicly disclosed their wallet address, it is difficult to independently confirm the identities of the top token holders currently leading the contest. In January, for example, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun upped his token stake in another Trump-related crypto project. The Tron blockchain founder disclosed that he holds $75 million worth of World Liberty Financial’s token. A court filing the following month showed that Sun and the Securities and Exchange Commission were exploring a resolution to the regulator’s civil fraud case against the crypto entrepreneur. The fine print of the $TRUMP contest does not guarantee access to the president. According to the site’s terms and conditions, Trump may not be able to attend and the event can be canceled “for any reason.” In that case, they’ll get a Trump NFT instead. Still, the contest has supercharged demand for the coin — and lined the pockets of its creators. The $TRUMP token surged more than 50% after the gala was announced, boosting the paper value of wallets controlled by insiders and early backers. Roughly 80% of the $TRUMP token supply is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliates, according to the project’s website. Since the token launched in January, trading activity has generated more than $324 million in trading fees for insiders, Chainalysis found. These fees are generated through the token’s built-in mechanism that routes a percentage of each trade to wallets controlled by the project — wallets that, according to the website, are linked to the coin’s creators. Insiders have agreed, however, to delay cashing out their share of tokens for at least another 90 days, according to the project’s public disclosures.

"Skechers to be acquired by 3G Capital in take-private deal, shares soar 25%","The price 3G Capital agreed to pay represents a 30% premium to Skechers’ current valuation on the public markets, which is in line with similar takeover deals.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/skechers-acquired-3g-capital-take-private-deal-shares-soar-25-rcna204846,"Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, ending its nearly three-decade run as a public company, the retailer announced Monday. The price 3G Capital agreed to pay represents a 30% premium to Skechers’ current valuation on the public markets, which is in line with similar takeover deals. Shares of Skechers soared more than 25% after the transaction was announced. “With a proven track-record, Skechers is entering its next chapter in partnership with the global investment firm 3G Capital,” Skechers’ CEO, Robert Greenberg, said in a news release. “Given their remarkable history of facilitating the success of some of the most iconic global consumer businesses, we believe this partnership will support our talented team as they execute their expertise to meet the needs of our consumers and customers while enabling the Company’s long-term growth,” he said. The transaction comes at a difficult time for the retail industry and in particular, the footwear sector, which relies on discretionary spending and overseas supply chains that are now in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Last week Skechers signed onto a letter penned by the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group asking for an exemption from Trump’s tariffs. And, a little over a week ago, Skechers withdrew its full-year 2025 guidance “due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies” as companies brace for a drop in consumer spending that will disproportionately impact the footwear and apparel sectors. Skechers declined to say how much of its supply chain is based in China, which is currently facing 145% tariffs, but cautioned that two-thirds of its business is outside of the U.S. and therefore won’t see as much of an impact. A source close to the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details said the trade environment didn’t force Skechers into a deal and that 3G Capital had been interested in acquiring the company for years. Tariffs do present some uncertainty in the short term, but 3G Capital believes the long-term outlook of Skechers’ business remains attractive and is well positioned for growth, the person said. Skechers is the third-largest footwear company in the world behind Nike and Adidas. Greenberg will stay on as Skechers’ CEO and continue enacting the company’s strategy after the acquisition is completed."
U.S. crude oil prices fall after OPEC+ agrees to surge production in June,"The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed Saturday to increase output by 411,000 more barrels per day in June.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/energy/us-crude-oil-prices-fall-opec-agrees-surge-production-june-rcna204844,"U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 2% on Monday, after OPEC+ agreed to surge production for a second month. U.S. crude was down $1.55, or 2.66%, at $56.74 a barrel by 10:26 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent fell $1.45, or 2.37%, to $59.84 per barrel. Oil prices have fallen about 20% this year. The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed on Saturday to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June. The decision comes a month after OPEC+ surprised the market by agreeing to surge production in May by the same amount. The June production hike is nearly triple the 140,000 bpd that Goldman Sachs had originally forecast. OPEC+ is bringing more than 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market over the course of two months. Oil prices in April posted the biggest monthly loss since 2021, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have raised fears of a recession that will slow demand at the same time that OPEC+ is quickly increasing supply. “Our key conviction remains that high spare capacity and high recession risk skew the risks to oil prices to the downside despite relatively tight spot fundamentals,” Daan Struyven, Goldman’s head of oil research, told clients in a Sunday note. The investment bank cuts its forecast for U.S. crude prices this year by $3 to $56 per barrel. Oilfield service firms such as Baker Hughes and SLB are expecting investment in exploration and production to decline this year due to the weak price environment. “The prospects of an oversupplied oil market, rising tariffs, uncertainty in Mexico and activity weakness in Saudi Arabia are collectively constraining international upstream spending levels,” Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said on the company’s first-quarter earnings call on April 25. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon reported first-quarter earnings last week that fell compared to the same period in 2024 due to lower oil prices."
New college grads face a tougher job market — again,Pessimism runs high in the class of 2025 after entry-level hiring prospects have tightened for two years straight and a student debt crackdown begins.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/new-college-grads-face-tougher-job-market-rcna204249,"This year’s new college graduates are heading into a tougher job market than last year’s — who had it worse off than the class before that — just as the Trump administration cracks down on student loan repayments. Recent grads’ unemployment rate was 5.8% as of March, up from 4.6% a year earlier, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported last week. The share of new graduates working jobs that don’t require their degrees — a situation known as “underemployment” — hit 41.2% in March, rising from 40.6% that same month in 2024. “Right now things are pretty frozen,” Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said of entry-level prospects. “A lot of employers and job seekers are both kind of deer-in-headlights, not sure what to do.” Employers and job seekers are both kind of deer-in-headlights, not sure what to do. ALLISON SHRIVASTAVA, ECONOMIST, INDEED HIRING LAB That squares with Julia Abbott’s experience. “I just feel pretty screwed as it is right now,” said the psychology major who’s graduating this month from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. She said she’s applied to over 200 roles in social media and marketing, but “minimal interviews come out of it.” Internship postings typically rise sharply in early spring, but they’re lagging 11 percentage points behind last year’s levels, Indeed said in April. The hiring platform sees demand for interns as a stronger gauge of new grads’ job prospects than entry-level postings, which increasingly target people with at least a few years’ experience. In a worrying sign for the class of 2025, internship openings are “far below where they were in 2023 and 2022, when the labor market was exceptionally competitive,” Shrivastava said. Young college grads have historically seen lower unemployment levels than the labor force overall, and they still do. But as The Atlantic pointed out Wednesday, this gap has narrowed to a record low, taking some of the shine off the traditional benefits of a bachelor’s degree. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is restarting the “involuntary” repayment of federal student loans in default, a move that could sap money from paychecks, tax refunds, Social Security payments and disability and retirement benefits from millions of borrowers. Repayments were paused during President Donald Trump’s first term in 2020 in response to Covid-19. The pandemic-era reprieve from forced collections ends Monday, just as a new TransUnion report finds a record share of federal student loan borrowers are 90 days or more past due and at risk of default — at 20.5% as of February, up 10 percentage points from five years earlier. The debt crackdown comes as workers across the labor force confront a tougher hiring landscape. Employers added a better-than-expected 177,000 jobs in April, government data showed Friday, but analysts were quick to flag warning signs ahead. Average pay growth has slowed to a crawl, and unemployment metrics indicate it’s taking longer for people looking for work to secure it. While the latest jobs numbers point to a “resilient” labor market, “we should curb our enthusiasm going forward given the backdrop of trade policies that will likely be a drag on the economy,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a statement Friday. “The outlook remains very uncertain.” The murky jobs forecast coincides with broader economic turbulence fueled by Trump’s ongoing trade war. A slew of major companies have warned about tariff impacts in recent days. All but the wealthiest households are tightening their budgets, and consumer outlooks plunged to a 13-year low in a closely watched Conference Board survey released Tuesday. Some of the spending that is taking place reflects shoppers and businesses racing to make purchases before tariffs drive up costs for everything from cars to frozen fish and fireworks. These headwinds are making many employers increasingly cautious about hiring young graduates. Employers have pulled back plans to hire more new grads over just the last six months, according to a February and March survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, which polled major companies including Chevron, PepsiCo and Southwest Airlines. While most said their new-grad recruitment plans are holding steady, the share of respondents planning to expand entry-level hiring dipped to 24.6% this spring. That’s down from 27% last fall and the lowest rate since autumn 2020, during the depths of the pandemic. In March, NACE released salary projections showing a mixed picture for the class of 2025, with social sciences graduates set to see a 3.6% drop in pay since last year, while agriculture and natural resources majors were on track for a 2.8% bump over their ’24 predecessors. The estimates, however, were based on employer survey data from last fall, weeks before Trump took office. “I’m not surprised that new hiring is being restricted,” said Andy West, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey who advises CEOs on corporate strategy and finance. He said some clients are increasingly discussing ways to “reallocate resources” amid tariffs and other macroeconomic worries, he said. As employers hunt for cost cuts and stability, many tend to zero in on expenses that fluctuate over time, including payrolls. It just feels really scary, like walking into this world and not having something set out for me. JULIA ABBOTT, JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY, CLASS OF 2025 “When it comes to hiring and talent, often these are very short-term decisions around slowing down,” he said. Class of ’25 job seekers are adjusting their expectations to the tighter market. More than half have ditched the “dream job” plans they entered college with, according to a February survey by the grads-focused hiring platform Handshake. And 56% of current seniors are somewhat or very pessimistic about launching into the workforce right now. That’s about the same share as last year, but outlooks are down more sharply in fields like computer science, where over a quarter of seniors with that major voiced extreme pessimism. Anxiety around landing a first full-time job is common among college students, but the deep uncertainty this year threatens to put a damper on commencement season. “I can’t really celebrate my past four years,” said Abbott, the JMU senior. “It just feels really scary, like walking into this world and not having something set out for me.” J.J.

Trump says he'll call CEOs when he disagrees with their business decisions,Retailers have increasingly offered warnings about the tariffs' impact on consumers.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-call-ceos-plans-prices-tariffs-rcna204702,"President Donald Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that he’d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary. The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was going to begin to list tariff charges on certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to impose 145% tariffs on China. ""He’s just a very nice guy,"" Trump said of Bezos in an interview that aired Sunday. ""We have a relationship. I asked him about [the tariff charge language Amazon considered including in listings]. He said, 'Well, I don’t want to do that,' and he took it off immediately."" Trump and Bezos appear to have developed a closer relationship in the last few months than they had during Trump’s first administration. In December, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Bezos attended his swearing-in ceremony. Bezos stepped down as the company's CEO in 2021, but he is still its executive chairman. Indeed, in a statement shortly after the Punchbowl report, an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News, ""The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen.” Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: ""Sure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them."" ""If I think that somebody’s doing something that’s incorrect, wrong or maybe hurtful to the country, I’ll call,"" he added. ""Wouldn’t you want me to call? [Former President Joe] Biden wouldn’t call because he didn’t know what was happening, but I do."" In the interview, Trump defended his decision to impose major tariffs on imports from China, saying the move is supposed to give companies incentives to build factories in the United States to avoid paying tariffs, not simply raise prices on consumers to offset the cost of tariffs. ""I don’t view it as a tax. I view it as an incentive for people to come into the United States and build plants, factories, offices, a lot of things. I think it’s an incentive,"" he told Welker. ""What people don’t understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. The company eats the tariff. And it’s not passed along at all,"" he added. Several other major online retailers, like Temu, a low-cost retail site based in China, have already begun charging consumers tariff fees, adding a line item on purchases that's listed as “import charges.” Other popular American retailers, like Béis, Bare Necessities and Fashion Nova, have urged consumers to shop more in the near term, predicting that imposing future tariffs could force them to raise prices. Larger companies, like PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, have issued similar warnings, telling shareholders in recent meetings that they're already seeing the impacts of tariffs on earnings. Trump has acknowledged that tariffs could have an impact on the availability of consumer goods in the near term. Asked whether his remark about children having fewer toys during a Cabinet meeting was an acknowledgment that tariffs would cause prices to rise, Trump told Welker: ""I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls, because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable."" Trump made a similar remark at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, telling members of his administration: ""Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” But he pushed back against the assertion that he was predicting price hikes or supply shortages due to tariffs. ""I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,"" he said, adding, ""we don’t have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don’t need, for junk that we don’t need.""

Stocks unleash remarkable comeback after a historic dive from Trump's tariffs announcement,The S&P 500 has notched its longest winning streak in 20 years after suffering some of its worst-ever drawdowns.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stocks-unleash-remarkable-comeback-after-volatile-month-trump-tariffs-rcna204213,"In the week following President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement, it looked like the stock market had seen a ghost. Over the course of seven days following his April 2 announcement, the S&P 500 lost more than 12%, a decline not typically seen outside of extreme events like the Covid-19 pandemic and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. That stretch last month also saw the fifth-worst two-day percentage decline since World War II. Government bond yields, too, began to creep steadily upward, making it more expensive for the U.S. to borrow money, amid signs that both the substance and erratic rollout of Trump’s tariff plan were testing traders’ faith in the United States’ ability to make timely payments on its debt. Stocks around the world sold off, too. “April was an absolutely seismic month in financial markets, as the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs led to a huge global sell-off,” analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients Thursday. “The initial moves were truly historic in their speed.” With the stock and bond markets blaring red alerts, Trump backed off some of his tariffs on April 9, triggering euphoria among investors. After he announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs for “non-retaliating” countries, the S&P saw its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, with a 9.5% gain. At the same time, the sell-off in Treasurys stabilized. Now, 32 days after the historic Rose Garden speech, stocks have executed a stunning comeback of sorts, with the broader market largely returning to where it was when the “Liberation Day” tariffs were first announced. Volatility in government borrowing costs, too, has leveled off. The gains are relative: Stocks remain about 6% below their pre-Inauguration Day levels. But some blue chip companies like Apple are still hobbling. The iPhone maker’s stock is down more than 20% since its all-time high last winter, though partly for reasons beyond the president’s policies. Tesla, which is helmed by Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, is still 40% off its December peak. Nevertheless, the broader recovery has been significant. According to Dow Jones, the eight trading days through Thursday last week saw the biggest gain for the S&P 500 since November 2020, when markets showed their first signs of recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. And with Friday’s close, the index saw its longest winning streak in 20 years. Experts say the recovery has been fueled by a combination of Trump’s softening tone on tariffs and investors entering an “acceptance” stage that whatever the president ends up saying, tariffs are here to stay in some form or another. “Markets are adjusting to the tariffs story and saying, ‘OK, this has happened, now what do we do about it?’” said Roxanna Islam, head of research at VettaFi, an asset management platform. “People are starting to look more forward than backward.” If flows of money into a popular low-cost investment vehicle are any indication, the recovery has been led by so-called “retail” investors, opportunistic buyers who are more apt to make daily market trades. That group stands in contrast to longer-term investors like 401(k) holders or large institutions, which typically take a more measured, long-term view of investing. According to the Vanguard investment group, which runs investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), “bulls,” or net buyers of stocks, outnumbered “bears” (net sellers) by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1 among self-directed investors. The Vanguard ETF saw a $21 billion inflow last month, the most in its 15-year history and the fifth-largest amount ever taken in by a fund on a monthly basis, Bloomberg News reported. “It would be simplistic to say it’s just retail — but to a large extent it has been,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at the Interactive Brokers financial group. The retail investment boom surfaced during the pandemic, when day traders turned to playing markets amid nationwide shutdowns. The trend became best known for fueling mania in “meme” stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond that would see intense run-ups in price amid online speculation about company turnarounds. The meme-stock days have largely faded, but the impulse to “buy the dip” — the popular phrase used to describe when investors bet on stock prices rising after they’ve gone down — remains, Sosnick said. “I think the key element has been American investors’ unrelenting faith that every dip is a buying opportunity,” he said. “And if enough have this faith, it can make itself true.” The recovery remains extremely fragile. Stocks are highly sensitive to any hints of trade deals, especially with China, which was excluded from Trump’s initial tariff pause. As recently as Friday, stocks surged on a Wall Street Journal report that China was open to addressing Trump’s concerns about its role in the fentanyl crisis as an entry point for both sides softening their trade dispute. And the overall economic picture remains uncertain. Despite a strong jobs report Friday, other indicators suggest the economy is throttling back. Economic growth was negative for the first three months of the year, and while much of that was a function of a surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to a 1.8% quarterly gain after surging to a 4% gain in the fourth quarter last year. Friday’s jobs report also showed the median duration of unemployment is surging and average hourly earnings growth is slowing. Companies, too, are lowering their financial guidance for the year, or withdrawing it as they await clarity on how Trump’s tariffs shake out. As a result, overall investment sentiment remains bearish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), whose regular survey most recently showed that expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 3.7 percentage points to 59.3%. “Bearish sentiment is unusually high and is above its historical average of 31.0% for the 22nd time in 24 weeks,” the AAII said. “Bearish sentiment has now been above 50% for 10-consecutive weeks, the longest period over 50% in the survey’s history.” Even for people without direct exposure to the stock market, the negative sentiment can have an impact on the broader economy, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. “Those negative headlines do take a toll beyond those who have a particular stake in the market,” he said. There are also signs that the “Sell America” trade is lingering, according to Bob Elliott, CEO of the Unlimited Funds investment group, who noted in a post on X Friday that the value of the U.S. dollar remains well below where it was just before Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, while gold and foreign stocks have been outperforming U.S. equities. There’s been a “rotation away from the U.S.” even with better-than-expected data, Elliott said. In short, it remains to be seen where the market goes from here. “It’s still early,” said Islam, of VettaFi. “There’s still a lot of that uncertainty.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."
Major delays at Newark Liberty Airport wreak havoc with weekend travel plans,United Airlines canceled dozens of flights at Newark following a chaotic week of travel that left some passengers dealing with massive delays.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/delays-newark-airport-weekend-rcna204623,"The skies above the Garden State are not so friendly this weekend if you’re flying into or out of New Jersey’s Newark Liberty Airport. Delays averaged just under two hours out of Newark by late Saturday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. United CEO Scott Kirby said his airline had to cancel dozens of flights at Newark following a chaotic week of travel that left some passengers dealing with massive delays. “United is committed to doing absolutely everything in our power to minimize the impact that this will have on customers and so we are unilaterally cancelling 35 roundtrip flights per day from our Newark schedule starting this weekend,” Kirby’s statement said. In addition to United, hundreds more flights at Newark were completely canceled, and dozens more were diverted to other airports because of the chaotic scene in New Jersey. Some of the main issues causing travel disruptions involved construction, several instances of technical equipment failure and understaffing. One of the runways at Newark is closed until mid-June because of construction, limiting the operation capacity to the 76 U.S. cities and 81 international countries it services. Jaki Maurey-Delaunay experienced delays as she was flying in from London Saturday afternoon with her son. “We live in London, family is important to us. It’s not a cheap ticket so every minute counts for us,” she said. The pair were traveling to Newark just for 24 hours to make a family event. “I got an alert Thursday. They were asking me if I wanted to change my flight. They were actually sending an alert asking if I wanted to change my flight because of congestion but I was like, ‘I can’t change my flight, I need to get there’. So I was a bit panicked getting to the airport,” she said. The extreme delays this week rippled out to other airports across the country and altered thousands of passengers’ travel plans. There have also been staffing issues at the Philadelphia TRACON, a traffic control facility that guides flights in and out of Newark. “Keep in mind, this particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, it’s now clear — and the FAA tells us — that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,” Kirby said. The staffing issues, particularly involving air traffic controllers, are a nationwide problem. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said there were some 3,000 vacant positions nationwide and he’s planning to roll out a strategy to incentivize the labor force. According to a statement released by the FAA, the plan includes financial incentives to try and ease the declining workforce numbers. The plan also includes recruiting military controllers, providing bonuses for academy graduates and working with controllers nearing the end of their career to attempt to get them to stay until the required retirement age of 56.

How tariffs are affecting the Kentucky Derby,Uncertainty over the economy due to President Donald Trump’s oscillating tariff policies looms large over America’s longest running sporting event.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/taxes/tariffs-are-affecting-kentucky-derby-rcna204533,"There are no sure things on the Churchill Downs racetrack — and this year, there are few sure things around the track as well. Uncertainty over the economy due to President Donald Trump’s oscillating tariff policies looms large over America’s longest running sporting event and the most exciting two minutes in sports — the Kentucky Derby. The track itself has put some projects on hold. Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby “Uncertainty is a theme out there in the American economy, and that’s one we pay attention to,” said Bill Carstanjen, CEO of Churchill Downs. “So we did pause our $900 million construction project primarily, and mostly because we weren’t sure what things were going to cost. And whenever you build something, you’ve got to be very careful on the cost side.” Churchill Downs announced last week it was pausing a major renovation project it had announced in February due to the uncertainty in the economy and Trump’s tariffs. The racetrack had planned to debut these renovations during the next year’s racing season, including more than 20,000 new seats, 36 luxury suites and upgrades to the infrastructure. But the higher price of steel — crucial to construction — and supply chain interruptions, created a “double whammy” for Churchill Downs. Carstanjen said the tariffs and current economic environment created “unanticipated and currently unquantifiable expected cost increases in materials.” While the 151st Kentucky Derby is on track to meet its normal attendance, Carstanjen did see some hesitance in sales this year, particularly in the lower-tier tickets. In addition to ticket sales, Carstanjen said Churchill Downs is seeing overall “softness” in some areas of betting, including a slip in sports wagering to the tune of more than $1 million. He blamed faltering consumer confidence. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat in a largely Republican state, called Trump’s tariffs an “attack on American people” and noted that both Republican senators from his state have also criticized the president’s economic strategy. “The president’s current tariff plan is causing chaos in our economy,” he said at a press conference Thursday. “It is slowing our economic growth. It’s hitting large businesses, with UPS announcing a lot of layoffs. It’s hitting small and medium-sized businesses.” Many Derby goers were cognizant of Churchill Downs’ announcement, especially those who were impressed by this year’s renovations. Ed Massey of New Jersey has been coming to the Derby for decades. “Tariffs are not going to get in the way of the 151-year Derby spirit,” he told NBC News. “But I do worry about the future growth of the event. The Derby will outlast any tariffs, but will it be able to grow? That remains to be seen.” Horse racing and betting aren’t the only two Kentucky staples that are taking a hit from the tariffs. Economic experts in the state say they’ve already seen an impact on agriculture, energy, manufacturing and bourbon — which has a $9 billion impact in Kentucky. “A billion-dollar investment is more than just what it means for the track — that will have a ripple effect on the economy in the region,” said Kate Shanks, vice president of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. “You’ve got to purchase lumber. You’ve got to purchase glass, steel, hire electricians, HVAC workers, and we were eager to see that happen. And now that’s been paused, and it’s absolutely going to have an impact on jobs in the region.” According to the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the state has approximately 480,000 jobs that depend on trade. The chamber estimated these tariffs will cost the average Kentuckian up to $1,200 per year. Olympia Sonnier is a field producer for NBC News."
Warren Buffett to ask board to make Greg Abel CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end,"Buffett noted he would still ‘hang around’ to help, but the final word on company operations would be with Abel, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations for Berkshire.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/warren-buffett-greg-abel-ceo-succession-rcna204634,"OMAHA, Nebraska — An end of an era was announced in Omaha Saturday as Warren Buffett said he will soon ask the board of Berkshire Hathaway to have Greg Abel replace him as CEO at year end. While Buffett is 94 and Abel was designated as CEO successor in 2021, it nonetheless came as surprise to the thousands of admiring shareholders gathered for this year’s annual meeting to once again hear the investing legend opine on the future of the company. “Tomorrow, we’re having a board meeting of Berkshire, and we have 11 directors. Two of the directors, who are my children, Howie and Susie, know of what I’m going to talk about there. The rest of them, this will come as news to, but I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” said Buffett, in the final few minutes of the meeting. Buffett, who took over as CEO of the former textiles company in 1965, said he will still ‘hang around’ to help, but the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations for Berkshire. “I could be helpful, I believe, in that in certain respects, if we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything,” he added. Buffett, who owns more than $160 billion in Berkshire as its largest shareholder, said he wouldn’t sell a single share of the stock after he transitions to this new phase. “I would add this, the decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,” said Buffett, who used a cane to walk around the meeting, but answered questions for four hours with surprising energy and clarity for his age. Buffett sang Abel’s praises in front of some 40,000 shareholders Saturday, saying his more hands-on managerial style is working better for Berkshire’s 60-plus subsidiaries. Abel is based in Des Moines, Iowa. “It’s working way better with Greg than with me because, you know, I didn’t want to work as hard as he works,” Buffett said. “I could get away with it because we’ve got a basically good business, very good business.” The Canadian executive, born in Edmonton, Alberta, has a 25-year tenor at Berkshire under his belt. Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 when the conglomerate bought MidAmerican Energy, where he eventually became the CEO in 2008. Prior to that, Abel worked at CalEnergy where he transformed the small geothermal firm into a diversified energy business. “I think they’ll be unanimously in favor of it,” Buffett said of the board’s pending CEO decision Sunday. Buffett and Abel told CNBC’s Becky Quick after the shareholder meeting that the pair would discuss at the Sunday board meeting what Buffett’s role will be formally next year. Buffett is currently also chairman of the conglomerate. So it’s not clear whether Abel will also assume the chairman role. Buffett told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that his son Howie Buffett would become nonexecutive chairman after his death to preserve the company culture. It’s not clear whether this move will impact that decision. “It surprises me, but it impresses me,” said Ron Olson a Berkshire board director, after the shareholder meeting Saturday. “I am very anxious to see Warren become the Charlie Munger for Greg Abel.” After the surprise announcement that apparently Abel didn’t even know was coming, the meeting ended with a standing ovation for Buffett."
Retailers are turning the trade war into a sales event,Buy now or pay later: Brands beg shoppers to spend before Trump’s tariffs hit their prices.,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/retailers-are-turning-trade-war-sales-event-rcna204066,"The add-to-cart callouts are widespread, and lately they’re coming with a trade war twist: buy now to beat the tariffs. Retailers and e-commerce brands have been flooding social media in recent weeks with appeals to shoppers’ well-founded fears that President Donald Trump’s import taxes will raise prices, urging them to act now before that happens. “Tariffs are rising — but our prices aren’t (for now)!” promised DTG Pro, a printing equipment seller, in a recent Instagram post with a 10% discount code. “Unfortunately, the bridal industry is not excluded from the rising tariffs, so take advantage of our pre-tariff SAMPLE SALE until 4/15, when we will be forced to raise our prices!” New York-based Adrienne’s Bridal posted last month. The marketing blitz comes amid souring consumer attitudes that have already fueled a buying spree among businesses and ordinary shoppers alike. The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter as consumers scooped up foreign goods and companies raced to stockpile materials and inventories before steeper levies hit their supply chains. While Trump’s tariff policies have rolled out erratically for weeks, many foreign goods are already pricier than they were just months ago. Despite a series of partial walk-backs and temporary reprieves on a range of imports, key parts of the president’s trade agenda are just now kicking in. With the costs of many foreign-made auto parts set to jump by 25% this weekend, automakers have seen vehicle sales spike by double-digits amid tariff fear-buying that they expect to peter out soon. Some dealerships are trying to keep that momentum going as long as they can. “Get your new vehicle before prices change!” Coastal Hyundai, a Melbourne, Florida-based dealership, told buyers as part of a “Tariff Free Savings Event.” Some promotions have leaned into the uncertainty around which duties might stick. “The Tariffs Are Coming… Or Are They? We’re as unsure as everyone else,” a custom sticker company posted in March, offering 12% off through the end of March. “If our costs go up, so will our prices. Now’s your chance to lock in savings before that happens.” There’s an expectation that certain products are going to be expensive, so having a promotion today is certainly very valuable. DULEEP RODRIGO, U.S. CONSUMER AND RETAIL LEAD, KPMG Half of U.S. consumers are actively seeking out discounts and promotions in their summer purchases, according to a recent survey by the accounting firm KPMG. More than 70% expect a recession within the next year. “In some cases, it’s certainly working,” Duleep Rodrigo, who leads U.S. consumer and retail consulting at KPMG, said of tariff-based marketing campaigns. “We’ve seen auto sales up. We’ve seen appliances pick up. There’s an expectation that certain products are going to be expensive, so having a promotion today is very valuable.” Some companies are taking a more somber tone, warning that tariffs could kill their business and appealing to customers to help keep them afloat without having to hike prices. “These may be uncertain times, but the kitchen is a refuge,” wrote Burlap & Barrel, a seller of single-origin spices, in an April Instagram post. Pledging to keep its $10 price cap and free shipping minimum — and to continue its revenue-sharing program with smallholder farmers — the company added that it was “extending our biggest sale ever, up to 20% off sitewide.” Many of the brands trying to drum up shoppers’ support appeared to be smaller retailers and startups that sell and market heavily online. Small businesses have warned in recent weeks that tariffs pose an existential threat, saying they have less leeway than big corporate rivals to shake up their suppliers or absorb higher costs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents some 3 million companies ranging from corporate juggernauts to Main Street operators, appealed to the White House on Wednesday for exclusions from the import taxes to spare small businesses from “irreparable harm.” Some e-commerce companies have already taken to social media to announce tariff-driven changes, like a shutdown in shipments to U.S. customers. A White House spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Retail analysts said even the more opportunistic-sounding marketing reflects businesses’ efforts to adapt to the evolving trade landscape. “There are all these legitimate financial reasons why you might need to have a sale now, or need to lower your pricing now, or need to change your marketing message to try to drive more sales now,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe and founder of the retail media company Retailgeek. Many entrepreneurs could be thinking: “I can lean into it and drive some additional sales — and if I don’t, one of my competitors might,” Goldberg said. “We’re seeing real moves that are economically necessitated, and we’re seeing opportunistic marketing, very often from the same people.” We’re seeing real moves that are economically necessitated, and we’re seeing opportunistic marketing, very often from the same people. JASON GOLDBERG, CHIEF COMMERCE STRATEGY OFFICER, PUBLICIS GROUPE Other companies are taking a more openly political stance with “anti tariff” sales, and recasting online shopping as a form of resistance. “Donald Trump’s tariffs are a terrible deal for, well, everyone,” Charles Ryan, partner and chief operating officer at Monte Cook Games, wrote in a February blog post. Noting that virtually all of its books, games and card decks were manufactured in Canada or China, both of which Trump has targeted with tariffs, Ryan promised a 25% discount on all existing physical products. The company, which has decades-old ties to the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, produces two to four years of supply at a time, Ryan said in emailed comments. That means most of its inventory is now sitting on warehouse shelves, while the 15-20 new products Monte Cook makes each year are a “different story,” he said. For its next big tabletop game, the brand is already working to keep costs down by producing many of its components in ""no- or low-tariff territories"" and assembling the project in its home state of Kansas — approximating the type of outcome the Trump administration has repeatedly said its levies are meant to spur. “The coming impact of these tariffs is going to be terrible for business and consumers of all stripes. If we can offset some of that through a period of higher sales now, that’s good for us,” Ryan said. “If it reassures our fans that their hobby isn’t going to be destroyed right away, and lets them save a few bucks, it’s hard to see a downside to that.” J.J.

Temu halts shipping direct from China as de minimis tariff loophole is cut off,"The loophole, which allowed items worth $800 or below to enter the U.S. duty-free since 2016, expired Friday as an executive order signed by Trump last month.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/temu-halts-shipping-direct-china-de-minimis-tariff-loophole-cut-rcna204597,"Chinese bargain retailer Temu changed its business model in the U.S. as the Trump administration’s new rules on low-value shipments took effect Friday. In recent days, Temu has abruptly shifted its website and app to only display listings for products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses. Items shipped directly from China, which previously blanketed the site, are now labeled as out of stock. Temu made a name for itself in the U.S. as a destination for ultra-discounted items shipped direct from China, such as $5 sneakers and $1.50 garlic presses. It’s been able to keep prices low because of the so-called de minimis rule, which has allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free since 2016. The loophole expired Friday at 12:01 a.m. EDT as a result of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in April. Trump briefly suspended the de minimis rule in February before reinstating the provision days later as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a mountain of low-value packages. The end of de minimis, as well as Trump’s new 145% tariffs on China, has forced Temu to raise prices, suspend its aggressive online advertising push and now alter the selection of goods available to American shoppers to circumvent higher levies. A Temu spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that all sales in the U.S. are now handled by local sellers and said they are fulfilled “from within the country.” Temu said pricing for U.S. shoppers “remains unchanged.” “Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform,” the spokesperson said. “The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.” Before the change, shoppers who attempted to purchase Temu products shipped from China were confronted with “import charges” of between 130% and 150%. The fees often cost more than the individual item and more than doubled the price of many orders. Temu advertises that local products have “no import charges” and “no extra charges upon delivery.” The company, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has gradually built up its inventory in the U.S. over the past year in anticipation of escalating trade tensions and the removal of de minimis. Shein, which has also benefited from the loophole, moved to raise prices last week. The fast-fashion retailer added a banner at checkout that says, “Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You’ll never have to pay extra at delivery.” Many third-party sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese manufacturers to source or assemble their products. The company’s Temu competitor, called Amazon Haul, has relied on de minimis to ship products priced at $20 or less directly from China to the U.S. Amazon said Tuesday following a dustup with the White House that had it considered showing tariff-related costs on Haul products ahead of the de minimis cutoff but that it has since scrapped those plans. Prior to Trump’s second term in office, the Biden administration had also looked to curtail the provision. Critics of the de minimis provision argue that it harms American businesses and that it facilitates shipments of fentanyl and other illicit substances because, they say, the packages are less likely to be inspected by customs agents.

"Trump downplays recession fears, saying the U.S. would be 'OK' in the long term","Speaking to NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Trump said the U.S. is in a “transition period” but will “do fantastically” in the long run.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-downplays-recession-fears-saying-us-ok-long-term-rcna203511,"President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed concerns about potential economic trouble, saying everything would be “OK” in the long term, even if the U.S economy experienced a recession in the short term. Asked twice by “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker whether it would be OK in the long run if there were a recession in the short term, the president said, “Look, yeah, it’s — everything’s OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically.” Following up, Welker asked Trump if he was worried about a recession, to which he responded, “No.” Asked whether he thinks one could happen, Trump replied, “Anything can happen, but I think we’re going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.” The remarks come as analysts on Wall Street are increasingly worried that the country could face a recession due to Trump’s changing tariff policy. “Well, you know, you say, ‘Some people on Wall Street say’ — well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them?” Trump said during the interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “There are many people on Wall Street say this is going to be the greatest windfall ever happen,” the president added. According to initial measurements released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the U.S. economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, a reduction largely driven by a fall in exports and a boost in imports ahead of Trump’s expected tariffs. On Wednesday, while meeting with members of his Cabinet, Trump deflected blame for the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, saying they were a result of the economy former President Joe Biden left behind. “You probably saw some numbers today,” Trump said, “and I have to start off by saying, that’s Biden.” “That’s not Trump,” he added Wednesday. “Because we came in on January, these are quarterly numbers, and we came in and I was very against everything that Biden was doing in terms of the economy, destroying our country in so many ways.” Since the start of his administration in January, Trump has sought to impose tariffs on America’s largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Early last month, the president paused the introduction of larger tariffs on most countries for 90 days, just days after imposing them. His partial retreat fueled a rally in markets, which as of Friday recovered the losses they suffered after his initial tariff announcement on April 2. At the same time, Trump slapped even more tariffs on China, raising the tariff rate on the Asian nation to 145%. Still, the president has repeatedly dismissed concerns that the tariffs on China will have major effects on the prices or availability of consumer goods in the U.S. During the Cabinet meeting, he told reporters, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” Alexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News."
"Kohl's CEO fired for steering business to a person with whom he had a relationship, retailer says",An investigation by an outside law firm found that Ashley Buchanan had not disclosed the relationship as required by company policy.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kohls-ceo-fired-steering-business-person-relationship-retailer-says-rcna204441,"Kohl’s CEO Ashley Buchanan was fired this week because he had an undisclosed personal relationship with a vendor on a consulting team that made a multimillion-dollar deal with the retailer at his direction, the company said in a regulatory filing. Buchanan had only been in the role since January. An investigation by an outside law firm found Buchanan had violated company policies by directing the company to enter into “vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest,” the department store said. The Kohl’s board of directors terminated Buchanan for cause, the company said, and appointed board director Michael Bender as the interim CEO. Kohl’s said Buchanan’s firing was unrelated to the company’s performance and did not involve any other employees. Buchanan previously held the same position at the crafts retailer Michaels since 2020. He became Kohl’s chief executive in January. Kohl’s said Wednesday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the investigation found Buchanan had directed the company to “conduct business with a vendor founded by an individual with whom Mr. Buchanan has a personal relationship on highly unusual terms favorable to the vendor.” The filing said the unnamed person was also part of a consulting team that had entered into a multimillion-dollar agreement with Kohl’s under Buchanan’s direction. The regulatory filing said Buchanan did not disclose the relationship as required under company policy, and he will have to forfeit all equity awards and bonuses he received from Kohl’s when he was hired. He also will have to reimburse the company on a pro-rated basis for a $2.5 million signing bonus. Kohl’s did not disclose who the consulting agreement was with, but The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report Buchanan had been fired, said it was Boston Consulting Group, where Buchanan’s romantic partner, Chandra Holt, was an adviser. The Journal report cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. Buchanan and Holt did not immediately reply to requests for comment made by phone and email. Boston Consulting Group said in a statement to NBC News that it was “shocked to learn of the relationship between” Holt and Buchanan. “We have strict guidelines for our senior advisors to disclose any conflicts of interest,” Boston Consulting said, adding it had terminated Holt’s contract for nondisclosure. The Boston Consulting Group said Holt is a recognized industry expert who worked for the group on a part time basis and was paid by the hour. “She was not involved in structuring the project or negotiating any contract terms and was not expected to lead any part of the project,” the group said.

American Airlines to debut new suites with sliding doors after delays,"American first unveiled the new design in September 2022 and expected to start flying the new seats in 2024 but, like other carriers, faced delays from suppliers.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/american-airlines-debut-new-suites-sliding-doors-delays-rcna204457,"American Airlines’ new suites with sliding doors are set to start flying on some of its planes in June, a key part of its strategy to compete against more profitable rivals for high-spending customers. American first unveiled the new design in September 2022 and expected to start flying the new seats in 2024 but, like other carriers, faced delays from suppliers. First- and business-class airplane seats throughout the industry have become so elaborate that they’ve held up deliveries of new aircraft. American’s new suites on the Boeing 787-9 will debut for regularly scheduled service on June 5 between its hub at Chicago O’Hare International Airport and London Heathrow Airport, followed by Philadelphia to London on Aug. 6 and Philadelphia to Zurich on Sept. 3. Another flight, outfitted with the new seats, between Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and Brisbane, Australia, is set to start Oct. 26. A roundtrip leaving Aug. 11 and returning Aug. 18 between Philadelphia and London in the “Flagship business class” costs $5,342 on American’s website. The 787-9 cabin will feature 51 of the “Flagship Suites,” which will be the new international business class. The carrier’s 787-9s currently have 30 Flagship business-class seats, 21 premium economy, 34 extra-legroom seats and 200 in standard economy. American said in 2022 that it plans to get rid of its international first class on many of its planes in favor of the larger single premium cabin at the front of the plane. It’s retrofitting older 777-300ER jets and will have a similar, but smaller, layout on its Airbus A321XLRs. The craze of offering sliding doors has rippled through the industry. Rivals like JetBlue Airways have upgraded their highest-end cabins to feature the doors, while Santiago, Chile-based Latam Airlines said Thursday that it started operating its new business class with sliding doors on some of its aircraft, part of a $360 million fleet refresh. Delta Air Lines’ Delta One suites offer the feature and United Airlines is rumored to soon unveil upgraded premium seating that could feature sliding doors as well. United didn’t immediately comment. American is also upgrading other amenities, like offering free Wi-Fi to its loyalty program members, which Delta already does and United is set to provide this year."
Jeff Bezos discloses plan to sell up to $4.8 billion in Amazon stock,"Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 but remains Amazon’s top shareholder, is selling the shares as part of a trading plan adopted on March 4, the filing states.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/jeff-bezos-discloses-plan-sell-4point8-billion-amazon-stock-rcna204458,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, according to a financial filing on Friday. Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 but remains Amazon’s top shareholder, is selling the shares as part of a trading plan adopted on March 4, the filing states. The stake would be worth about $4.8 billion at the current price. The disclosure follows Amazon’s first-quarter earnings report late Thursday. While profit and revenue topped estimates, the company’s forecast for operating income in the current quarter came in below Wall Street’s expectations. The results show that Amazon is bracing for uncertainty related to President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs. The company landed in the crosshairs of the White House this week over a report that Amazon planned to show shoppers the cost of the tariffs. Trump personally called Bezos to complain, and Amazon clarified that no such change was coming. Bezos previously offloaded about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon shares last year, marking his first sale of company stock since 2021. Since handing over the Amazon CEO role to Andy Jassy, Bezos has spent more of his time on his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his $10 billion climate and biodiversity fund. He’s used Amazon share sales to help fund Blue Origin, as well as the Day One Fund, which he launched in September 2018 to provide education in low-income communities and combat homelessness.

"Until NFL investigation ends, Justin Tucker could have a difficult time finding a new team",The Ravens have released kicker Justin Tucker. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/until-nfl-investigation-ends-justin-tucker-could-have-a-difficult-time-finding-a-new-team?cid=nbcnews,"The Ravens have released kicker Justin Tucker. Once the transaction becomes official (presumably today), Tucker will become a free agent. In theory, he’ll be able to sign immediately with any team. As a practical matter, any interested team will likely wait. The NFL’s investigation regarding the allegations made against Tucker (he denies them all) will continue. He could eventually be suspended. It’s sensible to assume that teams will wait for the decision to be made — and the suspension, if any, to be served — before offering him a roster spot. Beyond the potential P.R. impact of bringing a kicker who doesn’t kick as well as he once did to town, Tucker’s next team won’t know when it will be able to use him until the suspension, if any, is served. If that’s how it plays out, it becomes important for Tucker to get this behind him as soon as he can. If it lingers into the 2025 season, he’ll be essentially suspended. That could make a negotiated outcome more attractive to him, with Tucker’s representatives and the league reaching an agreement on a number of games. The 2020 CBA changed the landscape regarding Personal Conduct Policy cases. Now, a third party conducts a hearing and makes findings of fact that cannot be appealed. There’s risk for both sides. Judge Sue L. Robinson (who handled the Deshaun Watson case in 2022) could find that the evidence shows wrongdoing by Tucker. She also could find that the evidence falls short of proving that he did anything. Still, if it lingers, Tucker loses. He needs to get this resolved by Week 1, if his goal is to end up with a new team as soon as possible. It’s still possible for a new team to decide to give him a shot, knowing that if/when he’s suspended, another kicker will be needed. Still, few teams will want to embrace the scrutiny that would go along with welcoming Tucker to town under the cloud of unresolved allegations involving misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. Especially since the supply of competent kickers always outweighs the demand — and since Tucker wasn’t in 2024 the kicker he used to be.

"Ted Cruz: NFL has been ""tiptoeing up to the rule"" protecting college and high school football","Hearing on broadcast vs. streaming could spark new legislation, eventually. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/ted-cruz-nfl-has-been-tiptoeing-up-to-the-rule-protecting-college-and-high-school-football?cid=nbcnews,"The Senate Commerce Committee has proceeded with a hearing on the pivot from sports broadcasting to streaming, without any involvement by the NFL. (Commissioner Roger Goodell declined an invitation to appear.) In his opening comments, Committee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) made a pointed comment about the NFL. He said the league has been “tiptoeing up to” the line that protects college and high school football from being diluted by pro football. The line appears in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1960, which gave the NFL a broadcast antitrust exemption with one key concession — the NFL cannot broadcast games from the second weekend in September through the second weekend in December on Friday night or Saturday. “One growing concern is that the NFL has used its special exemption in the SBA to the frustration of college and high school football schedulers,” Cruz said, via a transcript provided by the Committee. “For example, the SBA explicitly excludes antitrust protection for the NFL if broadcasting a game on a Friday night or a Saturday between mid-September to mid-December. That’s to protect the interests of high school and college football, and ultimately, their fans who are no doubt also followers of the NFL. “The NFL has tiptoed up to this rule, now putting a game on streaming on Black Friday afternoon, which used to be a slot reserved for prominent college football rivalries, including in some years, Texas and Texas A&M. There are millions of sports fans who like being able to follow high school, college, and professional football without having to choose amongst them. And it’s partly why Congress wrote the SBA in the manner it did.” Cruz mentioned only the Black Friday game, which starts at 3:00 p.m. ET and ideally ends before the 6:00 p.m. ET witching hour, in support of his observation. The league also has started streaming games on the first Friday of September, when the first Friday coincides with the first week of the NFL season — and clearly conflicts with high school football. There has been speculation that, with the Republican party controlling the White House and Congress, the NFL may press for revisions to the SBA that would eliminate the Friday night and/or Saturday exception. Given that a prominent Republican senator seems to be firmly in favor of enforcing the limits of the current law, Cruz likely would be against allowing the NFL to broadcast games within the current window that is regarded as off-limits. The broader question is whether streaming fits within the SBA at all. That could be a question for the courts. Or it could become a subject for further legislation. Today’s hearing seems to be a step toward considering something that would counter the exodus of live pro sports from free TV to pay TV.

Billy Horschel's Ryder Cup dreams likely dashed with this announcement,Horschel revealed Tuesday that he will be sidelined until at least late summer because of right hip surgery that will take place next week in Colorado. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/golf/news/billy-horschels-ryder-cup-dreams-likely-dashed-with-this-announcement?cid=nbcnews,"Billy Horschel’s Ryder Cup dreams are likely dashed – for this year at least. Horschel announced Tuesday morning that he is set to undergo right hip surgery early next week in Colorado and will be sidelined multiple months, perhaps the rest of this season. “It’s an unfortunate situation with so many great events left on the calendar, but this is a preventative measure,” Horschel said. “I’m already itching to start rehab, get back to practicing, and I look forward to returning to the course sometime around late summer/early fall.” Horschel withdrew from the Zurich Classic, where he was set to partner with Tom Hoge, citing a lower body injury. The 38-year-old Horschel had made 12 starts this season, posting two top-10s but also missing five cuts. He currently sits No. 58 in FedExCup points, No. 24 in the Official World Golf Ranking and No. 16 in U.S. Ryder Cup points. Horschel also competed in the inaugural season of TGL, where his Atlanta Drive GC won the title. Horschel’s performance, passion and energy while playing on that team prompted many to tab him for a potential Ryder Cup debut this fall at Bethpage. The matches are scheduled for Sept. 25-28, so even if Horschel returns before then, he would need to receive a captain’s pick from Keegan Bradley, and even then, he likely would not have many, if any, reps. “Every time we’re in a Ryder Cup year, I’m very well aware that I haven’t been part of a Ryder Cup team,” Horschel told Golf Channel on April 1. “But I can’t solely focus on that. I can’t have that be the driving force. At the end of the day, I’ve got to try and continue to get better as a player, continue to improve as a person, and hopefully through those gains and improvement, I can finally make a Ryder Cup team. I’ve done a lot of things in my career that I’m very grateful for and the wins I’ve had, and do I feel like I should be on a Ryder Cup team? Yeah, but have I done what I need to in terms of playing three, four, five months of consistent golf leading into the Ryder Cup? I haven’t done that, and that’s sort of been the Achilles heel a little bit; I just haven’t played as well over a period of time as the other 12 guys. “I’m in the best situation that I think I’ve ever been in my career, at this stage, six months out from a Ryder Cup. I think if I can continue to improve and continue to play well and play consistently well, hopefully it lends itself to being a part of a Ryder Cup team. “I would love to be a part of that zoo in New York. … It’s going to be the craziest Ryder Cup ever.” DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Nylander has 2 goals and an assist as Maple Leafs beat Panthers 5-4 in Game 1 of 2nd round series,"Matthew Knies and Chris Tanev each had a goal and an assist, and Morgan Rielly also scored for the Maple Leafs. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nhl/news/nylander-has-2-goals-and-an-assist-as-maple-leafs-beat-panthers-5-4-in-game-1-of-2nd-round-series?cid=nbcnews,"John E. Sokolowski-Imagn Images TORONTO (AP) William Nylander got the Toronto Maple Leafs off to a fast start in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Nylander scored twice in the first period before adding an assist as Toronto built a big lead before holding on to beat the Florida Panthers 5-4 on Monday night in the series opener. Matthew Knies and Chris Tanev each had a goal and an assist, and Morgan Rielly also scored for the Maple Leafs. Max Pacioretty and Jake McCabe each had two assists. “We’ve been in tight games throughout the season,” Nylander said. “We dug into that and tried to bear down.” Anthony Stolars stopped eight of the nine shots he faced before leaving in the second period after he took an elbow to the head from Panthers forward Sam Bennett, who wasn’t penalized on the play. The Maple Leafs said the 31-year-old was being evaluated, but provided no further update. “Elbow to the head,” Toronto coach Craig Berube said. “Clear as day. ... I get it, they miss calls. But it’s clearly a penalty.” Joseph Woll stopped 17 shots in relief. Seth Jones, Eetu Luostarinen, Uvis Balinskis and Sam Bennett scored for the Panthers, and Brad Marchand and Carter Verhaeghe each had two assists. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 24 shots. Florida beat Toronto in five games in the second round in the 2023 playoffs on the way to reaching the Stanley Cup Final. The Panthers went one step further last year when they won the Cup for the first time in franchise history. Game 2 is Wednesday back at Scotiabank Arena, before shifting to South Florida for two games. Toronto opened the scoring just 33 seconds after puck drop when Nylander beat Bobrovsky through the five-hole from a tight angle for his fourth goal of the playoffs. The Maple Leafs, who beat Ottawa in six games in the first round to register just the second series win for the Original Six franchise in more than two decades, went up 2-0 with 7:09 left in the first when Nylander scooped up a rebound before deking Bobrovsky to the ice and roofing his second of the period. “He came out and was feeling it,” Rielly said of the slick winger. “That helps set the tone.” Jones got the Panthers on the board with a shot from the point through traffic on a power play with 3:03 remaining for his second of the postseason. Toronto restored its two-goal lead just 19 seconds later when Nylander sent Rielly off to the races on a 2-on-1 with John Tavares. The defenseman and longest serving member of the current roster looked Bobrovsky off before firing past the goalie’s blocker for his third of the postseason. “Obviously it wasn’t a great start by us,” Panthers forward Aleksander Barkov said. “We knew they were going to come hard and strong.” Florida, which beat the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games to advance, got a man advantage in the second that saw Stolarz make a couple of stops, but Bennett caught him with a sneaky elbow to the back of the head. Toronto made it 4-1 at 7:50 when Tanev’s knuckling shot from distance fooled Bobrovsky for his first. Stolarz, who backed up Bobrovsky on the way to Florida’s Cup win a year ago, was seen on television vomiting by the bench a few minutes later before getting replaced by Woll. Nylander had a chance to complete the first playoff hat trick of his career on a shot that knocked the stick out of Bobrovsky’s hand but the puck stayed out as the Maple Leafs headed to the locker room up three. Luostarinen cut the deficit back to two on a redirection 1:41 into the third, and Balinskis then made it 4-3 at 4:30 after a Panthers push inside a suddenly tense building. “We didn’t look like ourselves,” Florida head coach Paul Maurice said of his team’s opening period. “And then (we) righted it in the second and after that had a pretty good push in the third.” Toronto failed to connect on two power plays later in third before Bobrovsky denied Max Domi on a break. Knies made it 5-3 with 6 minutes left in regulation with a move to the backhand on another breakaway. Bennett got his team back within one with 1:55 left in regulation on a pinballed shot off a Toronto stick, but Woll and the Maple Leafs held the fort late to secure an early lead in the series. “That was nice for us,” Nylander said. “But we’re just focused on next game now.” The Panthers were without defenseman Aaron Ekblad, who finished off a two-game suspension for his headshot on Tampa Bay forward Brandon Hagel in the opening round. The Maple Leafs have three players from the Panthers’ championship team - Stolarz, defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Steven Lorentz.

NASCAR Championship Weekend moving to Homestead in 2026,NASCAR will begin rotating sites for the championship race in 2026. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nascar/news/nascar-championship-weekend-moving-to-homestead-in-2026?cid=nbcnews,"NASCAR’s Championship Weekend will return to Homestead-Miami Speedway in 2026, the sanctioning body announced Tuesday morning. NASCAR also announced that it will rotate its season finale for the Cup, Xfinity and Craftsman Truck Series starting next year among “NASCAR’s marquee venues and key markets.” NBC Sports, which has broadcast the Cup playoffs and championship race since 2015, will do so through 2031. Phoenix, which has hosted NASCAR’s Championship Weekend since 2020, will be among the rotating sites for the season-ending race for each series. NASCAR also announced that Phoenix will host two Cup weekends next year and that the track’s second race weekend will be in the third round of the playoffs. Those dates will be announced later. Homestead-Miami Speedway’s Championship Weekend will be Nov. 6-8 in 2026. Homestead hosted the championship races for Cup, Xfinity and Trucks from 2002-19 before the season finale moved to Phoenix. “Homestead-Miami Speedway has a history of competitive, championship racing that will provide nostalgia for veteran drivers and fans and exhilaration for NASCAR’s new generation,” said Ben Kennedy, EVP, Chief Venue & Racing Innovation Officer, in a statement. “As we move forward, the rotating model will provide new challenges for competitors as well as opportunities for unique venues to host our loyal fans at NASCAR Championship Weekend.” Kyle Larson won the most recent Cup race at Homestead, taking the checkered flag in March in a race that had 27 lead changes. Last fall’s playoff race at Homestead saw Tyler Reddick win after going from third to first on the last lap. The last three laps each had a different leader in that event. “This place is awesome,” said Christopher Bell, who finished fourth in that race and watched those lead changes ahead of him. “It leads to some amazing races.” He’s not the only driver who feels that way. “It’s just an awesome race track,” Larson said of Homestead this season. “Definitely the best across all the series in our sport. It’s just fun. It races kind of similar in all the divisions. It’s just a cool place.” DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

A key ruling in Jon Gruden's pending lawsuit could come at any time,"In Monday's item about former Raiders, Buccaneers, and Raiders coach Jon Gruden joining the AF1's Nashville Kats as a part owner and adviser, we mentioned his pending lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/a-key-ruling-in-jon-grudens-pending-lawsuit-could-come-at-any-time?cid=nbcnews,"In Monday’s item about former Raiders, Buccaneers, and Raiders coach Jon Gruden joining the AF1’s Nashville Kats as a part owner and adviser, we mentioned his pending lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. There’s been no news about the case in months, so we checked on its status. The litigation is still pending before the Nevada Supreme Court on a rehearing before the full court as to the question of whether the case will proceed in court, or whether it will be sent to the NFL’s in-house arbitration system, also known in some places (here) as a secret, rigged, kangaroo court. A ruling. we’re told, could come at any time. The last order was issued on October 10, 2024, with the Nevada Supreme Court granting the request for “en banc” reconsideration — and explaining that the decision would be made based on the existing briefs and official record. Gruden won at the trial court level on the question of whether the case should remain in the Nevada court system. The NFL prevailed before a three-judge panel of the Nevada Supreme Court. At least two judges of the full court agreed to conduct a rehearing before all seven judges. Gruden lost, 2-1, before the three judges who considered the case the first time around. Now, with seven judges on the full court, Gruden will need at least four to agree with his position that the NFL should not be permitted to seize on a very aggressive interpretation of the league’s Constitution and Bylaws to pull the dispute into arbitration. Beyond the question of whether the NFL Constitution and Bylaws justify mandatory arbitration of Gruden’s case is the broader issue regarding whether the Commissioner should have ultimate authority over legal claims made against the NFL generally and/or the Commissioner specifically. However it plays out, the issue seems to be destined for the U.S. Supreme Court. Which currently has more than enough pro-business judges to deliver a win for the NFL. Even if Gruden shares the same general political views that could eventually torpedo his case.

"Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Golden State Warriors Preview: 2025 NBA Playoffs series prediction, schedule",This is only the third ever meeting of the No. 6 and No. 7 seeds in the playoffs. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/minnesota-timberwolves-vs-golden-state-warriors-preview-2025-nba-playoffs-series-prediction-schedule?cid=nbcnews,"This is only the third time in NBA history that the No. 6 and No. 7 seeds meet in the playoffs. However, the last time was two years ago and also included the Warriors (vs. Lakers, a series won by Los Angeles, who was then swept in the conference finals by eventual champion Denver). Here is what to know from this series. Minnesota travels to Golden State for the series opener on Tuesday night, May 6, at 9:30 p.m. Eastern. This is a fast turnaround for the Warriors, who played in a Game 7 in Houston on Sunday. All times are Eastern (* = if necessary) Game 1: Warriors at Timberwolves (Tue. May 6, 9:30 ET, TNT) Game 2: Warriors at Timberwolves (Thu. May 8, 8:30 ET, TNT) Game 3: Timberwolves at Warriors (Sat. May 10, 8:30 ET, ABC) Game 4: Timberwolves at Warriors (Mon. May 12, 10 ET, ESPN) Game 5: Warriors at Timberwolves (Wed. May 14, TBD, TNT)* Game 6: Timberwolves at Warriors (Sun. May 18, TBD, TBD)* Game 7: Warriors at Timberwolves (Tue. May 20, 8:30 ET, ESPN)* Nobody guarded Stephen Curry more in the regular season than Jaden McDaniels. Per NBA.com, McDaniels spent 28:40 matched up with Curry across four regular season matchups. The next closest was Keegan Murray at 18:50. Curry averaged 28.8 points per game against Minnesota in the regular season, and the Warriors went 3-1 in their matchups. The last time these teams played was in January, and Golden State’s lineup looks quite different. That shouldn’t change things for McDaniels, who averaged four fouls per game in the first round. They need him on the floor and making life difficult for Curry. McDaniels enjoyed the best statistical season of his career this year, and that translated into 17.4 points per game in the first round. The Warriors’ defense will be keyed in on slowing down Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle, and McDaniels will need to step up as a scorer. He only averaged 10.8 points per game against the Warriors in the regular season. This series is a big opportunity for him on both ends of the floor. —Noah Rubin, Rotoworld basketball analyst Golden State’s most-used lineup — and arguably best — in the first round was a small-ball five with Stephen Curry, Brandin Podziemski, Buddy Hield, Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green at center (it had a +13.9 net rating). That lineup will struggle to defend a huge Minnesota starting five of Mike Conley, Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert. It’s an issue of size. Steve Kerr can start Butler on Ant and Green on Randle to try and slow the two Minnesota shot creators (or swap the Butler/Green assignments), but there are potential mismatches elsewhere, such as who guards Gobert? The French big man punished the Lakers in the last series when they went small (particularly in the closeout game). Kerr could play a lot of Kevon Looney to match up with Gobert, but that still leaves a smaller player on McDaniels while at the same time hurting the Warriors’ offense. Gary Payton II could get heavy minutes this season because of his defense. Golden State’s ultimate concern is this: A big Minnesota team plays nearly as good of defense as Houston, but led by Edwards, the Timberwolves’ offense is exponentially better. Especially if Randle plays at the level he did against the Lakers. There’s more than a little history here. In a playoffs where the referees have permitted — if not outright green lit — increased physicality, letting Green and Gobert go at it with the proverbial gloves off could impact the series. Another thing to watch with Green and Gobert: Will one have a big offensive impact in a game or games? When they did (Gobert in Game 5 vs. the Lakers, Green early in Game 7 vs. the Rockets), it’s a huge boost for their team. —Kurt Helin, NBC Sports lead NBA writer Minnesota is a version of Houston that can actually score. The Wolves will give GSW a lot of the same issues the Rockets did - size, athleticism, speed - but instead of Jalen Green as chief protagonist on offense it’ll be Anthony Edwards. This Minnesota team looks improved on last year’s version that entered the conference finals as heavy favorite - they’re more versatile now and can play more styles. Their ability to play super big, or go 5 out with elite spacing and switching, should be too much for Golden State. Golden State has the best offensive player in the series with Steph and the experience with vet players and coach, but the numbers look bad in terms of overall matchup here, and the Warriors are coming out of a truly physical seven-game series that may have taken the wind out of their sails. Minnesota has had a propensity for playing with their food so I’m prepared to be wrong and would love a better price for them in series than what is currently available but it’s looking like a clean win for Minnesota to me. Before the playoffs tipped off, I predicted Golden State would advance to the Western Conference Finals, but after seeing Minnesota in person in the first round and watching the Warriors vs. Rockets games, I changed my mind. Anthony Edwards is ready for his star turn and will be the best player in this series (sorry, Steph), the Timberwolves’ defense will challenge the Warriors as much or more than Houston, and Minnesota brings size across the board that Golden State will struggle to handle. The Warriors with Butler will not go quietly, but this is a rough matchup for them, if they thought the Rockets were physical… DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Knicks vs. Celtics Game 1: New York steals (Mikal Bridges literally) Game 1 from Boston in overtime thriller,Celtics set a playoff record with 45 missed 3-pointers in a game where they launched 60. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/new-york-steals-mikal-bridges-literally-game-1-from-boston-in-overtime-thriller?cid=nbcnews,"Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, were you happy with your team’s shot selection in Game 1? “For the most part,” he answered. That explains a lot of this game. Boston followed Mazzulla’s blueprint and launched 60 3-pointers in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference Semi-Final matchup with New York, missing 45 (an NBA playoff record) and hitting just 15, or 25%. Boston shooters missed a lot of open ones, but they also took a lot of difficult, contested ones, as well as tough shots in the paint. “Some of them felt good, some of them felt like we maybe forced the issue,” Jaylen Brown said. “Definitely our rhythm and our timing was a little bit off. We got a lot of great looks, but there may be some truth to that. We’ve got to look at the film and see what happened in that second half.” The Celtics had success early with matchup hunting — Jayson Tatum going after Karl-Anthony Towns, getting the big man in foul trouble — and led by as many as 20 in the third quarter. Then Boston’s shooting dried up. The Knicks were the definition of resilient — they could have rolled over down 20 but didn’t. With a 20-6 run in the second half of the third quarter, New York stormed back to make it a game. Jalen Brunson was doing his own matchup hunting, going at Al Horford, and it worked. The game went to overtime, and Mikal Bridges’ defense sealed it more than anything. The result was a 108-105 New York win that has the Knicks up 1-0 on the road and left Celtics faithful stunned and confused. Boston, as it had at points during the regular season, stuck with what wasn’t working and didn’t shift enough to getting buckets in the paint, or even good looks from the midrange (the Celtics were 6-of-15 on shots from four feet out to the arc). The result was opening the door for New York, but Boston saw this more as just missed shots. “Probably some times where we settled,” said Jayson Tatum, who finished with 29 points but was 0-of-7 shooting in the fourth quarter. “I could’ve put more pressure on the rim. But a lot of times, we felt like we got really, really good looks and just couldn’t convert.” Meanwhile, Jalen Brunson just kept making plays on his way to 29 points, and OG Anunoby matched him bucket for bucket. While the Celtics were missing, the Knicks hit 17 3-pointers, shooting 45.9% from beyond the arc. In last year’s playoffs, an injury or just an off night for Boston didn’t automatically mean a loss, as it cruised to the title. That is not going to be the case this season. If the Celtics want to repeat, they must play closer to their peak. They did not on Monday night and now find themselves in a hole against a resiliant Knicks team that is playing with great confidence and believes it can win this series.

"New York Islanders win the NHL draft lottery, securing the No. 1 selection. Sharks will pick second","The New York Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot — the 10th-best odds — of seeing their numbers come up. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nhl/news/new-york-islanders-win-the-nhl-draft-lottery-securing-the-no-1-selection-sharks-will-pick-second?cid=nbcnews,"New York Islanders pro scouting director Ken Morrow knows a thing or two about so-called hockey miracles. Witnessing the Islanders win the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vault nine other teams in the order for the right to have the No. 1 pick represented yet another memorable moment for the four-time Stanley Cup champion and member of the 1980 gold-medal-winning “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic team. “I’ve had a lot of thrills in my hockey life, but this is right up there at the top,” Morrow said. “The hockey gods smiled on us. I can’t tell you how thrilled I am for Islanders fans, for our ownership, for the entire Islanders organization.” The Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, are in the midst of a front-office shakeup after not renewing general manager Lou Lamoriello’s contract on April 22. And they earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot — the 10th-best odds — of seeing their numbers come up. New York wasn’t the only team to buck the lottery odds. The Utah Hockey Club won the second round of the lottery, and made the jump from 14th to fourth under the rules limiting teams from moving up no more than 10 spots in the draft order. “A couple of seconds ago, we were just like 10 back, so it still hasn’t sunk in,” Utah GM Bill Armstrong said of a first-year franchise that finished just seven points out of a playoff spot. “This is an exciting moment for us. It’s a game-changer for us.” The San Jose Sharks will pick second after entering the day with the best odds, 18.5%, to win the lottery and a 25.5% chance of landing the No. 1 choice. San Jose, which finished last for a second consecutive year, was seeking to become the NHL’s first team to win the lottery and pick first in consecutive years. “We definitely lucked it out last year to be able to select Mac,” Sharks GM Mike Grier said in referring to selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall. “This year would have obviously been nice to have the pick and have the choice of all the players. But picking two, we’re still in a pretty good spot so we’re happy.” The Chicago Blackhawks had the second-best chances to win the lottery and will pick third. The remaining 12 teams moved two spots back in the order, starting with Nashville dropping from third to fifth. The final 16 draft spots will be determined following the playoffs. The Islanders have the right to pick first for the fifth time in team history, and first since selecting John Tavares with the No. 1 choice in 2009. This year’s draft will be held in Los Angeles with the first round taking place on June 27, followed by the final six rounds the next day. Top prospects will convene for the weeklong predraft combine being held in Buffalo next month. The prospect pool is not considered as deep at the top as last year’s class, or next year’s group, with Canadian junior forward Gavin McKenna long regarded as the No. 1 candidate. Erie Otters defenseman Matthew Schaefer is NHL Central Scouting’s top-ranked North American prospect followed by OHL Saginaw center Michael Misa and Boston College center James Hagens, the top-ranked U.S. born prospect. Hagens is from Long Island and grew up an Islanders fan. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 183 pounds, Schaefer maintained his No. 1 position despite missing the final three months of the season after breaking his right collarbone representing Canada at the world junior championships in December. Schaefer has the potential of becoming only the fifth defenseman selected No. 1 since 2000, and first since Buffalo chose Owen Power in 2021. And he also has the chance of being the first OHL player to go No. 1 since Edmonton drafted Erie’s Connor McDavid in 2015. The top-ranked international skaters are center Anton Frondell and right wing Victor Eklund, who are teammates with Djurgarden of Sweden’s second division league. New York’s jump from 10th to first is the biggest involving a team winning the No. 1 selection. And it comes after the last-place team won the lottery to retain the first pick in four of the past five years and 12 times overall since the NHL launched the format in 1995. The New York Rangers enjoyed the previous largest move up to No. 1 in 2020, when they were grouped among eight teams — ranked eighth to 15th — with the same odds to win the lottery after being eliminated in the COVID-altered play-in round of the expanded 24-team playoff format. The lottery was held at the NHL Network studios in New Jersey, and conducted live for the first time in the event’s 30-year history. Previously, the lottery was held shortly before the broadcast in front of a limited audience of sequestered observers, followed by the draft selections being revealed in reverse order.

Nuggets vs. Thunder Game 1: Aaron Gordon 3-pointer caps Denver comeback to steal Game 1 in Oklahoma City,Nikola Jokic was the best player on the floor with 42 points and 22 rebounds. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/aaron-gordon-3-pointer-caps-19-6-denver-run-to-come-from-behind-steal-game-1-in-oklahoma-city-121-119?cid=nbcnews,"In a span of less than five minutes Monday night, the “Oklahoma City isn’t ready for this” crowd got all the ammunition it needed. The Thunder led most of the night by double-digits, by 13 at one point in the fourth quarter and by 11 with 4:31 left after a Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 3-pointer. All OKC needed was its league-best defense to do its job and it would have another home playoff win. Then Denver went on a 19-6 run to close the game, capped off by another Aaron Gordon clutch moment, this one a game-winning 3-pointer. That combined with a 42-point, 22-rebound night from Nikola Jokic earned a resilient Denver Nuggets team a 121-119 road win and a 1-0 lead in this Western Conference Semi-Final series. Game 2 is Wednesday night in Oklahoma City. This is a heartbreaking loss for the Thunder, who were up by double-digits most of the night but could not close it out. “We’re gonna find out what we’re made of,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after the loss. He finished the night with 33 points on 12-of-26 shooting. If Oklahoma City wants to know why it lost, or if Denver wants to know why it won, there are two key things (in addition to Jokic being the best player on the court): 1) Offensive rebounds. Denver had 21 of them, leading to 27 second-chance points. Gordon had seven of those rebounds. 2) Missed free throws. Oklahoma City was 20-of-28 from the line, and no two misses were as critical as Chet Holmgren’s two with 9.5 seconds left in the game and the Thunder up one. Holmgren’s teammates rightly pointed out this game was not lost in the last 15 seconds; this was a night of mistakes by the Thunder that left the door open just enough for Aaron Gordon to come barging through and get the win. Gordon finished with 22 points and 14 rebounds for Denver, while Jamal Murray added 21 points and six assists. For the Thunder, after SGA’s 33, there was 20 off the bench from Alex Caruso, who also had five steals and played a fantastic game. Jalen Williams has to be better, 16 points on 5-of-20 shooting is not good enough.

Former Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who inevitably will join Strahan in Canton, has a separate bid in the works. He reportedly had “preliminary conversations” about joining Strahan’s group, but Eli ultimately decided to go it alone. The Strahan-Lasry combo is the latest example of the newest dynamic when it comes to minority NFL ownership, sparked by the ever-skyrocket value of teams. A rich guy with significant name recognition in league circles combines with a really rich guy with no existing pro football footprint to come up with the cash necessary to do the deal. Presumably, the Giants are looking for market value for the interest they’re selling. Raiders owner Mark Davis opted to give Tom Brady a steep discount for the value of his involvement in football operations. Most owners won’t leave that many millions on the table, when they can hire proven football executives for far, far less than that. Especially not for a player who never played for the team. In New York, where both Strahan and Manning have their numbers retired (unless and until the Giants draft a player who asks to wear it), the Giants likely won’t be retiring the age-old habit of seeking the best deal possible for what they are selling.

"Jalen Milroe working to become a more ""efficient passer"" ahead of rookie season","Jalen Milroe was a successful quarterback at Alabama, but his ability to make plays with his feet led to discussion heading into the draft about whether he'd be used in other ways as an NFL player. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/jalen-milroe-working-to-become-a-more-efficient-passer-ahead-of-rookie-season?cid=nbcnews,"Jalen Milroe was a successful quarterback at Alabama, but his ability to make plays with his feet led to discussion heading into the draft about whether he’d be used in other ways as an NFL player. Milroe was adamant that he’s only a quarterback and Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said the same thing after Seattle took Milroe in the third round last month. That may settle one question, but it doesn’t guarantee that Milroe is going to get a chance to show that he can handle the starting job. The rookie has been working with quarterback coach Jordan Palmer to help his bid and Milroe explained some of what he’s been doing during the team’s rookie minicamp. “The biggest thing is everything works from the ground up at the quarterback position,” Milroe said, via Seattle Sports. “It’s understanding the lower-half mechanics of how I operate. Every quarterback is different, and so . . . it’s understanding how to distribute my body when it comes to the lower-half mechanics. That’s been a focus for us. It’s all about being an efficient passer. And so the more you work, the more you understand your body, you’re going to be more of an efficient passer. So that’s something that we continue to work on.” With Sam Darnold and Drew Lock on the roster in Seattle, practice reps are going to be limited for Milroe so his extracurricular work will be all the more significant as he tries to work his way onto the field.

"Barry Sanders thinks Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery can lead the Lions to a Super Bowl",Saquon Barkley's big season with the Eagles has led to renewed talk that NFL teams can ride a running back to the Super Bowl. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/barry-sanders-thinks-jahmyr-gibbs-david-montgomery-can-lead-the-lions-to-a-super-bowl?cid=nbcnews,"Saquon Barkley’s big season with the Eagles has led to renewed talk that NFL teams can ride a running back to the Super Bowl. Or in the case of the Lions, perhaps ride two running backs to the Super Bowl. Barry Sanders, who won only one playoff game during his Hall of Fame career with the Lions, told USA Today that he thinks the combination of Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery can give the Lions a championship offense, revolving around its running game. “They’re the best duo in the NFL and there’s no reason that’s going to change any time soon,” Sanders said. “If a Super Bowl is in our future, in our near future, you would think those two guys would be a big part of it.” Sanders said he’s been a fan of Montgomery’s since before the Lions signed him, and that Gibbs showed when Montgomery missed time with a knee injury last season that he’s also more than capable of being a No. 1 running back. “David Montgomery, he’s been a great running back in the NFL for many years, and he just added to that coming over from the Bears and putting him with this Lions offensive line,” Sanders said. “And then, you see what Jahmyr Gibbs was able to do last season, really from the time, the last two years that he’s been here, but I felt like last year was more of a breakout season for him.” It was the Lions’ best regular season in almost 70 years, but it fizzled in the playoffs. If the Lions are ever going to get over the hump in the postseason, Sanders thinks it will be on the back of their running game.

A second person has been charged with murder of reporter during Super Bowl week,Another suspect has been charged with killing a Kansas City-based reporter during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/a-second-person-has-been-charged-with-murder-of-reporter-during-super-bowl-week?cid=nbcnews,"Another suspect has been charged with killing a Kansas City-based reporter during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. Via the Associated Press, Louisiana authorities announced on Monday that Rickey White, 34, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the death of 27-year-old Adan Manzano, a reporter and anchor for Telemundo. White is the alleged accomplice of 48-year-old Danette Colbert, who was charged in March. That same month, White was arrested in Florida on robbery and fraud charges related to Manzano’s murder. White was then extradited to Louisiana. Attorney Kevin Boshea, who represents White, told the AP that he has not been informed of the murder charge. “I don’t think he’s guilty of the other crimes, so how can he be guilty of murder?” Boshea said. An autopsy revealed that Manzano died while face down in a pillow, after ingesting alcohol and Xanax. Surveillance video showed Manzano and Colbert entering Manzano’s hotel room on the day he died. Colbert left an hour later. Police say she then used Manzano’s credit cards to make purchases in the area. As noted by the AP, Louisiana law defines second-degree murder as, in part, distributing drugs that cause death or committing certain crimes, like robbery, that result in death. Authorities said that Manzano had no prescription for Xanax, and that Xanax was found at Colbert’s home. The murder charge against White could potentially result in a plea deal in exchange for testimony that would be used to convict Colbert. Or, if the evidence is deemed to be strong enough, prosecutors could try to get a murder conviction of both defendants.

"Matthew Stafford, Rams will have another early offseason of uncertainty","In the NFL, no deal is ever done until it's done. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/matthew-stafford-rams-will-have-another-early-offseason-of-uncertainty?cid=nbcnews,"In the NFL, no deal is ever done until it’s done. Now that quarterback Matthew Stafford’s new deal with the Rams is officially done, the two-year deal will once again tee up the question, after the next season, of whether the Rams and Stafford are done. He ends up with $44 million this year, with no guarantees beyond 2025 — for injury or otherwise. The Rams will have until the fifth day of the next league year in March, when his 2026 salary of $40 million becomes fully guaranteed, to cut him. The Rams also will have the ability to trade Stafford, since they’ll hold his contractual rights through 2026. We don’t, and won’t, know whether the Rams have informally agreed to grant Stafford his outright release, if he decides he wants to finish his career elsewhere. If a new team can sign him without giving the Rams a draft pick or two, that’s more money they’ll be willing to pay Stafford next year. He could have gotten a firm $90 million (or more) on a two-year deal with the Raiders or Giants. But Stafford seems to be content to go one year at a time with the Rams, confident that another team (if not the Rams) will pay him fairly in 2026. It’s a good deal for the Rams. At $42 million per year on his new contract, Stafford currently ranks 15th in the NFL. And he’s still better than the 15th best quarterback. And Stafford, unlike plenty of starting quarterbacks, is willing to play in the current year with no financial security beyond it.

NFL declines comment on proposed White House cuts to TBI research and education,Commissioner Roger Goodell went to Washington on Monday. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-declines-comment-on-proposed-white-house-cuts-to-tbi-research-and-education?cid=nbcnews,"Commissioner Roger Goodell went to Washington on Monday. While he was standing in the Oval Office, a report emerged from ESPN.com regarding a White House proposal to slash millions from the budget for traumatic brain injury research and education. In response to an email from PFT, the NFL has declined comment on the development. It’s really no surprise. The league seems to be fully committed to achieving peaceful coexistence with the current administration. At a time when a slew of executive orders have various industries scrambling, the NFL is trying to make no sudden moves. Speaking out against the potential elimination of federal funding for a cause about which the NFL claims to be passionate would fall into that category. It will be far better — and, in the grand scheme of things, cheaper — for the NFL to fund TBI research and education efforts on its own. It’s part of the complex, but not all that complicated, dance in which the NFL must engage to properly navigate the current political waters. Basically, the strategy consists of avoiding the iceberg. And everybody knows what the iceberg is. As Goodell’s comments from Monday’s event proved, he’s willing to say all the right things, not say any of the wrong things, swallow his pride in the presence of someone who once called him a “dope,” and chart a course toward open waters and far smoother sailing than the likes of Harvard and multiple major law firms are currently experiencing. It’s not difficult to do it, once the decision is made to play the game with the overriding goal of winning. And the rewards include not only the avoidance of overt pressure to dump the Rooney Rule but also a draft in D.C., a stadium in D.C., and four years without holding their breath and waiting for a broadside attack against the league’s interests.

"Ravens made a ""football decision"" (wink, nod) about Justin Tucker","P.R. fallout be damned, the team carefully avoided a potential CBA issue. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/ravens-made-a-football-decision-wink-nod-about-justin-tucker?cid=nbcnews,"The Ravens have been in a delicate spot from the moment the first allegations surfaced in January against kicker Justin Tucker. On Monday, they made an indelicate exit from the relationship. On one hand, there have been no findings that Tucker has done anything wrong, in civil court, criminal court, or the Court of Commissioner Goodell. Indeed, Tucker has unequivocally denied the numerous accusations of misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. On the other hand, he plays a position that is as interchangeable as they come. Especially since Tucker has regressed from his previous perennial Pro Bowl-level performance. When faced with the choice between a run-of-the-mill kicker who is creating a significant distraction and is due to make $4.2 million this year and one who isn’t, it’s a no-brainer. And with run-of-the-mill kickers available anywhere and everywhere, the Ravens were always going to be moving on from Tucker. They opted to do the dance. To wait until after the start of the new league year in March, when Tucker could be released with a post-June 1 designation and significant 2025 cap savings. To wait until after they could use a sixth-round pick on Arizona kicker Tyler Loop, without their potential selection of a kicker during the draft being obvious. To wait until they could get a look at Loop during this weekend’s rookie minicamp. The fact that it was couched by G.M. Eric DeCosta as a “football decision” is no surprise. Players are released for football reasons all the time. There’s no mechanism in the Collective Bargaining Agreement for challenging the constant churn of football decisions. If the decision was influenced (as it likely was) in whole or in part by non-football reasons, the Ravens would have invited a potential CBA issue by saying so. At a minimum, Tucker could have argued under the “one punishment” principle that the team’s decision to release him in the aftermath of the allegations should short-circuit the pending Personal Conduct Policy investigation. (He still could.) This was all strategic and calculated by the Ravens, as all best-interests-of-the-team decisions are. After the Ravens’ 2024 playoff run ended, DeCosta said he expects Tucker to be the Ravens’ kicker in 2025. Then came the allegations. Instead of immediately applying a supposed “zero tolerance” policy to Tucker, the Ravens waited. They weathered a P.R. storm that was more like a light drizzle. And they were able to wait for the draft (and rookie minicamp) to come and go before making a move. On Sunday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh emphasized that the team would make football decisions only about Tucker. The next day, they made one. It most likely wasn’t only a football decision. But there’s no way to prove it, because the Ravens have said (and not said) all the right things about Tucker’s off-field situation. All that said, DeCosta’s statement seemed to be a little bit over the top. As noted by Brandon Kleen of AwfulAnnouncing.com, multiple members of the sports media have questioned the tone and content of the team’s announcement. The Ravens likely would prefer to be dragged until the next bright, shiny object distracts the media (i.e., tomorrow morning at the latest) than risk inviting an argument that they were influenced by Tucker’s off-field situation. Still, here’s what we (or at least I) think the Ravens would have said, if they were being candid and direct: “Justin has been a great kicker. Last year, he wasn’t as great as he’d been. We were willing to give him a chance to get back on track. But the off-field allegations became just too much. If it had been one or two people, we’d be willing to let it play out. But 16? It’s hard to think they all are lying, and he’s currently not good enough to justify circling the wagons until it plays out.” Obviously, they didn’t say it that way. And they’ll take some P.R. heat for it. Still, it will be very difficult for Tucker to do anything about it. And that likely has been the plan from the moment the Ravens realized they couldn’t and wouldn’t bring him back for 2025.

Ravens will designate Justin Tucker as a post-June 1 cut,The Ravens announced Monday they are releasing kicker Justin Tucker. NBC SPORTS,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/ravens-will-designate-justin-tucker-as-a-post-june-1-cut?cid=nbcnews,"The Ravens announced Monday they are releasing kicker Justin Tucker. Jeff Zrebiec of TheAthletic.com reports the team will designate Tucker as a post-June 1 release. The move will allow the Ravens to spread out Tucker’s $7.5 million in dead cap money — the biggest dead cap hit in NFL history for a kicker — over two years. Tucker’s $4.2 million salary in 2025 was not guaranteed, so the Ravens will gain $4.2 million in cap space for 2025. Tucker signed a four-year, $22 million contract extension in August 2022, making him the league’s highest-paid kicker at the time. He had three years remaining on the deal. The Ravens drafted kicker Tyler Loop in the sixth round nine days ago, signaling the end to Tucker’s career in Baltimore. Tucker, 35, is subject of an NFL investigation into allegations by 16 massage therapists of inappropriate sexual behavior. Tucker has denied the allegations.

Ravens release Justin Tucker,"The move comes with Tucker under NFL investigation for misconduct, but the Ravens call it a football decision. NBC SPORTS",https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/ravens-release-justin-tucker?cid=nbcnews,"Kicker Justin Tucker is no longer a member of the Ravens. Ravens General Manager Eric DeCosta announced Tucker’s release via a statement on Monday afternoon. The move comes a day after Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said that an NFL investigation into misconduct allegations against Tucker was still in progress and that any decisions the team made about Tucker remaining on the roster would be football decisions related to drafting Tyler Loop in the sixth round. DeCosta used the same language in his statement. “Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,” DeCosta said. “Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker. Justin created many significant and unforgettable moments in Ravens history. His reliability, focus, drive, resilience and extraordinary talent made him one of the league’s best kickers for over a decade. We are grateful for Justin’s many contributions while playing for the Ravens. We sincerely wish him and his family the very best in this next chapter of their lives.” Tucker joined the Ravens in 2012 and has been named a first-team All-Pro six times during a run that leaves him with the highest field goal percentage in NFL history. He was less effective in 2024 and adding those results to the ongoing investigation led to Monday’s decision in Baltimore.

Curry will have an MRI on Wednesday. His status is day to day, but coach Steve Kerr acknowledged it’s unlikely he’ll be available to play in Game 2 on Thursday. “He’s obviously crushed, but the guys picked him up and played a great game,” Kerr said. “Obviously we’re all concerned about Steph, but that’s part of the game. Guys get hurt, and you move on. Our guys did a great job of moving on and getting a great win 48 hours after a Game 7 road win. It’s an amazing group of guys. They compete. They’re together.” Curry started grabbing at the back of his left leg early in the second quarter shortly after hitting a 26-foot step-back 3-pointer. He powered through some discomfort for a bit, and after getting a 14-foot floater to fall for a 27-20 lead he started motioning to the bench that he needed to come out. Once a timeout by the Timberwolves finally stopped the clock, Curry jogged gingerly to the locker room with 13 points in 13 minutes on 5-for-9 shooting. “A little deflating, but we knew he did a great job of helping us build a comfortable lead,” teammate Draymond Green said. The 37-year-old Curry helped Golden State beat Houston in Game 7 of their first-round series two nights earlier. Going the distance after taking a 3-1 lead in that series cost Curry and the Warriors some valuable rest time, and there’s only one day off between games for the first five games. There are three off days between Game 5 on May 14 and Game 6 on May 18. After a five-year period during which he had a hard time staying healthy, with a variety of injuries to both hands and feet, Curry played in 70 games this season after logging 74 games last season. The four-time NBA champion and 11-time All-Star averaged 24 points per game against the Rockets for the sixth-seeded Warriors. The spirits were high for the Warriors in the aftermath of their all-hands-on-deck dismantling of the Wolves, despite the ominous departure of their most important player. “We have the best coaching staff in the NBA. We know they’ll put us in a good spot,” said Jimmy Butler, who finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. “We all want ‘30’ back. Until then, we can all hold down the fort.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"

In three straight playoff games, the Indiana Pacers guard has delivered when it has mattered most. Haliburton made a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds remaining as the Pacers scored the final eight points in 47.9 seconds to stun the short-handed and top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers 120-119 on Tuesday night to take a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinals series. Haliburton scored 11 of his 19 points in the final 12 minutes. After Andrew Nembhard stole an inbounds pass by Cleveland’s Max Strus with 27.5 seconds remaining, Indiana tried to find a potential tying 3-pointer before Haliburton drove inside and got fouled. He made the first free throw, but missed the second. Haliburton got the offensive rebound and dribbled out to the 3-point line, where he made it from the top of the key. “I was (ticked) I missed the layup because I couldn’t hang onto the ball, so I backed it out. I just saw Ty Jerome, top of the key and knocked it down,” Haliburton said. “It’s the NBA, crazier things have happened. That’s just what basketball is. We don’t give up and we’re battle tested. We just find a way.” After making a layup with 1.3 seconds remaining in overtime to help the Pacers eliminate the Milwaukee Bucks, Haliburton has continued to hit key shots against the Cavaliers. He scored 22 points in Sunday’s 121-112 victory in the series opener, including a go-ahead 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter. “Obviously, we got lucky. Ty hit another amazing shot to win the game,” Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. “You don’t see this very often, let alone twice in one week. Tyrese, he came through again. We’re very fortunate.” Myles Turner and Aaron Nesmith led No. 4 seed Indiana with 23 points apiece. It’s the first time the Pacers have won the first two games of a playoff series on the road since a 1994 first-round set against Orlando. Game 3 is Friday night in Indianapolis. Donovan Mitchell scored 48 points for Cleveland, who were missing three key players, including two starters. NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley (left ankle) and key reserve De’Andre Hunter (right thumb) were injured in Game 1, while Darius Garland (left big toe) missed his fourth straight postseason game. “I feel like we outplayed them for the majority of the game and then towards the end we had our mental lapses. They capitalized on every single mistake that we made,” said Jarrett Allen, who had 22 points and 12 rebounds. Mitchell scored 15 points in the third quarter as the Cavaliers built a 98-81 lead late in the period. But the Pacers rallied with a 17-6 run to get back in it. Cleveland looked as though it got some breathing room with 1:06 remaining when Max Strus hit a 3-pointer off an assist by Mitchell to put them up 117-110. But the Cavs couldn’t hold on again as they committed two turnovers and the Pacers had a pair of offensive rebounds that led to points in the final minute. It’s the first time Cleveland dropped its first two at home in the playoffs since 1996 in the first round against the Knicks. “It’s hard to put all this in words,” Carlisle said. “Cleveland hit us with a hellacious punch early in the game. In the fourth, we just hung on. We maintained enough energy to get it done. Give the guys credit, they somehow found a way.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba"
Jaccob Slavin scores in OT as the Hurricanes beat the Capitals in Game 1 of their 2nd-round series,Jaccob Slavin scores in OT as the Hurricanes beat the Capitals in Game 1 of their 2nd-round series,https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-capitals-score-nhl-playoffs-cf3a91e770ad093adec0deb215ab3476,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Very few people in the arena knew the puck was in the net, including Jaccob Slavin, who shot it through traffic. Goaltender Logan Thompson figured it out when he saw the red light on behind him. “I didn’t know it went in until I saw Jordan Staal, Staalsy, coming with his arms up yelling at me,” Slavin said. Seeing it to believe it, Slavin’s overtime goal gave the Carolina Hurricanes a 2-1 victory at the Washington Capitals in Game 1 of their second-round series on Tuesday night. The winner came on their 94th attempt and 33rd that got on net, showing the shot volume offense that has gotten them to this point. “We were all over it, and we knew we had to just throw everything at the net,” Slavin said. “That mentality paid off there at the end.” Carolina allowed Washington to get just 14 shots on goal, the second-fewest in Hartford Whalers/Hurricanes history. Frederik Andersen gave up just an early second-period goal to Aliaksei Protas in his return from missing the end of the first round because of injury. “Just trying to take what comes my way and be in that moment all the time and just stay with it,” Andersen said. “You don’t know when that next big save’s going to happen.” Thompson made 31 of them for the Capitals, who spent large swaths of time defending in their own end. That sucked a lot of the energy out of the top seed in the Eastern Conference, which is accustomed to putting on the pressure rather than absorbing it. “We didn’t play our style of hockey,” Washington’s Dylan Strome said. “We let them dictate.” The Capitals led from Protas’ goal until nearly the midway point of the third, when an errant pass from Protas banked off teammate Alex Alexeyev’s right skate and to Jesperi Kotkaniemi, who fed Logan Stankoven to tie it. “I just thought I’d rip it,” Stankoven said. “It was nice to see it go in.” Carolina remains the only team perfect on the penalty kill this postseason, keeping Washington’s power play off the board twice to improve to 17 of 17. That, along with Kotkaniemi and Stankoven taking advantage of a mistake and Slavin scoring with Seth Jarvis screening Thompson was the difference. “We got some traffic,” coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “Obviously, it wasn’t the greatest of goals, but they all count.” Game 2 is Thursday night in Washington before the series shifts to Raleigh, North Carolina, for 3 and 4. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl"

They rallied from a 2-0 series deficit to oust Los Angeles in six games in the first round. Then they opened the second round Tuesday night by setting a league record with their fifth consecutive playoff comeback victory in a single postseason. Zach Hyman scored from just above the right circle with 3:02 left to put Edmonton ahead for good in its 4-2 victory over Vegas Golden Knights after falling behind 2-0. “That’s part of having a mature, older group,” Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. “Players have seen a lot, a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. In the playoffs, things fluctuate. There’s a lot of things that can stress out the team. No matter what happens, I think we handled it really well tonight.” Vegas, which had just seven shots on goal over the final two periods, lost a playoff game in regulation after leading by at least two goals for the first time. The Golden Knights are 47-4 overall in the postseason with that kind of lead. Game 2 is Thursday night in Las Vegas. “We’ll go over it and get ready for Thursday night’s game,” said Mark Stone, who scored both Vegas goals. “It’s going to be a big one for us.” Leon Draisaitl had a goal and an assist for the Oilers, and Corey Perry and Connor Brown scored the other goals. Evan Bouchard and Connor McDavid each had two assists. McDavid now has four consecutive postseasons with at least 10 assists for fourth-best in league history. Calvin Pickard was barely tested after the first period and finished with 15 shots. “We have experience to win games in a lot of different ways, a lot of untraditional ways,” Hyman said. “Any time you get a win, it’s a big day. We’ve got to take what we did in the second and third and do in the first.” Stone tied Jonathan Marchessault’s franchise record with 36 goals for his Vegas career. He also extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. Adin Hill made 24 saves. Both star-studded top lines delivered in the first period, with Stone scoring twice, the first on a double-minor power play. Edmonton’s top unit cut the deficit in half with 3:34 left when Perry deked Hill for an open net with McDavid and Draisaitl getting assists on the play. Neither team scored in the second period even though the Oilers outshot Vegas 12-1. The Golden Knights had never been held to fewer than two shots on goal in a regulation playoff period. Edmonton didn’t waste a chance early in the third, tying the score 57 seconds in when Draisaitl backhanded a shot off the boards and off Hill. Hyman, who earlier in the shift took a stick to the face from Kaedan Korczak, broke the tie in the closing minutes, and Brown sealed the win 1:16 later. Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo did not play because of an illness, allowing Korczak to make his first career postseason start. Vegas also was without Pavel Dorofeyev, who led the team with 35 goals this season, for the second game in a row because of an undisclosed injury. Coach Bruce Cassidy has descibed him as day to day. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl"

Mott on Sunday morning had foreshadowed skipping the Preakness in the name of long-term interests. “We want to do what’s best for the horse,” he told reporters at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. “Of course, you always think about a Triple Crown, and that’s not something we’re not going to think about.” Sovereignty won a muddy Derby with jockey Junior Alvarado at odds of 7-1 by passing favorite Journalism down the stretch. Owner Godolphin’s U.S. director of bloodstock, Michael Banahan, deferred an explanation to Mott in a text message sent to The Associated Press, calling it a team decision that “both feel it’s the right direction for the horse going forward.” A message left for Mott was not immediately returned. This is the fifth time since Justify won all three races in 2018 that the Preakness will go on without a true shot at a Triple Crown. Elevated winner Country House and Maximum Security, who was disqualified for interference, each did not participate in 2019, the races were run out of order in 2020, Bob Baffert-trained Medina Spirit was DQ’d for a positive drug test in 2021 and long shot Rich Strike was held out in 2022 to rest him for the previously planned five weeks. Mage finished third in the Preakness in 2023, and Mystik Dan was second last year after his owner and trainer also were initially reluctant to run him. The two-week turnaround from the Kentucky Derby to the Preakness and changes in modern racing have sparked debate around the sport about spacing out the races. Prominent owner Mike Repole earlier Tuesday posted on social media a proposal to move the Belmont to second in the Triple Crown order, four weeks after the Kentucky Derby and sliding the Preakness back further with the aim of keeping more of the top horses involved. “The Preakness being run two weeks after the Kentucky Derby, in this new day and age in racing, shows the lack of vision and leadership needed to evolve this sport,” Repole wrote. “I expect the top three finishers of this year’s Derby to skip the Preakness and go right to the Belmont.” No decision has been made on second-place finisher Journalism, who was the Derby favorite, or third-place Baeza for the 150th running of the Preakness, the last at Pimlico Race Course before it is knocked down and rebuilt. The plan is for the 2026 Preakness to take place at Laurel Park between Baltimore and Washington while Pimlico is under construction. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing"

Home-court advantage? It doesn’t exist so far in the NBA conference semifinals — where visiting teams combined to go 4-0 in Game 1s, the first time that has happened during this round in the league’s playoff history. Indiana beat top-seeded Cleveland on Sunday in the opener of that East series, New York beat defending champion Boston and Denver beat West top-seeded Oklahoma City in their respective openers Monday, and Golden State topped Minnesota in Game 1 of their matchup Tuesday. “It’s an amazing group of guys,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Golden State’s win, one that came with Stephen Curry out for much of the game with a strained hamstring. So far in these playoffs, road teams have gone 23-25. That’s on pace to be the third-best overall road playoff record in NBA postseason history, not counting the bubble season of 2020 when nobody technically was at home. Road teams had gone 3-1 in the Round 2 openers of the NBA playoffs on three other occasions — 2023, 2015 and 2011 — in the current playoff format, which dates to 1984. (It also happened inside the bubble during the 2020 playoffs, when teams had home and road designations, but games were on neutral floors inside Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.) But 4-0 has never happened, until now. “I always say a playoff series doesn’t start until someone wins a road game,” Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton said. “Well, we’ve won two.” That’s true: Indiana doubled down on its road success by also taking Game 2 at Cleveland on Tuesday night, just before Golden State lost Stephen Curry early but won Game 1 at Minnesota. And all that led to even more road history: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday became the first three-day stretch in NBA playoff history where visiting teams combined to go at least 6-0. That run started Sunday with Indiana’s Game 1 win at Cleveland, then Golden State’s Game 7 road win at Houston in the conclusion of the first round of the playoffs. The wins by New York and Denver were Monday, then Indiana and Golden State won again on Tuesday. “This team has fought all year,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “It’s been a pretty good road team.” They’re not alone. Not this year, anyway, and this trend didn’t start in these playoffs. Home teams won 54% of games in the regular season, the fourth time the leaguewide home winning percentage has dipped that low in the last five years. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"

And there have been some heroic moments, too",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-last-second-winners-e18742ea59aa43ff4da71b2478006e95,"Aaron Gordon went to the postgame interview room after his latest heroic moment for the Denver Nuggets, took a seat with his two nephews on his lap and waited for somebody to say something. He finally broke the silence. “Any questions?” he asked. Seems about right that he would ask that, given that so far in these NBA playoffs Gordon has been one of the players with all the answers in the biggest moments — when games are on the line. He is one of the contenders for the unofficial title of Mr. Game Winner of these playoffs, his case built around a no-time-left dunk — believed to be the first of its kind in postseason history — to beat the Los Angeles Clippers in Round 1, then a 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds left to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night. “Did I know it was in? I knew it wasn’t a miss,” Gordon said of his latest game winner. And Gordon isn’t alone in being part of these down-to-the-wire moments. Tyrese Haliburton — another Mr. Game Winner candidate — now has two such shots as well in these playoffs, the latest coming in the form of a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to beat top-seeded Cleveland 120-119 on Tuesday night for a 2-0 Pacers lead in that series. That one came after he had a layup with 1.4 seconds left in overtime of the Pacers’ series-clinching, frantic Game 5 rally in the final moments to oust Milwaukee. “Obviously, had to get lucky,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said Tuesday night after Haliburton’s latest heroics led his team’s second successful comeback from seven points down and less than a minute left in a three-game span. “Tyrese hit another amazing shot to win the game. You don’t see this very often, let alone twice in one week. We’re very fortunate.” He’s right. You don’t see this very often. There are five players — Robert Horry in 2002, LeBron James in 2006 and 2018, Jamal Murray last year, and now Gordon and Haliburton this year — who have hit two go-ahead shots in the final 10 seconds of wins in the same postseason. That’s it. That’s the whole list. “This is what I do,” Haliburton said in the on-court interview afterward, still out of breath. Round 2 is just getting underway in these NBA playoffs and already there have been 15 games decided by three points or fewer, matching or exceeding the total from each of the last 10 playoff years. The New York Knicks have won five games so far in the playoffs, four of them by three points or fewer. “We’re just going to keep fighting,” the Knicks’ Mikal Bridges said after the Game 1 win at Boston on Monday night. “That’s who we are ... and we keep showing it.” This is not normal: So far, 30% of games in this year’s playoffs going into Tuesday have been decided by three points or fewer. It’s happening about twice as often as it did last season and about three times as often as it did in other postseason runs over the last decade. Of those 15 games so far decided by three points or fewer, five of them have had a go-ahead basket in the final 10 seconds. There’s the two by Haliburton, the two by Gordon, and the other was New York’s Jalen Brunson hitting a 3-pointer to beat Detroit in Round 1. Brunson was the NBA’s top clutch player this season. Haliburton is an Olympic champion. Gordon was part of Denver’s run to the NBA title two years ago. In the biggest moments, they know what is required. “It’s not about putting the team on my back,” Brunson said. “I have confidence in them. They have confidence in me. We’re going to compete. We’re going to find the best way to attack each possession. It may look like I get the credit ... but it’s not just me.” Brunson had a chance to win Game 1 at Boston with a last-second floater in regulation — “not clutch enough,” he mused when asked about it after the Knicks finished off the overtime win — but the Knicks found a way anyway. New York was down by 20 in that game and won; Boston was 40-1 this season in games when it had a lead of 20 or more. Denver was down by 14 at Oklahoma City and won; the Thunder are 64-2 this season in games in which they led by at least 12 points against anybody besides the Nuggets, but they’re only 2-3 in such games against Denver. The Nuggets now have three wins by three points or fewer so far in these playoffs. “We make stupid mistakes,” Denver star Nikola Jokic, who had a historic 42-point, 22-rebound effort, told Altitude TV after the Game 1 win. “But we find a way.” At this time of year, finding a way is the only thing that’s required. Haliburton, Gordon and Brunson have proven that. ___ On Basketball analyzes the biggest topics in the NBA. More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba"
"Sliding mitts are baseball’s ‘must-have,’ even if at youth levels, they’re all fashion, no function","Sliding mitts are baseball’s ‘must-have,’ even if at youth levels, they’re all fashion, no function",https://apnews.com/article/sliding-mitts-little-league-566b12315127f05ac75571e8a5d4d062,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Andrew McCutchen hasn’t had the conversation with 7-year-old son Steel yet, but the Pittsburgh Pirates star knows it’s probably coming at some point. Steel, already playing in a youth baseball league, will probably come home at one point and ask his five-time All-Star father if he can have whatever hot item his teammates might be wearing during a given spring. McCutchen plans to accommodate Steel up to a point. The oldest of McCutchen’s four children is already rocking an arm sleeve, just the way dad does. Yet if Steel is hoping his father will spring for a sliding mitt — a padded glove a player can slip over one of their hands to protect it should the hand get stepped on while diving headfirst for a base — he probably shouldn’t get his hopes up. McCutchen, who has stolen 220 bases at the major league level, has never worn one. And he’s quick to point out the next time the cleat of a fielder mashes his hand will also be the first. Still, the 38-year-old understands. Once upon a time, he was a 20-something who epitomized baseball cool, from his dreadlocks (long since shorn) to his goatee to his rope chain to the occasional skull cap he wore underneath his batting helmet, all of it designed to accentuate McCutchen’s innate blend of talent and charisma. “It’s all about the drip,” McCutchen said with a smile. Even if the “drip” (Gen Z slang for stylish clothes and their accessories) emphasizes fashion over function, particularly when it comes to the gloves — which look a bit like oven mitts — that are becoming just as ubiquitous in the Little Leagues as they are in the major leagues. Former major leaguer Scott Podsednik (career stolen base total: 309) is credited with “inventing” the sliding mitt during the late stages of his 11-year career. Tired of having his hand stepped on, Podsednik worked with a hand therapist for a solution. The initial mitts were relatively simple. A 2009 picture of Podsednik sliding into second base shows his left hand covered in what looks like a padded modified batting glove, all wrapped in black to match the trim on his Chicago White Sox uniform. Chicago White Sox’s Scott Podsednik steals second base during a baseball game against the Cleveland Indians, June 29, 2009, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Mark Duncan, File) Things have gotten considerably more intricate over the years. Google “sliding mitt designs” and you’ll find themes ranging from the American flag to an ice cream cone to aliens to a poop emoji ( yes, really ). Scott McMillen, a lawyer in the Chicago area, had no plans to get into the baseball accessory business. He first took notice of sliding mitts when his son Braydon, then 10, pointed out one of his teammates had one and said basically, “Oh hey dad, wouldn’t it be nice if I had one, too.” They headed to a local sporting goods store, where McMillen was surprised at the variety available. That was around 2021. By early 2024, McMillen had launched “ Goat’d,” a specialty baseball accessory company with everything from sliding mitts to batting gloves to arm sleeves to headbands and more, many of them religiously inspired. Sales during their first full year? Over 1 million units. “We were surprised at how large the marketplace is,” McMillen said. Maybe he shouldn’t have been. Youth sports have bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Aspen Institute’s 2024 State of Play report noted that the participation levels in sports among children ages 6-17 were the highest they’ve been since 2015. Baseball’s numbers have steadied following a decline. Little League International told The Associated Press last fall that more than 2 million kids played baseball or softball under its umbrella across the world, an uptick over 2019. Many of those kids are also fans of the game, some of whom may have noticed their favorite major leaguer sporting a mitt when they’re on the bases. Yes, that was San Diego Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. sliding across home plate ( feetfirst, by the way ) with a bright yellow mitt on his left hand in the ninth inning of a 2-1 win over Pittsburgh last weekend. It’s one of the many ways in which the game has evolved over the years. When McMillen grew up, there wasn’t much swag to go around. “We had our baseball uniform and our glove (and) everyone looked the same, everyone was the same,” he said. “Now, everyone wants to express themselves individually. The best way to do that without acting like a clown is to wear something that shows people who you are.” Self-expression, however, doesn’t exactly come cheap, particularly in an era when top-of-the-line bats are $400 or more. What amounts to an entry-level sliding mitt can go for $40, but Goat’d and others have versions that can fetch double that. That hasn’t stopped sales from being brisk, and McMillen points out it’s not merely a luxury item. “We don’t play football with 1940s safety equipment,” he said. “You feel better in the (batter’s) box when you have something that protects you, right? With a sliding mitt, it’s also like, ‘Hey this is fun. It’s cool. I want to be like my fave high school player, like my favorite college player.’” It’s becoming increasingly common for McMillen and other members of the company’s staff to spot Goat’d gear at the field. In recent months, they’ve popped up in youth tournaments from Georgia to Las Vegas, sometimes in the back pockets of players as young as 6 or 7. McMillen can’t help but shake his head to see his product become part of the time-honored tradition of kids imitating their heroes. Which is good for business and, oh by the way, probably unnecessary. Here’s the thing: In most — if not all — youth baseball leagues, headfirst slides that would require a player to stretch out their hand to secure the bag are illegal. In Little League, for example, stealing bases for players 12 and under is rare because the player can take off only after the ball has reached the batter. And even if they do bolt for the next base, they have to slide feetfirst. The only times in Little League that a baserunner can dive headfirst toward a base is when they are returning to it while in a rundown or during a pickoff attempt, both of which are also rare. That doesn’t stop the players from wanting a sliding mitt. It also doesn’t stop their parents from buying them, all part of the pressure to “keep up with the Jones” that has practically been a part of youth sports culture since the first time somebody came to practice with a batting glove or wristbands. It’s a phenomenon Chelsea Cahill and her family has known for years. The longtime educator who lives just east of Columbus, Ohio, has spent most of the last decade shuttling her three boys from practice to games to tournaments. What she and her husband have learned over the years is that some trends come and go, but the pressure to have the right stuff remains. “There’s always that feeling of ‘This is the next new thing’ or ‘This is what you’ve got to get,’” Cahill said. They appeased their sons up to a point, but only up to a point. Last summer their youngest son Braxton, then 11, and the rest of the kids on his travel team kept pestering their parents to buy sliding mitts. Entering the final tournament, the team moms decided to give in. Sort of. Rather than plop down that kind of money for something they didn’t actually need, the moms headed to a local dollar store and bought them actual oven mitts — the kind used to pull tonight’s dinner from out of the oven. Average retail price? Less than a cup of coffee at the gas station. Oh, and the kids loved them, and wore them during the game. Cahill posted video of them playing with the mitts stuck in their back pocket to her TikTok account. The video is now at 12 million views and counting. “They thought it was hilarious, but we didn’t really think they would wear them for the rest of the tournament,” Cahill said. “We were wrong. They really embraced it!” Among viewers of that TikTok, by the way, were the people at Goat’d, who sent Braxton a couple of mitts as a result. The good news is, Cahill now won’t have to buy one for Braxton this spring. Yet there’s also something else she has learned through the years: This time in her boys’ lives is fleeting. For proof, just look at her calendar. Her two older sons — the ones who played travel baseball just like Braxton, and asked for all the cool stuff their teammates had, just like Braxton has — gave up baseball by the time they got to high school. Her advice to parents who might be feeling the financial pinch of what it takes to play these days: Relax. “We’ve learned as parents is to stop taking it so seriously,” she said. “They’re kids. Let them have fun.” A day after hundreds of members of the Monroeville Baseball and Softball Association marched through the Pittsburgh suburb’s well-appointed community park, the regular season is in full swing. All four fields are alive with the chatter of coaches, parents and boys and girls aged anywhere from 5-12. Over on Field 1, the Rays are in the middle of their season opener. Playing first base, Josiah Jones has his glove at the ready, with a black sliding mitt noticeably sticking out of his left back pocket. Per the league rules, the Rays and the other players at the “Bronco” level (ages 11-12), play actual full-on baseball. They can take leads and steal bases whenever they like, though headfirst slides are only allowed when returning to a base, just like in Little League. Longtime MBSA executive commissioner Josh Plassmeyer is milling about, trying to keep tabs on everything. Plassmeyer outlawed sliding mitts on his son Grant’s 10-and-under tournament team, calling them a “distraction” because players would spend so much time fiddling with them once they got to first base, they would miss signs from the third-base coach. About 50 feet away, Jones settles into the box and rips a ball to left-center field. His long legs carry him past first base, and he cruises into second with an easy double. As his teammates erupted in the dugout, Jones beamed for a brief moment. Then, as the opposing pitcher stepped onto the rubber, he took an aggressive lead off second and eyed third. His back pocket, the one where his sliding mitt had been 30 minutes before, was empty. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"

Mayor Muriel Bowser drew a laugh from the room when she was asked how it feels to manage a mercurial relationship with the White House and Congress — while, by the way, also trying to run a city of 700,000 people. “It is just like you might imagine,” she deadpanned. “It’s tricky.” A few hours after that comment Monday, Bowser’s balancing act with President Donald Trump was on public display. She appeared with Trump to celebrate Washington being named as host for the 2027 NFL draft and maintained a poker face while Trump talked at length about immigration. Bowser also continues to lobby the House of Representatives to pass a simple fix that would prevent the nation’s capital from having to immediately cut $400 million from its 2025 budget in the middle of the budget year. The House essentially created the shortfall earlier this year when it eliminated a little-known provision in a budget resolution. The change would force the District of Columbia to immediately revert to its 2024 budget parameters. And while the Senate immediately passed a simple fix, the House has failed to bring that measure up for a vote during four weeks in session — despite it being publicly endorsed by Trump. Bowser has warned that layoffs, furloughs and service cuts could be coming — and within days — if the issue isn’t resolved. Now Bowser’s relationship with the D.C. Council is coming under public stress. The third-term mayor faces a looming showdown with the council over a host of budget issues and her new deal to bring the NFL’s Washington Commanders back to the nation’s capital. Citing the uncertainty surrounding the 2025 budget, Bowser has delayed submitting a proposed 2026 budget to the council by more than a month. But D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has publicly complained that Bowser is dragging out the process. “We can’t wait longer to start making the service reductions and cuts,” Mendelson said Monday of the 2025 budget cuts. “She has to move forward now.” Bowser maintains she is following the proper timeline and protocol required by the city’s chief financial officer. But Mendelson contends that Bowser was using the delay to “jam the council” and force it into a pressurized deadline where city legislators wouldn’t have time to properly question either the budget or the particulars of the Commanders agreement. That stadium deal should prompt a robust debate when it comes up for D.C. Council approval. When it was first announced, Mendelson said he didn’t think it had enough votes to pass. But different members of the 12-person body have staked out widely varied initial positions. First-term Ward 5 Councilmember Zachary Parker called the chance to bring football back to the nation’s capital and revitalize the site of the old RFK Stadium “a once in a generation opportunity.” Parker said he believed the deal would and should pass; he simply wants to make sure the city gets the best deal possible. But veteran Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen has taken a harder public line. He says he opposes the entire concept of a stadium — especially if any significant amount of public money is spent on the project. “I don’t think a stadium returns back the economic investment. Every study under the sun shows that,” Allen said last week at a public meeting to rally opposition to the stadium deal. “You can love football and love the Commanders and still think this is a bad deal for the city.”"
The stars are still aligned in golf as the PGA Championship nears,The stars are still aligned in golf as the PGA Championship nears,https://apnews.com/article/scheffler-dechambeau-mcilroy-spieth-pga-championship-118eb4085a99cac2a927b8e938aab7a0,"A different month, a different major and the stars are still aligned. Bryson DeChambeau finally cashed in on a Sunday, losing a five-shot lead before pulling ahead on the final three holes to win in South Korea. This was three weeks after Rory McIlroy picked up a Masters green jacket and the career Grand Slam. It was about 13 hours before Scottie Scheffler destroyed the field in Dallas. And as somewhat of a footnote, Jordan Spieth shot a 62 on the final day in Dallas that only stoked conversation about the chances of another career Grand Slam. The PGA Championship starts in nine days. “Scottie is on a great run. Joaquin Niemann is on a great run. Jon Rahm has been playing well,” DeChambeau said after his victory at LIV Golf Korea. “There’s a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that’s going to be in the PGA Championship. We’re going to be battling it out.” Most peculiar was how DeChambeau included Niemann — three wins in LIV Golf this year, but still without a top-10 finish in his 23 starts in the majors — and left out McIlroy, whose three wins this year have come at Pebble Beach, The Players Championship and the Masters. DeChambeau played with McIlroy in the final round at Augusta National, where he took the lead after two holes before fading to a 75 to finish four shots behind. He later said when asked about the dynamic in their pairing that McIlroy “wouldn’t talk to me.” Rahm has yet to finish out of the top 10 at LIV Golf, but he has gone quiet in the majors since joining the Saudi-funded league. He’s still Jon Rahm, however. It all sets up for high intrigue going into the second major of the year. That hasn’t always been the case for the PGA Championship whether it was held in May or August. The Masters is forever linked with Augusta National and decades of high drama. The U.S. Open bills itself as the toughest test in golf, sometimes to a fault. The British Open is played on a links course. And how is the PGA Championship best defined? “The other one,” Geoff Ogilvy once said. The Masters, of course, will be hard to top the way it played out. McIlroy, with his best chance at the career slam, fell behind, built a big lead, shockingly lost his big lead, rallied with two magnificent shots and eventually won a playoff over Justin Rose. McIlroy is still buzzing over finally winning the green jacket, which he wore during appearances last week on NBC’s “Today” and “The Tonight Show,” the latter with host Jimmy Fallon in which McIlroy replicated chipping into a washing machine from when he was a wee lad in Northern Ireland. The career Grand Slam is in the books. Is the calendar Grand Slam in play? Only four players since the modern slam came to life in 1960 — Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Spieth — have even won the first two legs. The PGA Championship is at Quail Hollow, where McIlroy already has won four times. But he is no longer the betting favorite one week out. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler as a slight favorite after a brand of golf from the No. 1 player not seen since last year. Scheffler missed two months recovering from minor surgery after he punctured his right hand while making ravioli. Something had been missing in his game since his return. But it was all there in Dallas, and it was frightening for those who had to face it. Scheffler was poised to break the PGA Tour scoring record of 72 holes until a chip rolled back to his feet on the 17th (bogey) and he failed to birdie the 18th (his first time all week not making birdie or better on a par 5). He still tied the mark at 253 and won by eight. “I feel like my game is trending in a good direction,” Scheffler said. “I’m excited to start the rest of the season.” It’s May and he’s talking about a starting point. Three majors are still to come, and the PGA Championship could be a great indicator where this is headed. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler at +400, with McIlroy at +500. That could change after this week because McIlroy is playing at Philadelphia Cricket Club and Scheffler is not. DeChambeau was listed at +1200 and always worth noticing. He had a burden lifted in South Korea, not just because it was his first win since the U.S. Open last year, but because it was his fourth straight time in the final group (in LIV Golf with its shotgun start, that means starting on the first hole). His scoring average the previous three times was 73.7. And then he shot 30 on the back nine in South Korea and won by two. Next stop: the PGA Championship, where last year in Kentucky DeChambeau was every bit the entertainer and lost to Xander Schauffele’s birdie putt on the final hole. As for Spieth, he’s still hard to predict as he returns from wrist surgery last August. But a 62 in the final round suggests his game isn’t too far off. The only scars from Dallas might be spending the first two days with Scheffler. Spieth opened with rounds of 67-69 and was 12 shots behind. “It wasn’t that long ago I was definitely better than him, and now I’m definitely not right now,” Spieth said. “I hate admitting that about anybody, but I just watched it those first two rounds, and I’ve got to get better. It’s very inspiring.” Gary Player (1965) and Nicklaus (1966) completed the career Grand Slam one year apart. Is it possible for that to happen one month apart? As is often said about the Masters, the PGA Championship can’t start soon enough. ___ On The Fringe analyzes the biggest topics in golf during the season. AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf ___"
Mitchell and shorthanded Cavaliers don’t have enough at the end and go down 2-0 in series to Pacers,Mitchell and shorthanded Cavaliers don’t have enough at the end and go down 2-0 in series to Pacers,https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-cavaliers-pacers-f7f0f008ad0680a8ca055ab399a54deb,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell did everything he physically could to try to get the Cleveland Cavaliers back on equal footing in their Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Indiana Pacers. It wasn’t enough, though. Now, the Cavaliers face their most daunting task of the season — down two games, having to go on the road and being shorthanded. “We’ve got to go get two in Indy. Simple as that,” Mitchell said after scoring 48 points in Cleveland’s 120-119 loss to Indiana on Tuesday night. The top-seeded Cavaliers entered the game without three key players, including two starters. NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley (left ankle) was injured in Game 1, while Darius Garland (left big toe) missed his fourth straight postseason game. De’Andre Hunter (right thumb) was also injured Sunday night. TNT reported during the game that Mitchell was also hampered by a calf strain, but that was not listed on the NBA’s injury report. He also started cramping late in the game as Indiana rallied from a 119-112 deficit with eight straight points in the final 47.9 seconds. “I’m banged up, we all are. It’s tough, but that’s what the playoffs are,” said Mitchell, who had the second-most points in a playoff game at Cleveland’s Rocket Arena. Mitchell played 36 minutes, went 15 of 30 from the field and tied a playoff career high with 17 made free throws. He also had nine assists that resulted in 24 Cleveland points. Six of the assists came on 3-pointers, including one to Max Strus to give the Cavs a 117-110 advantage with 1:06 remaining. Cleveland did not have enough at the end. Mitchell committed an offensive foul with 45.9 seconds remaining, leading to Pascal Siakam’s layup to bring them within 119-116. Mitchell then couldn’t get a rebound after Tyrese Haliburton missed a free throw with the Cavs leading by two. Haliburton got the loose ball and hit a step-back 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to give the Pacers the victory. “I should have grabbed the ball. I was right there. That’s on me,” Mitchell said. “On the charge call, I tried to be strong with the ball. I knew they were going to trap. I understood it was coming, but the elbow was too high.” Cleveland led most of the game despite going with a shorter rotation of nine players. Defensively, they did a better job of dealing with Indiana’s quick pace until the end. “I thought we outplayed them, that’s the shame of this game,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “We had some poor decision-making plays at the rim, turnovers. A couple bad decisions, I felt like. So that was part of the collapse.” The Cavaliers are hoping to possibly get Mobley, Garland or Hunter back for Game 3 in Indiana on Friday night. If not, Mitchell has faith his shorthanded group can find a way to make it a series. Cleveland has rallied from a 2-0 series deficit three times previously — the 2007 Eastern Conference finals against Detroit, the 2016 NBA Finals against Golden State and 2018 Eastern Conference finals against Boston. “We’ve shown how deep we are as a team, how great we are as a unit. It’s tough losing like that, but we got to find a way,” Mitchell said. “We can sit here and dwell on this and be home in about four or five days, or we can move on and take some things that we did really well and go from there. “We’ve got to go out there and take care of business. Otherwise, that’s it.” Jarrett Allen — who had 22 points and 12 rebounds — said Mitchell’s performance made him realize he has to try harder as well. “You can’t let one guy, especially your leader, go into something alone like that and give it his all,” Allen said. “It pushes everybody on the bench to try their hardest and try to replicate that.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba"

The Warriors sure made the best of a bad situation. Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and Jimmy Butler gave the Warriors a vintage all-around performance in an inspired 99-88 victory over the stumbling Timberwolves that opened the second-round series on Tuesday night. “It was beautiful to see,” Green said. “Everybody who came into the game gave us something.” Hield picked up where he left off in the Game 7 win at Houston that finished the first round by scoring 24 points on 5-for-8 shooting from 3-point range. Butler had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and Green had four first-half 3s on his way to 18 points, as the Warriors used 12 players, plenty of hustle and lockdown defense to overcome the concerning departure of the franchise cornerstone Curry. “It’s about the intensity and the heart and the fight, and if you do that, you give yourself a chance,” coach Steve Kerr said. The home teams have yet to win in the second round of these NBA playoffs. Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday. The big question: Will Curry will be available? The league’s career-leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that. Kerr frequently sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off. “People are going to try to blame whatever, blame whoever,” said star Anthony Edwards, who had one point in the first half. “They can blame me. I just didn’t play good enough.” The Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter. Edwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after the rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third. “We had opportunities to run out. Our transition decision making was diabolical,” coach Chris Finch said. “Obviously we couldn’t hit a shot, but I didn’t like the fact that we couldn’t repeatedly generate good shots. We should’ve been able to.” Butler, Green and the Warriors had a big hand in that. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"
"Rookie GM Brian Gregory says he’s ready to rebuild the Suns, touts closeness with owner Mat Ishbia","Rookie GM Brian Gregory says he’s ready to rebuild the Suns, touts closeness with owner Mat Ishbia",https://apnews.com/article/suns-brian-gregory-mat-ishbia-d2c50b6f4b64910344e9099a98cd4915,"PHOENIX (AP) — Brian Gregory’s basketball resume has plenty of gravitas thanks to nearly two decades as an NCAA Division I head coach at Dayton, Georgia Tech and South Florida. That’s not why he’s the new general manager of the Phoenix Suns. Instead, it is Gregory’s 25-year relationship with Suns owner Mat Ishbia that is the major reason he’s making the rare transition from college sidelines to an NBA front office. Some may see that as a negative, but Gregory believes his closeness with Ishbia will be an asset as the Suns embark on a difficult rebuild following one of the most disappointing seasons in franchise history. “I’m never going to shy away from the fact that one of the reasons I’m sitting up here is because of my relationship with Mat Ishbia,” Gregory said Tuesday. “But that relationship is founded on our alignment. Shared values. Shared work ethic. We’ve been through a lot together. “He trusts me and I trust him.” The 58-year-old Gregory was elevated to the general manager’s role with the Suns last week, with former GM James Jones moving into the role of a senior advisor. Oronde Taliaferro was promoted to assistant general manager and Paul Rivers will add basketball operations responsibilities to his role as chief innovation officer. Gregory was an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1999 to 2003, which was the same time that Ishbia was a walk-on guard for the Spartans. Michigan State enjoyed plenty of success during those years, including a national championship in 2000. Now the Ishbia-Gregory pairing will try to recreate that magic for a franchise that has never won a title in its 57-year history despite making the Finals in 1976, 1993 and 2021. The Suns finished last season with a disappointing 36-46 record despite the league’s most expensive roster that included the All-Star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. Booker — a four-time All-Star and franchise icon who has spent all of his 10 seasons in the desert — is the only player who seems certain to return. Gregory’s first task this offseason will be hiring a new head coach to replace Mike Budenholzer, who was fired after just one season. It will be the Suns’ fourth head coach in four years. After that, it will be time to focus on an expensive but flawed roster. Ishbia said last month he wants future Suns teams to feature “some grit, some determination, some work ethic, some grind, some joy. We just haven’t had that.” Gregory’s most valuable trade chip this summer appears to be Durant, who was still one of the NBA’s elite scorers last season at 36. The 15-time All-Star averaged 26.6 points on 53% shooting, shows few signs of slowing and will certainly have multiple suitors during the offseason. Beal — a three-time All-Star — could be much more difficult to unload. The oft-injured guard is due more than $50 million next season, but his production hasn’t come close to matching the price tag. Gregory said he likes both players, but wasn’t ready to comment on their future in the desert. “I have a very good relationship with both those guys,” Gregory said. “Kevin gave me a nice hug in the weight room the other night when the news came across Twitter. Had a great dinner with Brad Beal last Thursday and we talked a little about summer plans and different things like that. “My main focus, to be honest with you, is finding the right head coach for those guys.” Gregory joined the Suns in 2023 and served in several roles, most recently as the vice president of player programming. He had major input in the Suns selecting Ryan Dunn and Oso Ighodaro in last year’s draft and both had promising moments during their rookie seasons. Dunn and Ighodaro featured on-court personalities that seem closer to Ishbia’s gritty ideals, with the young duo featuring an energy and spirit that was conspicuously lacking from much of the rest of the roster. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba"

Top-seeded Cleveland was already facing adversity after dropping Game 1 to the Pacers 121-112 on Sunday night. The Cavaliers haven’t lost their first two games at home in the playoffs since 1996 against the New York Knicks in the first round. Mobley, the league’s Defensive Player of the Year, and Hunter were both injured in a 26-second span in the fourth quarter Sunday night. Mobley sprained his left ankle when he was boxed out by Indiana’s Myles Turner and didn’t have room to land after his turnaround hook shot went in. Mobley is averaging 17 points and 7.2 rebounds in the playoffs. Hunter, averaging 23.8 minutes off the bench in the postseason, dislocated the thumb on his right shooting hand after Bennedict Mathurin blocked his running dunk attempt. Dean Wade will start in place of Mobley, while Ty Jerome gets his first postseason start after Sam Merrill got the call the last three games that Garland was out. Kenny Atkinson, voted the NBA’s Coach of the Year on Monday night, was still agitated about the non-calls where his players suffered the injuries. “Even if it’s not malice, we need to see our best players playing in the playoffs,” he said before Tuesday’s game. “This rhetoric going around, people say, ‘Oh man, that’s playoff basketball.’ To me, that’s not. As a stakeholder in this, we need to figure out what is acceptable.” Garland continues to deal with a sprained left big toe. This is the fourth straight playoff game he has missed and has only played two of Cleveland’s last eight games. Jerome leads all NBA bench players in points (17.2) and assists (5.4) per game so far this postseason. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said he understood where Atkinson was coming from because he noted protecting players is part of a coach’s job. “Nobody wants to see players here. That disturbs the hell out of us,” Carlisle said about the injuries. “When you turn in a play to the league, they let the other team know. I don’t want to tell you the number of plays we turned in from the Milwaukee series because that was five games.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba"

With the Mariners trailing by one, Jorge Polanco drew a one-out walk from reliever Tyler Ferguson (0-1) in the ninth. Rodríguez followed with a single and Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Raleigh’s single to right field gave Seattle a 4-3 lead, and Dylan Moore added a sacrifice fly. Carlos Vargas got three outs for his first major league save, retiring pinch-hitter Seth Brown with two on to end it. Collin Snider (1-0) gave up a go-ahead single to Miguel Andujar in the eighth but prevented further damage. Seattle is 17–6 since April 9, the best record in the big leagues during that span. J.P. Crawford singled in the fifth to extend the longest active hitting streak in the majors to a career-best 14 games. Rodríguez homered in the first inning and Miles Mastrobuoni had an RBI double for the Mariners in the second. Brent Rooker and Tyler Soderstrom each had three hits for the Athletics. Andujar added two hits and two RBIs. Rooker also scored twice — and stole two bases for the first time in his career. Mariners relievers Gabe Speier and Snider got bases-loaded strikeouts to end the seventh and eighth innings, respectively.

Justin Verlander was in position for his first win with the San Francisco Giants — but he walked away empty-handed. Verlander pitched five innings Tuesday night against the Chicago Cubs before giving a 5-3 lead to San Francisco’s bullpen. The three-time AL Cy Young Award winner ended up with another no-decision, but the Giants scored nine times in the 11th for a 14-5 victory. “It’s crazy, because he could easily have four or five wins at this point,” San Francisco manager Bob Melvin said. “So just another one of those where we’re a pitch away from getting him a win, and next thing you know he doesn’t, but it doesn’t mean he’s not performing well.” The 42-year-old Verlander signed a $15 million, one-year contract with the Giants in January. He was charged with two losses while going winless in his first eight starts for the longest such drought at any point during his 20 seasons in the majors. “I’m somebody who really tries to focus on the big picture,” Verlander said. “Just try to keep pitching well and giving us a chance to win and that’s doing my job, and wins can come in bunches. It’s a team sport. Not everything is in your control as a starter, and I know that.” Verlander allowed five hits, struck out three and walked two against the NL Central leaders. The big blow was Miguel Amaya’s two-run homer after San Francisco had opened a 4-0 lead in the top of the third. “Obviously, you want some wins,” Verlander said. “I’ve also been somebody who never really expects a lot of wins when I only go five innings. I don’t really feel like I did my job as well as I should have today.” During his season-opening drought, Verlander has been hurt by lackluster run support. He had a 1.96 ERA in 18 1/3 innings over his previous three starts. He was in position to get his first win against Colorado on Thursday, but the lowly Rockies rallied for a 4-3 win. Verlander went 5-6 with a 5.48 ERA in 17 starts for Houston last year. He had stints on the injured list for shoulder inflammation and neck discomfort. The nine-time All-Star became a free agent after he failed to pitch 140 innings, a total that would have triggered his ability to exercise a $35 million conditional player option. Verlander is 262-149 with a 3.31 ERA in 534 career starts. He is tops among active big league pitchers in wins, innings (3,457 2/3), strikeouts (3,451) and starts (534). “I’ve been kind of working my way towards I think being better and better,” Verlander said. “Just kind of stay the course and see what happens. We’ve still got a lot of starts left. It’s really early.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"

Zach Neto hustled home with the tying run to start a six-run rally in the eighth by the Angels, who scored more than five runs in a full game for the first time since April 10. O’Hoppe delivered an RBI single before Moncada hit his first homer since September 2023 in his first game back from a thumb injury. Jo Adell added another homer moments later. George Springer and Anthony Santander homered for the Blue Jays, who opened a six-game trip with their third straight loss. Tyler Anderson recovered from a rocky first inning to pitch six-hit ball into the seventh for the Angels. José Ureña pitched solidly into the fifth inning of his debut with the Blue Jays, who signed the right-hander Monday. Toronto is Ureña’s eighth team in the past six seasons. After Springer hit his fourth homer in the first, Taylor Ward answered with a two-run shot to center, ending his 1-for-35 slump. Santander then golfed a low breaking ball from Ryan Johnson into the short right-field porch with one out in the eighth. Héctor Neris (1-1) came on and got two outs, stranding two Blue Jays. Neto walked, stole second and scored the tying run when Ernie Clement couldn’t handle Alejandro Kirk’s throw to third after the catcher fielded Nolan Schanuel’s poor bunt off Yimi García (0-2).

The right-hander coaxed a double-play grounder from Jeff McNeil in the seventh to end his evening. It was the second time in a week that Gallen frustrated the Mets’ powerful lineup. He gave up just one run over six innings last Thursday in New York during Arizona’s 4-2 win. Gurriel gave the D-backs a 4-1 lead in the sixth by jumping on a first-pitch fastball that David Peterson left over the plate. The two-run shot scored Josh Naylor, who reached on a leadoff walk.

A week later, he was back in net and delivered the kind of quality goaltending they’ve gotten from him whenever he has been healthy. Andersen stopped 13 of the 14 shots he faced as the Hurricanes beat the Washington Capitals 2-1 in overtime in Game 1 of their second-round series. “Just really been looking forward to this for a while,” Andersen said. “Happy we could start off on the right foot.” Andersen was Carolina’s starter to begin the postseason and turned aside 88 of 94 shots before getting injured when New Jersey forward Timo Meier barreled into him in the second period of Game 4 last round. He gave way to backup Pyotr Kotchekov, who finished the job that night and did enough to advance with an overtime victory in Game 5. Extra time off allowed Andersen, a 35-year-old Dane in his 12th season in the league, to heal up. He was not tested much in the opener at Washington, but even the lack of action he had made it more challenging for a veteran coming off a long layoff. “Well that’s tough — it seems easy,” coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “He’s been here long enough (to know) you got to stay focused. And I thought he did a good job.” The Hurricanes pummeled the Capitals with 94 shots attempts: 33 that got on net — two of which went in past Logan Thompson — and 36 that got blocked before reaching him. After Logan Stankoven tied it midway through the third period, Andersen took space away on Ryan Leonard’s breakaway with just under six minutes, a play that did not count as a save but contributed to sending the game to overtime. “You could tell he was on it,” Brind’Amour said. “That was a huge one for us.” Carolina has been used to playing without Andersen, who missed half of 2023-24 getting treatment for blood clots and was out for a few months this season after knee surgery. But the organization showed how important Andersen is, signing him between rounds to a contract for next season, one that could see him earn up to $3.5 million. In his first game since getting that deal, Andersen rewarded the Hurricanes by making the saves he needed to make to give them a series led. “He’s huge for us,” Stankoven said. “We’re trying at the other end to create offense, and when we do give up chances or there are breakdowns, he’s there for us. And he’s been great all playoffs for us, so we’re going to need him to keep playing like that.” ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl"

PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Wild have entered a critical offseason, able to fully participate in free agency again after two years of significant salary cap constraints. Without an NHL playoff series win in the last 10 years, the urgency for the club to build a deeper roster around a promising young core is high — putting the pressure on general manager Bill Guerin this summer and into the upcoming season. “I’m more excited than anything. It’s been a long couple years, just dealing with this stuff and honestly just hearing about it,” said Guerin, who has been in his role for six years. “I want high expectations. I’m not doing this job sit in the corner or anything. These are big jobs. These are important jobs. There’s a lot of people out there who love the Minnesota Wild, and I’m trying to deliver something to them. We all are.” The first order of business is clear: an extension for Kirill Kaprizov. The star left wing has one year left on his current contract. “I’m very confident we’re going to get a deal done with Kirill. I think he really loves this market and this team,” Guerin said on Tuesday at Xcel Energy Center, five days after the Wild were eliminated on their home ice. “I think he feels that we’re going in the right direction.” Kaprizov, who has 386 points in 319 regular season games and 21 points in 25 playoff games with the Wild, said as much over the weekend. “I love everything here,” Kaprizov said. “Should be all good.” The Wild barely got in the playoffs in part because Kaprizov missed half of the season with a lower-body injury that required surgery. With five goals and four assists in the six-game loss to Vegas in the first-round series, Kaprizov made clear he was fully recovered. “He just wants to win, and I think this was a promising sign that our team can do it. We can get there. We’re so close,” said left wing Marcus Foligno, reflecting on the three straight one-goal losses that finished the series, including two in overtime. “I’ve got 100% confidence that we’ll get him here long term. Or I’ll just rip up his visa.” Guerin made the bold move four years ago of buying out the contracts of franchise cornerstones Zach Parise and Ryan Suter. The fresh start for team chemistry came at a cost, particularly for the last two seasons with the buyout charges accounting for about 17% of their salary cap. Those hits will be drastically reduced for 2025-26 and beyond until they’re gone. “I like to be aggressive. I don’t want to sit on my hands at all. I’m kind of tired of doing that,” Guerin said. “Since I walked through the door, my goal has been to build a championship-caliber team for this market, and that’s what I want to do. I don’t want to sign any stupid contracts or anything like that, but I want to make this team better than it is today.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL"

Robitaille expressed strong support for Hiller on Tuesday, one day after GM Rob Blake and the Kings mutually agreed to end Blake’s eight-year tenure. “Your general manager, you want to give him the freedom, you don’t want to lock up a new person that’s coming in, but the record of what Jimmy has done this year is really, really good,” Robitaille said at the Kings’ training complex. “It would be really hard for any GM to say, ‘Well, this guy shouldn’t come back.’ He’s been really good. I think Jimmy’s a great coach, and I fully think that this guy is coming back, for sure.” Hiller has been in charge of the Kings’ bench since February 2024, when the former assistant took over for the fired Todd McLellan. The Kings are 69-37-10 in Hiller’s first job as an NHL head coach, and they matched franchise records with 48 victories and 105 points this season before losing to Edmonton in the first round for the fourth consecutive postseason. Robitaille emphasized that the new GM would have the final say on the coaching staff, but the longtime team president reiterated his overall happiness with the state of the Kings’ roster, their coaching staff and even their style of play despite their repeated playoff disappointments. Robitaille made it clear that Blake supported the decision to seek new team leadership. Robitaille plans to hire a general manager who can provide a fresh perspective on how to change a talent-filled roster that can’t get it done in the postseason. “Blakey and I have been talking about it for probably a year,” Robitaille said. “He always said he wanted to wait to sign (a contract extension). I’m not going to get into detail about our conversation, but it’s something we talked about ... and we both agreed this was better for the franchise.” The former Kings teammates agreed that “it was time to probably bring a new voice just to get us to that next level,” Robitaille added. Los Angeles hasn’t won a playoff series since raising the Stanley Cup in 2014, and the Oilers have bounced the Kings in four straight springs. Los Angeles has won only eight total games in those four first-round series, and Hiller’s club lost its final four in a row last week after winning the first two at home. Robitaille didn’t sound close to hiring Blake’s replacement. He plans to examine multiple candidates, including Marc Bergevin, the former Montreal GM who was a senior adviser to Blake for the past 3 1/2 years. Robitaille isn’t waiting until he hires a new GM to begin preparations for next season. Working with assistant general manager Nelson Emerson, Robitaille has already spoken to pending unrestricted free agents Andrei Kuzmenko and Vladislav Gavrikov, who both played significant roles in Los Angeles’ late-season success. When asked what he sought in a replacement for a general manager of a team coming off one of the best regular seasons in franchise history, Robitaille emphasized the importance of evaluating the Kings’ roster with fresh eyes. “We had a good year ... but it’s sports, and you want to win the last game of the season,” Robitaille said. “That’s our goal.” Robitaille doesn’t necessarily want to see the Kings abandon their regimented, defense-oriented style of play under McLellan and Hiller, however. Fans often criticize Los Angeles’ style as old-fashioned and not offense-forward, but Robitaille offered a passionate defense of a team that stopped relying so heavily on the neutral-zone trap this season and finished 14th in the NHL in goals scored (249). “We had three of the best lines in hockey,” Robitaille said. “We scored goals. We had a 40% power play (at the end of the season). We felt like we needed to tweak our power play, and credit to our guys, they figured it out. Some teams have a 60-goal scorer. We don’t, but we have a lot of guys that can score goals. We play hard. We forecheck. We don’t sit back. ... We want to push.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL"

By Meg Kinnard April 14, 2025 08:06:43 AM We take a look at the Trump administration’s economic messaging after another week of reeling markets that saw the president reverse course on some of his steepest tariffs. Welcome to this week’s edition of AP Ground Game. Policy changes, but facts endure. AP delivers accurate, fact-based journalism to keep the world informed in every administration. Support independent reporting today. Donate. THE HEADLINES President Donald Trump gestures to reporters as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Sunday. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Trump team tries to project confidence and calm after tariff moves While his team was out defending his proposals on Sunday, Trump said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, whose production is concentrated in China. Rather, Trump said, “those products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” A week ago, Trump’s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10% universal tariff for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. Last week on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick played up national security. “You’ve got to realize this is a national security issue,” he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the U.S. were involved in a war. On Sunday, Lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. “The world cheats us. They’ve been cheating us for decades,” Navarro said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to U.S. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. Read more. Of note: With the higher rates set to be collected beginning April 9, administration officials argued last week that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. On Sunday, Navarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials. Greer said on CBS that his goal was “to get meaningful deals before 90 days” – the duration of Trump’s pause – “and I think we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.” Related reads ➤ Thune's 'old fashioned' approach to Senate has kept Trump on board so far The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace. It wasn’t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and — importantly for Thune — the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years. At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune said his message in conversations with the president was, “Let us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we’ll see where we go from there.” Read more. Of note: That approach has been successful so far, allowing the South Dakota Republican to show Trump the Senate’s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president’s Cabinet. Related reads ➤ What might El Salvador’s Bukele get by visiting Trump? Trump is hosting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a lynchpin of the U.S. administration's mass deportation operation. Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. More than 200 Venezuelan immigrants – whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes — and placed them inside the country's notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It is also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so. That has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country’s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported. Read more. Of note: Since Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit in February, Bukele — whose government has arrested more than 84,000 people as part of his three-year crackdown on gangs — has made it clear he’s ready to help the Trump administration with its deportation ambitions. Bukele struck a deal under which the U.S. will pay about $6 million for El Salvador to imprison the Venezuelan immigrants for a year. When a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn around a flight carrying the immigrants already en route to El Salvador, Bukele wrote on social media: “Oopsie ... too late.""

Trump says only 21 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza now believed to be alive,Trump says only 21 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza now believed to be alive,https://apnews.com/article/trump-hamas-gaza-israel-hostages-netanyahu-7848cad17dd47baaf21d171f3f5ea40d,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. “As of today, it’s 21, three have died,” Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting until recently it had been 24 people believed to be living. He did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. “There’s 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,” Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, had been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president’s comments came as Israel approved plans Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel’s operations there and likely draw fierce international opposition. Separately, the State Department said Tuesday that the U.S. embassy helped 17 U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents leave Gaza on Monday. “We thank our partners in the Israeli and Jordanian governments who made this departure possible,” the department said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Monday in Washington."

Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy is a driving force on the world stage,Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy is a driving force on the world stage,https://apnews.com/article/trump-transactional-diplomacy-tariffs-russia-ukraine-canada-e70f0e800b1c7891a0fa4f21a28c67af,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It’s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top. The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term. “President Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,” retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week. For Trump, it’s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft. It’s not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump’s actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe. He’s shaping a foreign policy that’s more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren’t meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance. Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world. The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what’s-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe. Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump’s “ledger” approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy. Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, “Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing.” “But diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,” Frantz said. “Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.” Trump on Thursday told reporters that he has decided to make Saudi Arabia the first overseas visit of his new term because the oil-rich kingdom has agreed to make a huge investment in the United States over the next four years. “They’ve gotten richer, we’ve all gotten older. So I said, ’I’ll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies,’” Trump said. He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment. Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America’s oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks. In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has “the cards” and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly. Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded. Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was “regrettable.” He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. — even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians — that Trump wants. In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy’s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials. But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia. “I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don’t have the cards,” Trump said. “In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.” Trump’s push on Zelenskyy — and pivot toward Moscow — marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War. Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden’s approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement. At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration. Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion. Kellogg, who also served in Trump’s first White House, recalled seeing Trump’s “transactional diplomacy approach” early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president’s first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same. “As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, ’What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?’'' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event. The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico. Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them. The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs. “Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,” Trump said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America’s 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump’s trade war. The episode has underscored Trump’s willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world’s most durable and amicable alliances. The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump’s move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary. “It’s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,” Trudeau said. “But Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.” ___ AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report."
Top US officials will meet with Chinese delegation in Switzerland in first major talks of trade war,Top US officials will meet with Chinese delegation in Switzerland in first major talks of trade war,https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-trade-switzerland-bessent-2a3335ed92989dc4b3a74ea550b79b3f,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Donald Trump sparked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their counterparts in Geneva in the most-senior known conversations between the two countries in months, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. It comes amid growing U.S. market worry over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods. No country has been hit harder by Trump’s trade war than China, the world’s biggest exporter and second largest economy. When Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, a move that Trump viewed as demonstrating a lack of respect. The tariffs on each other’s goods have been mounting since then, with the U.S. tariffs against China now at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%. American firms have already begun canceling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down as a result of the tariff war. After plans for the talks had been announced, Bessent said on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” that as the U.S. has engaged in negotiations with various trading partners, “China has been the missing piece.” The current situation, he said, “isn’t sustainable ... especially on the Chinese side.” He added that current high tariff levels were “the equivalent of an embargo. We don’t want to decouple. What we want is fair trade.” Trump had claimed previously that the U.S. and China were holding negotiations on lowering tariffs, which Beijing has denied, saying Trump must first lower his stiff tariffs. The Chinese Commerce Ministry on Tuesday confirmed the meeting between its vice premier and Bessent in Switzerland. “The Chinese side carefully evaluated the information from the U.S. side and decided to agree to have contact with the U.S. side after fully considering global expectations, Chinese interests and calls from U.S. businesses and consumers,” said a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson said China would not “sacrifice its principles or global equity or justice in seeking any agreement.” Most economists have said the cost of the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. And the higher prices are already becoming a burden on U.S. consumers, who are in the biggest economic funk since the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, economists say the risk of a recession is growing. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official and now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the upcoming meeting is a welcome development. “As the first face to face meeting between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since Trump’s inauguration, it’s an important opportunity to have initial talks on unwinding some tariffs, mapping out a path forward, as well as raising concerns,” Cutler said. “We should not expect any quick victories — this will be a process that will take time.” In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, according to readouts from their respective offices. Both Greer and Bessent had talked with their counterparts before the beginning of the trade war. Greer told Fox News Channel last month that he spoke with his Chinese counterpart for over an hour before the trade war started. “I thought it was constructive,” he said, adding: “This is not a plan just to encircle China. It’s a plan to fix the American economy, to have a greater share of manufacturing as GDP, to have real wages go up, to be producing things instead of having an economy that’s financed by the government.” And Bessent in February spoke with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng “to exchange views on the bilateral economic relationship,” according to a Treasury news release. ___ Associated Press writer Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report."
Senate confirms Bisignano to lead Social Security Administration as agency faces DOGE overhaul,Senate confirms Bisignano to lead Social Security Administration as agency faces DOGE overhaul,https://apnews.com/article/social-security-administration-bisignano-trump-doge-7ec043009064a58be57ce1465dec0481,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Wall Street veteran Frank Bisignano was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday to lead the Social Security Administration, taking over at a turbulent time for the agency that provides benefits to more than 70 million Americans. The Senate confirmed Bisignano in a 53-47 vote. Bisignano’s confirmation comes after a months-long series of announcements at the Social Security Administration of mass federal worker layoffs, cuts to programs, office closures and a planned cut to nationwide Social Security phone services, which were eventually walked back. Many of the changes are driven by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who said this week that he is preparing to wind down his role with the administration. The upheaval has made Social Security a major focus of Democrats, including former President Joe Biden, who said in his first public speech since leaving office that Republican President Donald Trump has “taken a hatchet” to the program. Bisignano, a self-professed “DOGE person,” has served as chair of Fiserv, a payments and financial services tech firm since 2020. He is a one-time defender of corporate policies to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. Bisignano takes over from the agency’s acting commissioner, DOGE supporter Leland Dudek. Bisignano’s term ends in January 2031. Asked during his March confirmation hearing whether Social Security should be privatized, Bisignano responded: “I’ve never heard a word of it, and I’ve never thought about it.” Democrats and activists have for weeks railed against Bisignano’s confirmation, holding rallies and other events protesting his nomination. During the final roll call vote, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden called Bisignano “unfit” to be the steward of Americans’ Social Security benefits. Wyden said Trump wants Bisignano to “gut” Social security, and that Republicans who support Bisignano’s confirmation would be to responsible if their grandmother misses a Social Security check and can’t pay rent. “By confirming Mr. Bisignano, the Senate will be signing a death sentence to Social Security as we know it today,” Wyden said. The chaos at the the agency began shortly after acting commissioner Michelle King stepped down in February, a move that came after DOGE sought access to Social Security recipient information. That prompted a lawsuit by labor unions and retirees, who asked a federal court to issue an emergency order limiting DOGE’s access to Social Security data. Most recently, the full panel of judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 9-6 not to lift restrictions on the access that DOGE has to Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans. Also in February, the agency announced plans to cut 7,000 people from the agency payroll through layoffs, employee reassignments and an offer of voluntary separation agreements, as part of an intensified effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce. Dudek also announced a plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices. That sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population. That plan has since been rolled back. The SSA provides benefits to roughly 72.5 million people, including retirees and children."
Canada’s Carney becomes the latest foreign leader to get the Trump treatment in the Oval Office,Canada’s Carney becomes the latest foreign leader to get the Trump treatment in the Oval Office,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mark-carney-oval-office-a6a9118ea26692c9658fde5c7355ce39,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A meeting between the leaders of Canada and the United States is not usually considered a high-stakes showdown, but there was little ordinary about this one. Here was newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney making his first visit to the Oval Office to see President Donald Trump, who has spent months musing about turning America’s northern neighbor into the 51st state. It didn’t take long for a reporter to ask about what was on everyone’s mind. Trump said he was still interested in annexing Canada, describing the border between the two countries as nothing more than an arbitrary line. Carney’s campaign was fueled by a wave of anger at Trump’s aggressive rhetoric, and now was his chance to defend his country to the president’s face. He was polite and firm. “Some places are never for sale,” Carney said. Canada is one of them, he added, and “it won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump gave a little shrug and raised his eyebrows. “Never say never,” he responded. Carney mouthed the words “never, never, never.” The interaction offered a glimpse into how Trump has transformed Oval Office meetings from brief and bland encounters into precarious affairs that often force foreign leaders to choose between placating or confronting the American president. His approach can be thrilling for supporters and destabilizing for diplomats accustomed to a more deliberative approach to international relations. “There is no formula for dealing with this,” said Daniel Mulhall, who was Ireland’s ambassador to the U.S. during Trump’s first term. He described the president’s unpredictable behavior as a “risk factor” and “an extraordinary departure from the norm.” It appears that Carney struck the right balance, at least in Trump’s mind. As the meeting ended, the president said, “I like this guy.” Carney grinned. An invitation to the Oval Office has long been the height of international prestige, but the meetings were rarely dramatic. Journalists were ushered into the room to take pictures and, if they were lucky, ask a couple of questions while leaders made perfunctory remarks. Now, they’re raucous episodes in a foreign policy reality show, starring Trump. While the president can be a gracious host, he openly complains about visitors’ countries — their trade policies, their lack of defense spending, their perceived ingratitude. He’s also willing to take question upon question on a range of topics from reporters, turning guests into silent spectators. Sixteen foreign leaders have visited the White House since Trump returned to office, outpacing Barack Obama and Joe Biden at similar points in their presidencies. “Thanks to this president’s commitment to transparency and accessibility, Americans can watch his foreign policy agenda play out in real time — presenting an opportunity for both foreign leaders and the president to convey their message to the American people,” said a statement from Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary. The meetings sometimes become endurance tests. On Tuesday, Carney listened to Trump criticize California’s delayed high-speed rail project, boast about upgrading the Oval Office with “great love and 24-karat gold” and make a surprise announcement that the U.S. would stop bombing the Houthis in Yemen. Trump also went on an extended tangent about Obama’s plans for his presidential library in Chicago, claiming that there are delays because his predecessor “only wants woke people to build it.” “He wanted to be very politically correct, and he didn’t use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers,” Trump claimed. As time dragged on, Carney’s lips tightened, his mouth twitched and his eyes darted around the room. He kept his hands clasped in front of him, except for largely futile gestures as he tried to get a word in. El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele was more at ease during his own meeting with Trump. He grinned as Trump bragged about getting “the highest mark” on his latest cognitive test, criticized a reporter’s “low ratings” and declared himself “very flexible” on tariffs. Elise Labott, a longtime journalist who is now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, dismissed the White House’s characterization of the encounters as evidence of the president being transparent. “It’s just another part of the show,” she said. Oval Office meetings, she added, have been “hijacked for part of the circus.” Foreign leaders often walk a careful line to avoid publicly confronting Trump, and they often rely on quick pivots when difficult subjects arise. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in the Oval Office while Trump talked about annexing Greenland — which is the territory of Denmark, another NATO ally. Rutte said, “I don’t want to drag NATO in that” and quickly shifted to an area of agreement. When it comes to the issue of security in the Arctic, Rutte told Trump, “you are totally right.” Jordanian King Abdullah II squirmed through a meeting where Trump explained his idea for the United States to take over Gaza and expel Palestinians from their homes. It’s among the most sensitive issues for Abdullah, whose country is home to more than two million Palestinian refugees, and he sidestepped questions about Trump’s proposal. It wasn’t until after the meeting that he posted about his opposition to Trump’s idea on social media. French President Emmanuel Macron was the rare leader to correct Trump without facing a backlash. When the U.S. leader claimed that Europe was lending Ukraine money — instead of donating it outright — Macron gently placed his left hand on Trump’s right forearm to interject. Trump rolled with it. “If you believe that, it’s OK with me,” he told reporters. No meeting has gone as poorly as Trump’s sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. After a heated exchange over the best way to end the war with Russia, Trump told him, “It’s going to be very hard to do business like this.” “You have to be thankful,” Trump told Zelenskyy. “You don’t have the cards.” As journalists left the room, Trump added, “This is going to be great television.” Rufus Gifford, former chief of protocol for Biden, said Trump was successful at little more than getting attention for himself. “Donald Trump has an ability to have eyeballs on him. That is, without a doubt, impressive,” he said. “But just because he’s able to get people to watch him doesn’t mean the strategy is smart or good for the United States of America.” Max Bergmann, a former State Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the meetings are “always going to be really challenging because the president can be volatile.” “It will give a lot of diplomats around the world pause about whether they want to schedule a meeting,” he said. But a meeting with Trump is a hard thing to avoid, especially for American allies. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer prepped intensively for his first encounter with Trump, understanding that the president prizes personal relationships and it’s hard to recover if he dislikes you. Starmer handed the president a written invitation from King Charles III for a state visit and praised him for returning a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office. He also thanked Trump for changing the conversation on Ukraine — even though he did that by siding more with Russia than European allies want. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin came out largely unscathed by taking a roll-with-the-punches approach — not contradicting Trump when he claimed Ireland “took” U.S. companies through “improper taxation” — while engaging the president over boxing and golf. “Every leader has to have their own strategy,” Mulhall said. __ Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report."
"Trump, Carney faceoff in Oval Office leaves gaping differences on tariffs, 51st state","Trump, Carney faceoff in Oval Office leaves gaping differences on tariffs, 51st state",https://apnews.com/article/canada-prime-minister-carney-trump-c279642998197ecb212f39bf38184388,"▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney faced off in the Oval Office on Tuesday and showed no signs of retreating from their gaping differences in an ongoing trade war that has shattered decades of trust between the two countries. The two kept it civil, but as for Trump’s calls to make Canada the 51st state, Carney insisted his nation was “not for sale” and Trump shot back, “time will tell.” Asked by a reporter if there was anything Carney could tell him to lift his tariffs of as much as 25% on Canada, Trump bluntly said: “No.” President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The U.S. president added for emphasis, “Just the way it is.” Carney acknowledged that no bit of rhetoric on tariffs would be enough to sway Trump, saying that “this is a bigger discussion.” “There are much bigger forces involved,” the Canadian leader continued. “And this will take some time and some discussions. And that’s why we’re here, to have those discussions.” The meeting between the two leaders showcased the full spectrum of Trump’s unique mix of aggression, hospitality and stubbornness. Shortly before Carney’s arrival, Trump insulted Canada by posting on social media that the United States didn’t need “ANYTHING” from its northern neighbor, only to then turn on the charm and praise Carney’s election win in person before showing his obstinance on matters of policy substance. Carney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump, even as he has preserved the calm demeanor of an economist who has led the central banks of both Canada and the United Kingdom. At times, Carney struggled to interject his views and raised his hand to talk as Trump held forth at length and veered between topics, touching on California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and teasing a “great” upcoming announcement that’s “not necessarily on trade.” Trump offended Canada’s sense of pride and friendship by saying he wants to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and levying steep tariffs against an essential partner in the manufacturing of autos and the supply of oil, electricity and other goods. The outrage provoked by Trump enabled Carney’s Liberal Party to score a stunning comeback victory last month as the trade war and attacks on Canadian sovereignty have outraged voters. Trump said the two would not discuss making Canada part of the U.S., even as he insisted the idea would lead to lower taxes for Canadians. “It’s not for sale,” Carney said. “It won’t be for sale. Ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.” Trump persisted by saying that the United States did not want to buy autos from Canada, even if the vehicles were also assembled in America. The U.S. leader insisted that the $63 billion trade deficit in goods — which he inflated to $200 billion — was a subsidy that needed to come an end. The meeting never devolved into the outburst that the public saw in Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was berated by the U.S. president and his team for not being sufficiently deferential. Nor did it have the ease of Trump’s sit down with the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who invited Trump for a visit provided by King Charles III. Carney later described his conversation with Trump as “wide ranging” and “constructive,” telling reporters that the prospect is there for positive negotiations but there would be “zigs and zags.” Carney said he stressed the value that Canadian companies and factories created for U.S. automakers while stressing that it was unfair to assume one meeting could resolve any differences. “I wouldn’t have expected white smoke coming out of this meeting,” Carney said after the Tuesday meeting, referencing the signal that a new pope has been selected. Carney said that he privately asked Trump to stop calling Canada the 51st state during their meeting. But when pressed on how Trump responded, the Canadian prime minister said: “He’s the president. He’s his own person.” Trump was later asked if he would give Carney the same “governor” nickname that he had put on Trudeau. The nickname was a slight meant to imply that Canada’s leader would eventually be just one of many U.S. governors. “As far as calling him Gov. Carney, no, I haven’t done that yet, and maybe I won’t,” Trump said. “I did have a lot of fun with Trudeau. But I think this is, this is a big step. It’s a good step up for Canada.” Trump added that the meeting with Carney had been “great” and that he thought the ongoing relationship would be “strong.” A senior Canadian government official said the president asked Carney his perspective on a variety of foreign policy issues including Iran, Russia, Ukraine and China. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said Trump was looking forward to the G-7 meeting in Alberta, Canada. The stakes of the meeting were high and the messages beforehand mixed. Trump told reporters on Monday that he wasn’t quite sure why Carney was visiting. “I’m not sure what he wants to see me about,” Trump said. “But I guess he wants to make a deal.” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick further stoked doubts about their interest in repairing the relationship with Canada in a Monday interview on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Asked if the U.S. could make a deal with Canada, Lutnick called the country a “socialist regime” that has been “basically feeding off America.” Lutnick said Tuesday’s meeting would be “fascinating.” Carney, at a Friday news conference ahead of his trip, said the talks would focus on immediate trade pressures and the broader economic and national security relationships. He said his “government would fight to get the best deal for Canada” and “take all the time necessary” to do so, even as Canada pursues a parallel set of talks to deepen relations with other allies and lessen its commitments with the U.S. President Donald Trump greets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump has maintained that the U.S. doesn’t need anything from Canada. He is actively going after a Canadian auto sector built largely by U.S. companies, saying, “They’re stopping work in Mexico, and they’re stopping work in Canada, and they’re all moving here.” He also said the U.S. doesn’t need Canada’s energy — though nearly one-fourth of the oil that the U.S. consumes daily comes from the province of Alberta. The president has also disparaged Canada’s military commitments despite a partnership that ranges from the beaches of Normandy in World War II to remote stretches of Afghanistan. He said on Tuesday with Carney that the U.S. would continue to provide national security support to Canada. Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and tariffs on other products outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in some cases ostensibly to address relatively low volumes of fentanyl intercepted at the northern border. That has jeopardized a closely entwined trade relationship as Canada sees an increasing need to build relations with the European Union and other nations. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S."
"Supreme Court allows Trump ban on transgender members of the military to take effect, for now","Supreme Court allows Trump ban on transgender members of the military to take effect, for now",https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-transgender-military-ban-ef67038857bd5b99e128bf0b8866afb4,"▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a ban on transgender people in the military, while legal challenges proceed. The court acted in the dispute over a policy that presumptively disqualifies transgender people from military service and could lead to the expulsion of experienced, decorated officers. The court’s three liberal justices said they would have kept the policy on hold. Neither the justices in the majority or dissent explained their votes, which is not uncommon in emergency appeals. Just after beginning his second term in January, Trump moved aggressively to roll back the rights of transgender people. Among the Republican president’s actions was an executive order that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life” and is harmful to military readiness. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the Supreme Court has acted to allow a transgender military service ban, for the time being. In response, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy in February that gave the military services 30 days to figure out how they would seek out and identify transgender service members to remove them from the force. Those actions had been stalled by the lawsuits. “No More Trans @ DoD,” Hegseth wrote in a post on X following Tuesday’s Supreme Court order. Earlier in the day, before the court acted, Hegseth said that his department is leaving wokeness and weakness behind. “No more pronouns,” he told a special operations forces conference in Tampa. “No more dudes in dresses. We’re done with that s—-.” The Defense Department said Tuesday that officials are currently determining the next steps, but officials were not aware of any actions being taken right away. Three federal judges had ruled against the ban. In the case the justices acted on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Benjamin Settle in Tacoma, Washington, had ruled for seven long-serving transgender military members who say that the ban is insulting and discriminatory and that their firing would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations. A prospective service member also sued. The individual service members who challenged the ban together have amassed more than 70 medals in 115 years of service, their lawyers wrote. The lead plaintiff is Emily Shilling, a Navy commander with nearly 20 years of service, including as a combat pilot who flew 60 missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The Trump administration offered no explanation as to why transgender troops, who have been able to serve openly over the past four years with no evidence of problems, should suddenly be banned, Settle wrote. The judge is an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and is a former captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps. Settle imposed a nationwide hold on the policy and a federal appeals court rejected the administration’s emergency plea. The Justice Department then turned to the Supreme Court. The policy also has been blocked by a federal judge in the nation’s capital, but that ruling has been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court, which heard arguments last month. The three-judge panel, which includes two judges appointed by Trump during his first term, appeared to be in favor of the administration’s position. In a more limited ruling, a judge in New Jersey also has barred the Air Force from removing two transgender men, saying they showed their separation would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations that no monetary settlement could repair. The LGBTQ rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation called the high court order a devastating blow to dedicated and highly qualified service members. “By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice. Transgender individuals meet the same standards and demonstrate the same values as all who serve. We remain steadfast in our belief that this ban violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and will ultimately be struck down,” the groups said in a statement. The federal appeals court in San Francisco will hear the administration’s appeal in a process that will play out over several months at least. All the while, though, the transgender ban will remain in place under the Supreme Court order. In 2016, during Barack Obama’s presidency, a Defense Department policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. During Trump’s first term in the White House, the Republican issued a directive to ban transgender service members, with an exception for some of those who had already started transitioning under more lenient rules that were in effect during Obama’s Democratic administration. The Supreme Court allowed that ban to take effect. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped it when he took office. The rules the Defense Department wants to enforce contain no exceptions. The policy during Trump’s first term and the new one are “materially indistinguishable,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the justices, though lawyers for the service members who sued disagreed. Thousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the 2.1 million troops serving. A senior defense official said in February that they believe there are about 4,200 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria currently serving in the active duty, National Guard and Reserves. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues, said that between 2015 and 2024, the total cost for psychotherapy, gender-affirming hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgery and other treatment for service members is about $52 million. ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board is unexpectedly removed from position,Vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board is unexpectedly removed from position,https://apnews.com/article/ntsb-vice-chair-removed-66319c7d69f248a9cbaf012845211922,"The vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board has been abruptly removed from his position, the White House confirmed Tuesday, a rare move that comes as the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters juggles more than 1,000 cases. The Trump administration removed Alvin Brown a little more than a year after he was sworn in for a term that was expected to end in 2026. The White House didn’t say why he was removed and Brown has not publicly commented. The decision comes as NTSB investigates nearly 1,250 active cases across the U.S., while supporting more than 160 foreign investigations, according to March testimony by NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. The investigations include the deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people in January and the medical transport plane that plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood that same month, killing eight people. It’s also investigating the catastrophic collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge in March 2024, which killed six construction workers. Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said he has never seen an administration remove a member of the board. Board members have been known to stay on after their term is over if the administration hasn’t appointed anyone yet and then they leave once the next administration selects someone else, he said. “That happens a lot over the years, but that’s normal and expected because you served your term and now it’s time for someone else to serve in there,” he said. “But this wasn’t that. This was just more abrupt and directly from the administration, and I don’t know what the impetus is.” By Tuesday evening, Brown’s photo and biography had already been removed from NTSB’s website. The agency includes five board members who serve five year terms, according to the NTSB website. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The chairman and vice chairman are both designated by the president and serve for three years. By Tuesday evening, the website only showed four members of the board. Brown was sworn in as a member of the board in April 2024 after being nominated by then-President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to fill one of two vacancies. His term was expected to run through 2026, according to an NTSB press release at the time. He was the only Black member of the board. He was the mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, from 2011 to 2015 and joined the board after serving as senior adviser for community infrastructure opportunities for the U.S. Department of Transportation, according to the release. The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators. It typically works on about 2,200 domestic and 450 foreign cases each year, according to Homendy. She said she expects “the number of cases annually to remain high and continue to increase in complexity.” The agency has been excluded from the deferred resignation program and probationary employee cuts to downsize the federal workforce. Homendy often presents NTSB as a lean agency “that plays a vital role in ensuring public safety and protection of life and property,” although she did ask for modest budget increases last year and this year. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report."
Lawmakers seek to rein in citizen ballot initiatives with new requirements for petitions,Lawmakers seek to rein in citizen ballot initiatives with new requirements for petitions,https://apnews.com/article/citizen-ballot-initiative-petition-2be9e9c2900d17d93ac588b136039d56,"Citizen activists supporting a public vote on important issues could have to brush up on their reading, writing and arithmetic if they want to get their initiatives on next year’s ballot in some states. A new Arkansas law will bar initiative ballot titles written above an eighth-grade reading level. And canvassers will have to verify that petition signers have either read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them. In South Dakota, sponsors will need to make sure their petition titles appears in 14-point type on the front page and 16-point font on the back, where people typically sign. And in Florida, volunteers will have to register with the state if they gather more than 25 petition signatures from outside their family or risk facing felony charges punishable by up to five years in prison. Across about dozen states, roughly 40 bills restricting or revamping the citizen initiative process have passed at least one legislative chamber this year, according to a review by The Associated Press. Many already have been signed into law. Some advocates for the initiative process are alarmed by the trend. “Globally, as there’s movements to expand direct democracy. In the United States it’s contracting,” said Dane Waters, chair of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, who has advised ballot campaigns in over 20 nations. Most of the new restrictions come from Republican lawmakers in states where petitions have been used to place abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other progressive initiatives on the ballot. GOP lawmakers contend their measures are shielding state constitutions from outside interests. “This is not a bill to restrict. It is a bill to protect — to make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity, and that it’s free of fraud,” said state Sen. Jennifer Bradley of Florida, where the new initiative requirements already have been challenged in court. About half the U.S. states allow people to bypass their legislatures by gathering signatures to place proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot. Since Oregon voters first used the process in 1904, a total of 2,744 citizen initiatives have appeared on statewide ballots, with 42% wining approval, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute. But the process has long caused tension between voters and their elected representatives. Lawmakers often perceive the initiative process as “an assault on their power and authority, and they want to limit it,” Waters said. “They view it, in my opinion, as a nuisance – a gnat that keeps bothering them.” Because initiative petitions require thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, groups sponsoring them often pay people to solicit signatures outside shopping centers and public places. Some states now prohibit payments based on the number of signatures gathered. States also are trying to restrict who can circulate petitions. A new Arkansas law requires paid petition canvassers to live in the state. And a new Montana law will make petition circulators wear badges displaying their name and home state. The new Florida law expanding registration requirements for petition circulators also requires them to undergo state training and bars canvassers who are noncitizens, nonresidents or felons without their voting rights restored. In addition to providing their name, address and birth date, people signing initiative petitions in Florida also will have to provide either their Florida driver’s license, state identification card or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That information is not required in other states, said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that has backed dozens of ballot initiatives in states. Hall said people concerned about privacy might hesitate to sign petitions. “I work in ballot measures, and I deeply support many of the things that folks have tried to put on the ballot in Florida, ” Hall said, “and I don’t know if I could bring myself to do that – that’s a very prohibitive requirement.” Many states already prescribe a particular format for initiative petitions. South Dakota’s new mandate for specific font sizes was prompted by allegations that some people got duped into signing a petition for abortion rights last year, said sponsoring state Sen. Amber Hulse, a Republican. Printing the ballot title in large type “might make it harder for some issues to get on the ballot if people know what they’re signing. But that’s actually a good thing,” Hulse said. Before they can collect signatures, petition sponsors must get approval from state officials. New measures in several states give those officials greater authority. New Arkansas laws allow the attorney general to reject initiatives written above an eighth-grade reading level or which conflict with the U.S. Constitution or federal law. Utah’s lieutenant governor, who already can reject unconstitutional petitions, now also will be able to turn away petitions that are unlikely to provide adequate funding for their proposed laws. A new Missouri law gives greater power to the secretary of state, instead of judges, to rewrite ballot summaries struck down as being insufficient or unfair. Most states require only a majority vote to amend their constitutions, though Colorado requires 55% approval and Florida 60%. Republican-led legislatures in North Dakota and South Dakota approved measures this year proposing a 60% public vote to approve future constitutional amendments, and Utah lawmakers backed a 60% threshold for tax measures. All three propositions still must go before voters, where they will need only a majority to pass. Voters rejected similar proposals in Ohio, Arkansas and South Dakota in recent years, but they approved a 60% threshold for tax measures in Arizona. Lawmakers contend the move has merit. “Raising the threshold can help protect the constitution from being manipulated by special interest groups or out-of-state activists,” North Dakota House Majority Leader Mike Lefor said earlier this year. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Dura and Kate Payne contributed to this report. ___ Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

"Alabama lawmakers approve tax cuts for food, diapers and other items","Alabama lawmakers approve tax cuts for food, diapers and other items",https://apnews.com/article/alabama-legislature-tax-cut-food-education-daa9df493bf0bcf31828f873d06bb397,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday voted to cut the state sales tax on food and to exempt diapers, baby formula and menstrual hygiene products from the state sales tax altogether. The Alabama Senate approved both bills by votes of 34-0. The bills now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. The food tax reduction comes as lawmakers in both parties said families are being hurt by soaring grocery prices. The reduction, if signed into law, will lower the state sales tax on food from 3% to 2% beginning Sept. 1. Lawmakers in 2023 reduced the tax from 4% to 3%. An additional reduction to 2% was planned but hinged on budget growth that did not materialize. “We’re still one of a few states that taxes groceries. We’re headed toward zero taxes, we’re headed in the right direction. This is big,” Republican Rep. Danny Garrett, the sponsor of the bill, said. The reduction will cost the state about $121 million annually in tax revenue that would otherwise goes to the Education Trust Fund. The leader of Alabama Arise, an advocacy group that supports policies that help low-income families, said the grocery tax belongs in the “dustbin of history.” “The grocery tax drives many families deeper into poverty, and Arise remains committed to the goal of eliminating it entirely,” Alabama Arise Executive Director Robyn Hyden said. Lawmakers also approved a bill that will exempt baby formula, maternity clothing, diapers and menstrual hygiene products from state sales tax. Baby wipes, breast pumps and bottles would also be exempt. The exemption from the 4% sales tax will cost the state about $13 million annually. “This is a big win for Alabama’s working families,” Democratic Rep. Neil Rafferty, the sponsor of the bill, wrote on social media about the approval."
A man with an open asylum case was deported. His lawyers want to know if there are others,A man with an open asylum case was deported. His lawyers want to know if there are others,https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportation-settlement-el-salvador-77475d1e00b7e12ee2950e97df869d60,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become a household name as the Trump administration is engaged in an intense legal campaign to keep him locked up in an El Salvador prison despite his mistaken deportation. But his case isn’t the only one of its kind inching through the U.S. court system. Nearly two months have passed since a 20-year-old Venezuelan native, known only as Cristian in court filings, was deported to El Salvador despite having a pending asylum application. Now his lawyers want to know if there are others like him. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher stopped short of ordering the Trump administration to produce a list of any others who are in the same legal situation as Cristian. But the judge made it clear during a hearing Tuesday that she won’t second-guess her earlier order for the Trump administration to facilitate Cristian’s return to the U.S. Gallagher, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, said it is a “fair inference” that the administration has done nothing to comply with her April 23 decision. She gave the government until Thursday to appeal her ruling before she considers ordering specific steps to comply with the order. Gallagher said the case isn’t about whether Cristian is entitled to asylum if he is able to return to the U.S. “The issue is and always has been one of process,” the judge said. “People are entitled to that.” Abrego Garcia and Cristian both were deported on March 15. Dozens of other people were flown from the U.S. to El Salvador after Trump issued a proclamation calling for the arrest and removal of Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law. Cristian had been transferred into federal custody from a jail in Harris County, Texas, in January. Abrego Garcia was arrested in Maryland, where he lived with his wife — a U.S. citizen — and their children. Unlike Cristian, Abrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador. A U.S. immigration judge’s order in 2019 protected him from being sent there because he likely faced persecution by local Salvadoran gangs that terrorized him and his family. Gallagher ruled that the government violated a 2019 settlement agreement when it deported Cristian. She said she was guided by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ ruling that Trump’s Republican administration must facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. “Standing by and taking no action is not facilitation,” Gallagher wrote. “In prior cases involving wrongfully removed individuals, courts have ordered, and the government has taken, affirmative steps toward facilitating return.” Gallagher said her order requires the government to make “a good faith request” for the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody. Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. The judge set May deadlines this month for administration officials to testify under oath about what they have done to comply. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys said the administration was moving toward bringing him back when it asked for a pause in the court case last month. “We agreed to that request because we understood it to be made in good faith,” the lawyers said in a news release. “Unfortunately, one week later, it remains unclear what, if anything, the government has done in the past seven days to bring our client home to his family.” The Justice Department is likely to appeal Gallagher’s rulings in Cristian’s favor. Any appeal would be heard by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime, Gallagher refused Tuesday to suspend her April 23 decision. The judge scheduled Tuesday’s hearing to find out what, if anything, the government has done to comply with her order to facilitate Cristian’s return. Justice Department attorney Richard Ingebretsen merely told her that the State Department was notified of her ruling. “That is the extent of the information,” Ingebretsen added. One of Cristian’s attorneys, Kevin DeJong, dismissed that response as a “non-answer” and expressed concern that the administration is trying to avoid complying with the judge’s order. Ingebretsen said immigration officials have determined that Cristian isn’t entitled to asylum. But the man’s lawyers said he has a right to get a ruling on the merits of his asylum application by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Meanwhile, Cristian’s lawyers want to know if the U.S. has deported other people who are covered by the same settlement that benefited him. “There may well be other class members removed and we don’t know about it,” DeJong said. “It’s not acceptable.”"
Judge expresses sympathy for fired federal workers but questions if reinstatement is proper remedy,Judge expresses sympathy for fired federal workers but questions if reinstatement is proper remedy,https://apnews.com/article/trump-federal-workers-fired-court-b54674c187fbe9a9d07555ee7ce9b3a6,"A federal judge expressed sympathy on Tuesday for thousands of federal employees who were suddenly fired by the Trump administration earlier this year, but he also voiced skepticism about whether reinstating them to their jobs was a proper remedy and questioned what the courts could ultimately do. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson made the comments during a hearing in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, as part of a lawsuit brought by 19 states and the District of Columbia. The suit alleges the states were harmed by the mass firings of probationary workers, because states did not have warnings required by law to help them prepare for the unemployed. “Part of me thinks that the voters may be the ones to render a final verdict on this,” Wilkinson said. “There are limits to what the courts can do, but there are also gigantic political costs to throwing out so many employees, and in one sense the final verdict may be one for the voters to render. I’m not saying that’s the whole answer, but maybe it’s a part of it.” While a federal judge in Baltimore issued an order in March to require the federal government to reinstate the employees, the federal appeals court halted it. The states are seeking further review as the lawsuit plays out, but Wilkinson said full reinstatement of the employees sounded like an overly broad remedy during Tuesday’s hearing. Caroline Van Zile, the solicitor general of the District of Columbia, argued that the District of Columbia and states have been harmed due to the lack of 60 days’ notice and information about layoffs required in the law when the federal government conducts a reduction in force. The time and information was set by Congress to help states respond, she said. “They have made us the ones responding to unemployment crises like this, not the federal government — the states,” Van Zile said. “We are the ones left holding the bags by statute, and that’s exactly why they gave us this right to information.” But Sarah Welch, an attorney for the appellants, said information has been provided, and she also contended that the probationary employees in question were not dismissed due to what’s known as a reduction in force, which triggers the 60-day warning and information requirements that the states say they did not receive. “These agencies did not conduct (reductions in force.) They haven’t eliminated positions, and there’s been not a shred of evidence that agencies through the terminations of probationary employees that are challenged here have eliminated a single position or changed their agency functions, which would be the calling cards of a RIF,” Welch said. Probationary workers have been targeted for layoffs across the federal government because they’re usually new to the job and lack full civil service protection. While expressing sympathy for the workers, Wilkinson said “there seems to be a disconnect between the harm alleged and the remedy imposed.” “The remedy has to be tailored to the violation, and here the remedy is very broad, and much broader than the actual violation, and as just as a basic matter of equity, that’s a difficult proposition,” the judge said. But Van Zile said she believed U.S. District Judge James Bredar got it right in his order, when he said that agencies can’t engage in far-reaching illegal activity “and then complain that the remedy is too burdensome.” “They are the ones who terminated 24,000 employees in a single go,” Van Zile said. “That harm was wrought on the states. We had no agency, no way to avoid that harm.” Bredar was one of two judges appointed by Democratic presidents who found that the Trump administration violated federal laws in carrying out the terminations at 20 agencies in the states that sued. The Supreme Court blocked another order from U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, finding that nonprofit groups lacked legal standing to sue over the firing of probationary workers. During Tuesday’s hearing, Wilkinson also questioned whether reinstating the employees would give states too much influence over the composition of the federal workforce. While the judge said he has sympathy for how individuals have been affected, “there’s a real question here of what the federal remedy could be that wouldn’t really significantly damage the federal government’s control over the composition of its own workforce.” The states suing the Trump administration in the Baltimore case are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin, along with Washington, D.C."

But a previous trip to the Museum of Modern Art, for its “Harlem On My Mind” exhibit, had already begun to lay down his fashion foundation. “When I saw those photographs of elegant Harlemites promenading up and down Seventh Avenue and Lennox Avenue ... the raccoon coats and fox coats, and spangled gowns, and bowler hats — all this satirical splendor ... I thought, ‘Oh! There is another way for me to be authentically Black,’” recalled the New York-based cultural and architectural historian, now 69. The style Adams would embrace had a name: dandyism. And dandyism was at the heart of Monday’s Met Gala, where many of the world’s most famous and influential tastemakers donned their luxury best to kick off the “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” exhibit. But Black dandyism isn’t limited to expensive couture — it’s displayed daily. Cultural and architectural historian Michael Henry Adams poses for a portrait on Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) “It’s everywhere in the Black community, the notion of what a dandy is,” explained Adams, who was photographed for the “Superfine” catalog. “The ingeniousness and ingenuity and creativity of Black people, so far as fashion was concerned, it’s always been with us.” As the menswear-focused exhibit — the Costume Institute’s first to exclusively display Black designers — opens to the public Saturday, here are tips from dandies on embracing the style in everyday life. Dandies say the key to a distinctive look first begins on the inside. “Fashion’s a sense of personality. Two guys can go to the same store and get the same outfit and look totally different,” said Guy Wood, 62, the stylish co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. Inspired by family members and dapper Harlem neighbors, he developed a knack for style early. “It’s confidence ... you walk in the room, and all the heads turn.” Michael Andrew, a 42-year-old Atlanta-based style consultant, first delved into dandyism after being inspired by Fonzworth Bentley, most recognized as Sean “Diddy” Combs’ often-photographed assistant and umbrella holder in the early 2000s. Bentley’s colorful outfits and tailored outfits separated himself from the hip-hop era’s prevalent baggy look. Style advisor, Michael Andrew, poses for a portrait on Friday, May 2, 2025, in Atlanta. (Photo by Paul R. Giunta/Invision/AP) “A lot of guys think that being a dandy is about being over the top,” said Andrew, who was photographed for Rose Callahan’s 2013 book “I Am Dandy: The Return of the Elegant Gentleman.” “For me, dandyism is the highest form of taste with self-expression.” The foundation of dandyism rests upon tenets such as bold colors and fine tailoring, but there’s no singular way to achieve the look. Each dandy creates their own unique style, often centered on specific elements. For Wood, who refers to crafting looks as making gumbo, it starts with suits. “Wearing a suit, you just feel important,” said Wood, who often pairs them with brogue shoes of various bright colors. “We love well-tailored.” James McFarland, an 80-year-old master tailor, says a dandy’s affinity for tailoring is easy to understand: “It’s very simple: we’re a visual world. When you wear something that’s fine tailored and it’s fitting you well, people look at that.” Known as “Gentleman Jim,” McFarland was tutored by Orie Walls, the go-to Harlem-based tailor of the 1960s. McFarland says they crafted suits for nearly every famous Black male celebrity of the time, from Duke Ellington to Jackie Robinson to Muhammad Ali — as well as some of the era’s most infamous characters, like gangsters Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson. He says wearing a suit “makes you feel better. You ever heard the term styling and profiling?” While Adams, the historian, is drawn to bow ties, buck shoes and straw hats, Andrew says the beauty of dandyism is making it your own. “Texture is the must-have when you start talking about dandyism — textures and patterns. The great point here is that dandies always have their thing. And so, for me, hats are my thing,” Andrew said, adding that small accessories, like stylish wool or cashmere socks and pocket squares, can easily elevate a look. “Now, it’s starting to become glasses. … Every dandy has the opportunity to utilize something.” Guy Wood, co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) Wood says creativity is essential to becoming a dandy — not a high income. “That’s a cheat code,” said Wood. “It is being creative … most of us don’t have a lot of money. You might go in your mom’s closet and (think), ‘Oh, that scarf is fly.’ You tie it around your neck and lay it over your shoulder. You just can’t be scared.” Adams says while style and inspiration can go hand-in-hand, individuality should always be paramount. “People should find their truth and aspire to look like themselves,” he said, noting he shops at a variety of stores, from the high-end Brooks Brothers to off-price and discount stores like Marshalls and K&G Fashion. “Part of the thing that made me rebel against looking like ‘Super Fly’ or ‘Shaft’ is I didn’t want to look like everybody else.” Jacques Agbobly, a designer whose clothes are featured in the Met exhibit, agrees. “There are people who would really just think it’s about the suit that you’re wearing and the top hat … but for me, and I think that’s what this exhibition does really fondly, is really putting together a group of amazing clothing that really redefines what dandyism is,” he said. For the Togo-born designer, “taking up space is a sort of open-ended thing in a way,” whether it’s achieved through colors, silhouettes or fabric choices. Rising designer Jacques Agbobly (AP video shot by Joseph Frederick, AP interview/production by Gary Gerard Hamilton) A general consensus among dandies is that society has embraced casualness, shunning the well-dressed looks of the past. McFarland, the tailor, says his profession isn’t as admired or used in U.S. as it was years ago. He teaches fine tailoring as he has for decades, and is planning to start a podcast to discuss the craft and his adventures styling celebrities of his era. “When I grew up, I wanted to look like the people in the neighborhood,” he said, explaining his mother couldn’t afford the clothes he wanted, leading him to tailoring. “Everybody, male and female, was dressed up.” Andrew hopes that same stylish spirit of yesteryear can make a resurgence, believing appearance and pride work together. “I would challenge or would encourage all of us, especially as Black people, to remember our history, to remember that we used to throw on our Sunday’s best,” he said. “We wanted to show up as the best versions of ourselves.” The “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” exhibit, which will run through October, is sure to introduce visitors to the most elevated forms of Black dandyism. But for Wood and fellow daily dandies, it’s just business as usual. “The fact that the Met realizes that is a beautiful thing,” he said with a sly smile. “But we’ve been doing this forever and we really not paying attention to it.

Smokey Robinson accused by former housekeepers of sexual assault and rape,Smokey Robinson accused by former housekeepers of sexual assault and rape,https://apnews.com/article/smokey-robinson-la-lawsuit-sexual-assault-1512119eb018782fffad29d1d0358724,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Four former housekeepers of Smokey Robinson allege in a lawsuit filed Tuesday that the Motown music luminary repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped them while they worked for him. The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024, and labor violations including a hostile work environment, illegally long hours and lack of pay. A message seeking comment from a representative for the 85-year-old Robinson was not immediately answered. The four women each say that Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house then sexually assault and rape them over their objections. “We believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,” the women’s attorney John Harris said at a news conference. All said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. “Having to tell their husband and children of these despicable actions left them filled with shame and embarrassment,” Harris said. “So throughout their dreadful experiences with Mr. Robinson, all four women remained silent.” He said as low-wage earners, they also all feared “missing a payday, and not being able to afford rent or buy food for their families.” All four women withheld their legal names citing privacy concerns and are identified as Jane Does in court documents. They appeared at the news conference with their attorneys, but did not speak, and covered their faces with masks. The lawsuit also names Robinson’s wife Frances Robinson as a defendant, alleging that she enabled his behavior despite knowing about past sexual misconduct. It also blames her for the hostile work environment, saying she berated them with language that included ethnic slurs. One woman said she worked for the Robinsons from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said she worked for them from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times. Another said she worked for them for a year before quitting in 2024 and was assaulted at least seven times. The fourth woman, who said she also acted as Frances Robinson’s personal assistant, hairdresser and cook, worked for them for 18 years before resigning in 2024. She cited similar experiences to the other women, but did not say how often she was assaulted. The women, some of whom worked for the Robinsons at the same time as each other, also kept stories of the assaults from one another, but are now bonding over their experience, the attorneys said. They declined to give details at the news conference about how they came forward and learned there were others. The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations. “Obviously, no amount of money can compensate these women for what Mr. Robinson put them through,” Harris said. But he said the $50 million was warranted “based on the gravity of Mr. Robinson’s despicable and reprehensible misconduct.” Plaintiffs’ attorney Herbert Hayden said that while they felt the assaults are worthy of criminal investigation, the women have not filed police reports, based on the same fears that kept them from coming forward. Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s — both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including “Tears of a Clown” and “The Tracks of My Tears.” He was a central part of the Motown Records music machine in his hometown of Detroit as an artist, producer and songwriter for other artists."
"In pinstripes and hats, with canes and twists on suiting, Met Gala crowd largely did menswear proud","In pinstripes and hats, with canes and twists on suiting, Met Gala crowd largely did menswear proud",https://apnews.com/article/met-gala-fashion-2025-best-worst-dressed-9a93c25c4bf01db1e35450d7f21f744c,"NEW YORK (AP) — Pinstripes. All Ways. Hats galore. Pantsuits. Gown suits. Zoot suits. Canes. A single cigar (looking at you Madonna) — and expert displays of tailoring. The Met Gala crowd, for the most part, did the Black dandy menswear theme proud at fashion’s biggest party of the year. “Those that researched the moment and pulled inspiration from history made it modern and their own. I loved it,” said Holly Alford, assistant dean and an associate professor in the fashion and merchandising program at Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts. Among her favorites: Colman Domingo’s homage to dandy icon André Leon Talley. It was one of many that honored the towering fashion figure, a rare Black fashion editor in a largely white industry. And among others in odes to Talley, who died in 2022, were Anne Hathaway in a Carolina Herrera dress she picked specifically for him. “We wanted André Leon Talley to look down from heaven and scream ‘GLAMOUR,’” Hathaway said on the Vogue livestream Monday night. A glamorous night it was, and an inventive one at that amid a broad White House siege on DEI programs and protections that serve immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and myriad others. What does that have to do with fashion and the theme this year? Everything, in terms of Black power, ownership, heritage and, most importantly, freedom. What, exactly, was the suggested dress code? It was “Tailored for You,” inspired by Black dandyism through time, the subject of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s spring show at its Costume Institute. On the blue carpet, a bit soggy from drenching rain, guests played with the fundamentals of fashion to make their looks their own with the help of designers and stylists. And many honored their heritages in special touches like the cowrie shells on the cuffs of Lewis Hamilton’s Wales Bonner jacket. The shells pay homage to Black diasporic culture, to spirituality, to memory, said Rikki Byrd, assistant professor of visual culture studies at the University of Texas at Austin and founder of the Black Fashion Archive. Tessa Thompson honored Talley with a fan adorned with his image. “It’s representative of a church fan and André Leon Talley often talked about his first introduction to fashion was through his church,” Byrd said. Teyana Taylor was a standout for Shantrelle P. Lewis, author of “Dandy Lion: The Black Dandy and Street Style.” With her cane, in her red velvet cape, “she understood the assignment,” Lewis said. Taylor’s cape was emblazoned with her nickname in honor of her home turf: “Harlem Rose.” And she, like Swizz Beatz, donned a durag. Lewis, who has been seminal in understanding dandyism, said the attire on the carpet was generally underwhelming. “The lack of color, the lack of African print, even the absence of African designers. I said, ‘Where is the Black dandyism?’” she said. “No sartorial risks were taken.” Big risks? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Brandon Tan, fashion director for Cosmopolitan, was satisfied. “A classic silhouette can be completely reimagined by something as simple as the color and fabrication of the textile, as seen on Henry Golding,” he said. “Inversely, a very classic gray wool can be totally remixed by the cut and silhouette like Walton Goggins’ kilt look by Thom Browne.” A few simply showed up in comparatively routine black tuxedos (hello James Corden) and questionable spins on the theme (Sorry, Halle Berry, but that was a lot of skin in the crotch area). Coattails of varying lengths were a huge trend amid the sea of hats and head pieces anticipated ahead of the gala that brought together A-listers from the worlds of sports, entertainment, music, art, literature, politics and more to raise money for the Costume Institute. Black and white looks carried the night, with enough pops of color to keep it interesting. Kevin Huynh, InStyle’s fashion director, also praised Domingo, who wore a huge Talley-esque collared blue cape first, then ditched the cape to reveal a pearled window-pane jacket he wore with dot accessories. “As the undisputed king of the red carpet, his regal look was beyond appropriate for the night’s theme,” Huynh said. “He fully embodied the spirit of dandyism in not one but two statement-making looks from Valentino, and he aced it in terms of being unapologetically bold and flawlessly fanciful.” That “fearlessness and individuality,” he said, is what the night was all about. “After a marathon awards season run, his Met Gala red carpet reveal was well worth the wait. From the moment he stepped out of The Carlyle draped in a jewel-toned Valentino cape, it was clear that more was coming,” said Claire Stern Milch, Elle’s digital director. “And when he finally arrived on the steps, his custom three-piece zoot suit, also designed by Alessandro Michele, was a playful and sophisticated nod to the theme,” she added. Milch called Domingo’s oversized polka dot flower on one lapel undoubtedly the highlight. The look, she said, was the “perfect marriage of classic tailoring and avant-garde flair.” Nikki Ogunnaike, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire, noted that suiting of all kinds wasn’t a huge surprise, considering the style guidance from Vogue’s Anna Wintour, who puts the gala together each year. “My favorites included Ayo Edebiri in Ferragamo, Tracee Ellis Ross in Marc Jacobs, Zendaya and Lisa in Louis Vuitton, Colman Domingo in Valentino and Mindy Kaling in Harbison, all of whom interpreted dandyism and suiting in their own unique way,” she said. Athletes, meanwhile, also took the spotlight. Tailoring for them is a special craft that Tom Marchitelli, custom menswear designer and stylist, takes into consideration with all the suits he creates for NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball players. “These guys have these superhero builds, as I like to say, and they can’t walk into any store on Fifth Ave, in Rodeo, anywhere and just pick out a suit off the rack to fit them,” he said. Marchitelli said he appreciated the clean form-fitting looks on Philadelphia Eagles players Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley. “To have this many athletes showcased, I think that says a lot about how important sport is to culture, pop culture in America, how influential the athletes are,” he said. The night’s vibe was inspired by the exhibit called “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” It’s the first Costume Institute show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Big-time Black designers and smaller brands of creatives of color were represented on the carpet. They included Sergio Hudson, LaQuan Smith and Ozwald Boateng, a former wunderkind of Savile Row. So who are some others who blew it, or didn’t even try to spin the theme? Blackpink’s Lisa might have walked the line in her look by Vuitton, a gala sponsor. She went pantless with little faces on black undies to go with her matching jacket and LV logo sheer stockings. Some on social media thought the faces were Rosa Parks. They weren’t, a representative told The Cut, explaining they were “portraits of figures who have been a part of the artist’s life.” OK. So it goes. Undie portraits might not be a good idea in general. As for Corden, The Cut posted a video of him in his mere mortal look and viewers threw some barbs, including one who called him “James Boredon” giving “a total snooze fest per usual.” Ouch, James. ___ For more coverage of the 2025 Met Gala, visit https://apnews.com/hub/met-gala."

Police told KABC-TV that the “Friends” star was home at the time of the crash. The incident occurred around 12:20 p.m. Monday on the 900 Block of Airole Way in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood, according to Officer Jeff Lee of the LA Police Department. Online property records show a home on that block owned by a trust run by Jennifer Aniston’s business manager. Private security guards apprehended the driver and held him until police arrived. Lee described the suspect as a white middle-aged man. He has not been identified, and no charges had been filed as of Tuesday morning, Lee said. “He used his vehicle to ram a gate to the residence,” Lee said. Messages were left Tuesday with representatives and attorneys for Aniston. Aniston, currently starring in Apple TV’s “Morning Show,” purchased the midcentury mansion on a 3.4-acre lot for about $21 million in 2012, according to reporting by Architectural Digest."

Twelve jurors along with six alternates will be chosen, with opening statements expected to begin May 12. The trial is expected to last at least eight weeks. Here’s a look at some of the details. Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty. The alleged offenses span from about 2004 until about 2024. Two of the counts were added a month before trial. The indictment against him says he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. Prosecutors allege he used his “power and prestige” as a music star to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers in events dubbed “freak offs.” Prosecutors revealed shortly before trial that Combs rejected a plea agreement that might have meant a lighter sentence than a conviction could. They did not disclose the terms of the proposed deal. Without identifying them publicly, prosecutors have said four of Combs’ accusers will testify at the trial. The prosecution will be allowed to show the jury security video of Combs beating and kicking one of his accusers, the R&B singer Cassie, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Diddy’s attorneys are expected to argue at trial that the government is demonizing and distorting the sexual activity of consenting adults. They have also argued that two of Combs’ longtime girlfriends willingly brought a male sex worker into their relationship. Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, was Combs’ on-again-off-again romantic partner for more than a decade. Her 2023 lawsuit against Combs alleging years of abuse, including rape, began the scrutiny that eventually led to his prosecution. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Ventura did. The trial is in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian. He’s a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and was appointed a federal judge by President Joe Biden in 2022. The prosecution team consists of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was among the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Combs’ team of seven defense attorneys is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending Luigi Mangione, the man accused of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also on the defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that went on for nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges. Combs, 55, has been held at a federal jail in Brooklyn since his September arrest. His formerly jet-black hair is now almost completely gray because dye isn’t allowed at the detention center. Combs, who had his own fashion line, has worn yellow jail uniforms in pretrial hearings. But for the trial, the judge said he can have up to five button-down shirts, five pairs of pants, five sweaters, five pairs of socks and two pairs of shoes without laces. Under federal court rules, no photos or video of the trial will be allowed. Courtroom sketches are permitted. Since 2023, dozens of women and men have been filing lawsuits against Combs claiming he sexually or physically abused them. Many of those people said they were slipped drugs at events hosted by Combs and were abused while they were incapacitated. Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers. Some of those lawsuits have claimed that other celebrities were either present for or participated in the abuse. The great majority of those allegations, however, aren’t part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on a relatively small number of accusers and allegations where there is physical evidence or corroboration by witnesses."

They’re a benevolent group of wee blue villagers who, you know, want to love one another and lead productive lives while fending off the world’s forces of evil, usually represented by the machinations of some wizards out for ill gotten gains.” “Eddington” (A24, theaters): Ari Aster re-teams with Joaquin Phoenix for this film about a standoff between a small-town sheriff and a mayor in the early months of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler also star.

James Gunn predicts summer of ‘Superman’ to the rescue of the box office,James Gunn predicts summer of ‘Superman’ to the rescue of the box office,https://apnews.com/article/warner-bros-superman-james-gunn-c2c66cf059138b1cfa90da8d9dc24e19,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The 2025 box office has been hit with a deficit. Can the James Gunn-dubbed “summer of ‘Superman’” save it? Warner Bros. showed off a diverse and starry slate of its upcoming films on Tuesday, but the night was carried on the shoulders of Clark Kent. “I really do believe in this movie. And I do believe that there is a lack of human kindness, or at least a degradation of human kindness,” Gunn said. “This is a movie that celebrates kindness and human love.” At the annual CinemaCon convention and trade show in Las Vegas, Gunn — the director and writer of the first film in the new iteration of the connected DC Universe — brought out its stars, who gushed over their experience making the film. “It’s a great honor to play a role that exists so clearly in the public consciousness, to the point where everyone I think, even if you haven’t seen a film or read a comic, you sort of know what the Superman symbol means and you know what it stands for,” said David Corenswet, adding that he hopes to “illuminate something new about the character, or even just bring the beloved character to a new audience.” Corenswet was joined onstage by Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Lois Lane, and Nicholas Hoult, who plays Lex Luthor. “James makes a family out of every set,” Brosnahan said. “The set is full of people who want to be there, who love making these movies. And it’s such a joy to come to work every day. As many of you have probably heard from other people, it’s not always like that.” Gunn was announced as the film’s director in 2023, shortly after he and Peter Safran became co-chairs and co-CEOs of DC Studios. “We appreciate and share your passion for this art form,” Safran told a room full of theater owners. “It’s the fulcrum of our ambitious DC Studios slate and it’s what inspired James to shoot all over the world and push filmmaking technology to its limits, to propel moviegoers out of their homes into your theaters.” The film will be released theatrically in July amid a summer of superhero titles, including “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” and “Thunderbolts.” In addition to “Superman,” Warner Bros. teased some of its April releases on the convention’s main stage, like Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” and “A Minecraft Movie,” but they also looked further down the road for 2025. In a nod to cinephiles, the studio kicked off its presentation by bringing out the stars of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” including Leonardo DiCaprio and Regina Hall. The film is set to hit theaters in September. “I’ve been wanting to work with Paul for over, gosh, almost 20 years now. He’s one of the most unique talents of our time,” DiCaprio said. “With this film, he’s tapped into something politically and culturally that is brewing beneath our psyche. But at the same time, it’s an incredibly epic movie and has such scope and scale.” Director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer also treated the audience to an extended sneak peak of “F1,” Brad Pitt’s Formula One racing drama premiering in June. In addition to Hollywood studios and stars boasting the theatrical menus they believe will lure audiences to cinemas, the annual convention is also a time to discuss current industry debates, like how long movies should stay in theaters and the extent to which studios should get into production with streaming companies. ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Lex Luthor."
Summer Movies: 11 breakout actors to watch,Summer Movies: 11 breakout actors to watch,https://apnews.com/article/summer-movies-2025-breakout-stars-c10ca7245748efdd6b7173aad61e9106,"Many of the big movies this summer might come from familiar places — whether they’re franchises, sequels or hybrid adaptations of beloved animated classics. But look closer and there are quite a few fresh faces making a splash with memorable characters new and old. The Associated Press spoke to 10 of the actors about the roles. Maia Kealoha was 6 years old when she saw an advertisement for an open casting call for the new hybrid “Lilo & Stitch” movie and promptly told her parents that’s what she wanted to do. Now 8, Kealoha, who was born on Hawaii’s Big Island, is making her film debut as the spirited Lilo in Disney’s new live-action adaptation, hitting theaters on May 23. “It was so amazing,” Kealoha said. “I was really proud of myself.” Sydney Elizebeth Agudong, who plays Lilo’s older sister and caregiver Nani, praised her young co-star. “It was amazing building a world with her,” Agudong, 24, said. “It’s a lot of CGI and we’re working with aliens and such and she was full of imagination and creativity.” Sydney Agudong, as Nani, in a scene from “Lilo & Stitch.” (Disney via AP) Hailing from Kaua’i, Agudong also came to the role from an open casting call. Being part of the film has been a special experience as a lifelong fan of the animated version and a proud Hawaii resident. “Hawaii’s very much like tough love and soft heart,” Agudong said. “We truly created a family and hopefully people can see that.” Happy Gilmore is a dad in the sequel coming to Netflix on July 25. The Gilmore boys, played by Ethan Cutkosky (“Shameless”), Conor Sherry (“Shake Shack”), Maxwell Jacob Friedman (a pro wrestler) and newcomer Philip Schneider, “are just goons,” Schneider said. All came to the project strangers, though intimately familiar with a film they’d all grown up with. And everyone but Friedman, 29, had to prove they had a little skill on the ice. “I looked like a goon so they just assumed I’d be fine on the rink,” Friedman laughed. This image released by Netflix shows, background from left, Philip Schneider as Bobby, Maxwell Friedman as Gordie, Ethan Cutkosky as Wayne, Conor Sherry as Terry and John Daly as John Daly in “Happy Gilmore 2.” (Scott Yamano/Netflix via AP) The four actors quickly found their rhythm together on set in Jersey City playing the rambunctious, troublemaking Gilmore spawn during the four-month shoot. “The fast pace of stupidity that we got to and what made us family was such an amazing thing,” Cutkosky, 25, said. “It’s really hard to come by.” Friedman added: “In between scenes, we could like look at each other and know what we were thinking and make each other laugh without talking.” Schneider, 24, attributed the atmosphere to their on-screen dad Adam Sandler, who made the whole set feel like a family. His genius, Schneider said, “is that he gets people he wants to work with and just sees what happens. He trusts the chemistry.” For Sherry, it was helpful so early in his career to get to see how Sandler could be both a giant in the industry and so humble. “That’s the dream, right? To balance both,” Sherry, 24, said. This image released by A24 shows Eva Victor in a scene from “Sorry, Baby.” (Mia Cioffy Henry/A24 via AP) One of the breakout films from Sundance was “Sorry, Baby,” a poignant drama that’s both funny and shattering about the aftermath of a traumatic event. It’s the feature debut of triple threat Eva Victor, who wrote, directed and stars as Agnes, a graduate student at a New England school. “I wanted to make a film that was about feeling stuck when everyone around you keeps moving that really didn’t center any violence,” said Victor, 31, who uses they/she pronouns. Victor, who had a recurring role on “Billions,” was making short comedy videos online and writing for the satirical website Reductress when Oscar-winning “Moonlight” filmmaker Barry Jenkins messaged them and asked if they had any scripts. Now, that script is going to be in theaters on June 27, through A24. “I hope the film finds people when they need it,” Victor said. This image released by Sony Pictures shows Ben Wang in a scene from “Karate Kid: Legends.” (Jonathan Wenk/Sony Pictures via AP) Ben Wang didn’t know he was up against some 10,000 people vying to play the new Karate Kid. The 25-year-old actor, best known for his role on the Disney+ series “American Born Chinese,” learned that after the fact. But it was a stressful month of not sleeping very well while waiting to hear if he got it, he said. “Karate Kid: Legends” (out May 30) brings together Jackie Chan’s Mr. Han and Ralph Macchio’s Daniel LaRusso for this new entry, about a teenager at a new school, Wang’s Li, who has to learn from both. “It’s a fun one to play,” Wang said. “And I get to try to kick Jackie Chan, which is new and exciting for me.” Nico Parker grew up with both the “How to Train Your Dragon” books and movies, so it was a dream come true when she got the chance to play Astrid in the new live-action adaptation (June 13). Mason Thames, left, and Nico Parker in a scene from “How to Train Your Dragon.”, (Universal Pictures via AP) “It’s a difficult thing when there’s already such a brilliant version of Astrid out there,” Parker, 20, said. “The main thing that I really wanted to be prevalent in everything was how driven she is and how it doesn’t come easy. It takes effort and skill and determination.” Parker, the daughter of actor Thandiwe Newton and director Ol Parker, has been on sets her whole life. She was only 11 when she filmed Tim Burton’s “Dumbo.” But this feels different, she said, because she really understands the scale and scope of being in a major franchise. “To be older I feel as if I’m acknowledging way more what it means and doesn’t mean,” she said. “And I get much more stressed about it.” This image released by Neon shows Benjamin Pajak in a scene from “The Life of Chuck.” (Neon via AP) You can’t blame filmmaker Mike Flanagan for assuming Benjamin Pajak was a skilled dancer. Pajak made his Broadway debut as Winthrop in “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster. But ask Pajak, now 14, and he demurs that dancing is not exactly his strong suit. But you would never guess that to see him waltzing and sambaing across the floor (thanks to Mandy Moore’s choreography) in “The Life of Chuck” (out June 6). “Film is so different from theater,” Pajak said. “But there were just so many people kind of lifting me up and helping me throughout the process.” One of those was Mark Hamill, who plays his grandfather. Perhaps even more exciting than being in the movies? Sharing scenes with Luke Skywalker. Krypto the dog, in a scene from “Superman.” (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP) Superman’s very good boy Krypto might be a computer-generated creation, but the inspiration was a very real dog: filmmaker James Gunn’s rescue Ozu. It was difficult transition to life in a home — Ozu destroyed shoes, furniture and even his laptop. Gunn, who was at work writing “Superman,” thought, “How difficult would it be if Ozu had superpowers?” That was how Krypto came to be part of the newest “Superman” (out July 11), changing the story and the script. The white pup features prominently in the film’s trailer. At the Puppy Bowl earlier this year, Gunn said that Krypto is lovable and mischievous and has all the powers of Superman — yes, he can fly too. ___ For more coverage of this summer’s upcoming films, visit https://apnews.com/hub/movies."
"Movie Review: ‘Thunderbolts’ is Marvel, and Florence Pugh, in high gear","Movie Review: ‘Thunderbolts’ is Marvel, and Florence Pugh, in high gear",https://apnews.com/article/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh-6617d8217ed6c96a364e10132ae98394,"As they so often do in Marvel Land, worlds collide in “Thunderbolts.” But in this refreshingly earthbound iteration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the collision isn’t a matter of interplanetary strife. “Thunderbolts” has been touted as the unlikely meeting of two of the dominant forces in 21st century American movies: Marvel and A24. This isn’t a co-production, but much of the creative team and many of the stars have ties to the indie studio. “Thunderbolts” is directed by Jake Schreier, who has directed many episodes of the A24 series “Beef,” and was written by Joanna Calo (also a “Beef” veteran) and Eric Pearson (a Marvel veteran). The connections go further: cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo (“A Ghost Story,” “The Green Knight”), editor Harry Yoon (“Minari”) and a score by the band Son Lux (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”). Some trailers for “Thunderbolts” have highlighted these connections, perhaps in hopes of a little A24 auteur cool rubbing off on Hollywood’s superhero factory. It’s also a sign of how rough things have gotten for Marvel that, after a string of misfires, it’s leaning on the studio behind “Swiss Army Man” for its latest would-be blockbuster. Does that make “Thunderbolts” a hipper superhero movie? Can you expect “Babygirl”-like scenes of Black Widow drinking a glass of milk? The answer, of course, is that “Thunderbolts” has no more indie cred than “Avatar.” What it is, though, is the best Marvel movie in years. “Thunderbolts,” about a group of MCU rejects who band together after CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine ( Julia Louis-Dreyfus ) tries to erase them and their covert program, is both a return to form for Marvel and something a little different. While there’s plenty of franchise building going on, “Thunderbolts” — the title of which bears an asterisk — is pleasantly stand-alone, and its spurts of spectacle more deftly proceed out of an tenderly told story. If there’s an influence on “Thunderbolts,” it’s less A24 than James Gunn. It borrows a little of the misfit irreverence of “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “The Suicide Squad.” But Schreier’s film is leaner and less antic than those movies, and it serves as an IMAX-sized platform for the increasingly obvious movie-star talents of Florence Pugh. In the opening moments of “Thunderbolts,” Pugh’s Yelena Belova, a veteran of the Soviet assassin Black Widow program, melancholily stands atop a skyscraper. “There’s something wrong with me,” she says. “An emptiness.” She drops, a parachute opens, and her narration continues. “Or maybe I’m just bored.” It’s a telling opening for a film that wrestles sometimes earnestly, sometimes a little glibly, with malaise and depression. Yelena is searching for meaning in her life, dragged down by guilt and shame from her past, a pain that even her relentlessly chipper father Alexei, the self-proclaimed Red Guardian (David Harbour, magnificent), can’t quell. When Yelena, on a mission, brutalizes a hallway full of armed guards — a shot that, as I critic, am contractually obligated to note is styled after the famous one from Park Chan-wook’s “Oldboy” — Schreier films it from overhead in a shadowy ballet. Shadows and death drape “Thunderbolts.” When Yelena is dispatched on what she says will be her last job, she’s surprised to encounter others like her — include the disgraced John Walker (Wyatt Russell) and the fight-mimicking Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) — sent to the same location. After some initial tussling, they realize they — like the protagonists of “Toy Story 3” — are standing inside of an incinerator. Adding to the confusion of their predicament is a guy with no apparent powers who simply introduces himself as “Bob” (Lewis Pullman, bringing a sensitivity rarely found in these movies). They aren’t quite a bizarro Avengers, but they — including Sebastian Stan’s Bucky Barnes, who joins later — are all the products of dubious government programs that instill less patriotism than their more plainly heroic counterparts. As a group, they’re plagued by doubt and uncertainty, and they’re more inclined to bicker than give rousing speeches. And whenever anyone brushes too closely with Bob, they drift back into the darkest chapters of their own pasts that pull them like a deadweight toward suicidal thoughts. Who, exactly, Bob turns out to be furthers this theme in “Thunderbolts,” which never feels like it’s lurching from one action set piece to another. That the final act of the movie is essentially set in a headspace, rather than above a threatened metropolis, is a testament to the interiority (not a word that often comes up in Marvel movies) of “Thunderbolts,” a film that finds vivid comic-book imagery to render authentic real-life emotions. That’s always been the promise of a good comic book, but it’s fair to say that the Marvel movies have recently found that tone elusive. When Louis-Dreyfus, looking just as home in Washington, D.C., as she was in “Veep,” as De Fontaine declares, “The Avengers are not walking through that door,” it’s an acknowledgment — like then-Celtics coach Rick Pitino once vowed of Larry Bird — that “Thunderbolts” is here to make the most of what it’s got. Of course, that there are, in fact, more “Avengers” films on the way slightly diminishes the sentiment. But they won’t be missed in “Thunderbolts.” All the assembled parts here, including an especially high-quality cast (even Wendell Pierce!) work together seamlessly in a way that Marvel hasn’t in some time. Most of all, Pugh commands every bit of the movie. It’s less a revelation than a big-budget confirmation of the screen power of an actor who also has gone from A24 (“Midsommar”) to Marvel stardom with ease. “Thunderbolts,” a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violence, language, thematic elements, and some suggestive and drug references. Running time: 126 minutes. Three stars out of four."
"Meet David Corenswet, cinema’s new Superman","Meet David Corenswet, cinema’s new Superman",https://apnews.com/article/superman-david-corenswet-summer-movie-preview-28021942374758920088a7e5891855e8,"In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record. David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his “pie in the sky ambition” was to play Superman. At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: “The Politician” and “Hollywood.” Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him. But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn’s “Superman” which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he’d manifested it into existence. “I said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,” Corenswet, 31, said. “I sort of was thinking of it as, ‘Oh, who wouldn’t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn’t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?’” Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West’s movie “Pearl.” In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl’s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too. “David was one of the very first auditions that I got,” Gunn said. “Instantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in ‘Pearl.’ He had a sense of humor. That made me go, ‘Ooh, this might be a really good match.’” That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was “extensive,” Corenswet said it was one of the most “satisfying audition processes” he’s ever gone through — not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer. Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him. “Superman is a square and David is a square,” Gunn said. “He listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That’s what he listens to on his iPad. That’s weird. But oh, so Superman.” When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn’t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course. “She texted, ‘Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?’” he said. “I said, ‘Yes. Super good news.’” It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor’s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve’s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill’s, which he called a “marvel of engineering.” But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was “wonderfully mundane.” The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he’d already started putting on weight for the role. “I remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,” Corenswet said. “We had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.” The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew. “I saw their faces sort of light up and I went, ‘Wait a minute, these people aren’t that fond of me,’” he laughed. “That’s when it hits you.” Gunn, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, and Corenswet at CinemaCon in April. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There’s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There’s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there’s Superman. “He’s a public facing character, he’s a symbol,” Corenswet said. “There’s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn’t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.” To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6’8” and 270 pounds, but is the “quietest, most wonderful man.” “That’s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,” Corenswet said. “He’s this big presence, but he’s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.” Gunn has promised that the film is “a personal journey for Superman that’s entirely new.” He’s a character who is “pretty damn good, but flawed.” And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane — but there’s even a different spin on that. “He’s in love with her,” Gunn said. “She’s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It’s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.” Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with “longing romance and witty comedy.” Fitting for their reporter characters, “His Girl Friday” was also a big reference with “the rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.” (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet’s profile immeasurably. He’s been in big movies before, including “Twisters.” But being Superman is different. “The thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,” he said. “I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.” Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point. “I expect some things will change when the film comes out,” he said. “But you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.” ___ For more on this year’s summer movie season, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/movies"
"Movie Review: ‘Rust’ is a serviceable Western, haunted throughout by its tragic offscreen history","Movie Review: ‘Rust’ is a serviceable Western, haunted throughout by its tragic offscreen history",https://apnews.com/article/rust-movie-review-alec-baldwin-shooting-289861a894b85b6e1c0ddf735da8942d,"Surely, bringing an audience to tears with a poignant ending is something every filmmaker dreams of. And yet the moment that inspires a genuine, unambiguous tear in “Rust” is born of a true nightmare. “...for Halyna,” the screen reads as the film comes to a close. Halyna Hutchins’ name also appears in Ukrainian. And we’re given a favored quote from the late cinematographer: “What can we do to make this better?” Just as there’s no way to make this film’s offscreen history any better, there’s no way to write a normal review of a movie that is anything but. “Rust” has inevitably and inexorably become synonymous with tragedy: Hutchins’ shocking death during an on-set rehearsal, when producer-star Alec Baldwin pointed a pistol at her that somehow contained a live round. It discharged, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. An involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin was dismissed. The movie’s weapons supervisor is serving an 18-month prison sentence. And eventually, the film was finished, with Souza returning and cinematographer Bianca Cline replacing Hutchins. Souza said at the film’s premiere in Poland that the family wanted Hutchins’ work to be seen. The movie’s terse publicity materials note that the original producers will not gain financially from it, and that although terms of a settlement were sealed, “it has been confirmed that (husband Matthew) Hutchins and son Andros will receive profits from the film.” In any case, the movie is here. It is not, as many surely expect, a uniformly shoddy effort. The plot is basic and the dialogue merely serviceable, but there are lovely scenery shots throughout, the vastness, gentle light and deep colors of the American West illustrated carefully and evocatively by Hutchins’ — and Cline’s — camera work. Yes, the cinematography is what stands out here. There are also several compelling performances, though Baldwin’s somewhat halting, somber turn is not among them. Most of all, though, there’s not a moment in “Rust” in which one loses awareness of the tragedy. While the scene we’ve all read about does not appear, there is constant gunfire, this being a Western. It’s hard to forget about a shooting while watching so much shooting. In fact, we begin with an accidental shooting. The unfortunate perpetrator is Lucas Hollister, a teenager in 1880s Wyoming who’s recently been orphaned, along with his little brother. We learn later that their father shot himself a year after their mother died. So Lucas (Patrick Scott McDermott, in an accomplished performance) has become the parent. On a trip into town, Lucas gets into a scuffle with another boy who’s insulting their late mother, hurting him. The rancher father demands that Lucas come work for him to pay off his debt. And when he comes to the desolate farm where the boys live to get him, Lucas accidentally shoots and kills him, while aiming at a wolf. A judge decides the crime was premeditated and sentences the boy to the gallows. His little brother comes each night to the prison to sleep next to him. Things look bleak — until a shadowy character with a white beard comes to break him out of the jailhouse, killing whoever gets in the way. “You tell any SOB who comes after me that he will shake hands with the devil himself,” says the mystery man. It’s Harlan Rust (Baldwin), a notorious outlaw who hasn’t been seen for years. He is also Lucas’ estranged grandfather, having been alerted to the boy’s plight by his sister (Frances Fisher, excellent). Thus begins the great chase. Rust and Lucas flee towards Mexico, the only place they can be safe. On their tail are a plethora of pursuers: Sheriff Wood Helm (Josh Hopkins) and various bounty hunters, chief among them the brutal Fenton “Preacher” Lang (Travis Fimmel, appropriately fearsome). The two don’t get along at first — they never do, in such stories — and Lucas aches to get back to his brother. But Rust convinces him it’s better to stay alive. Eventually, luck runs out for the pair, and someone will have to pay. But for its unique circumstances, one can imagine “Rust” coming and going without much of a ripple. The question now is, who is going to be seeing this movie? Certainly many people will come — or watch at home — out of morbid curiosity. What they will find is a movie better in some aspects — especially, and poignantly, the cinematography — than they may have suspected. But it is one that will always be defined, and reflected in every frame, by its tragic history. And there’s no real way to make that better. “Rust,” a Falling Forward release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 139 minutes. One and half stars out of four."
Movie Review: Thriller ‘The Surfer’ brings Nicolas Cage to a boil,Movie Review: Thriller ‘The Surfer’ brings Nicolas Cage to a boil,https://apnews.com/article/surfer-review-nicolas-cage-311b8242c24b50ba6189de63cdfdaa10,"For a long, sun-addled stretch, Lorcan Finnegan’s beach-set “The Surfer” simmers as a deliciously punishing nightmare, driving Nicolas Cage into his most natural state: a boil. “Don’t live here, don’t surf here,” is the slogan at a pristine stretch of beach along Luna Bay on the Australian coast where our unnamed protagonist (Cage) has come to surf with his teenage son (Finn Little). The “locals only” signs, though, don’t deter him. He was born there, and has come back to surf the break and show his son the million-dollar house on the hills nearby he plans to buy. But the situation rapidly disintegrates. He’s roughed up by the pushy local surfers, his son takes off, and one issue after another keeps him stuck there on a hillside overlooking the ocean. Anyone who comes to “The Surfer” expecting glamorous photography of perfectly tubular waves will be disappointed. This is a movie that gets a remarkable amount of mileage out of a parking lot. It also belongs to that small niche of films where things get so unbearably terrible for the protagonist that the psychodrama becomes more a matter of endurance than pure entertainment. I’m thinking of movies like “U-turn” or “Affliction” — films where a character’s inability to reckon with their reality spirals miserably. As time wears on, Cage’s character gets bloodied, sunburned and incredibly thirsty, and the film grows hallucinatory and surreal. There are snakes, rats and bird eggs. The Lexus he arrives in is towed. His suit gets dusty and ripped. Small nuisances — a dead cellphone battery — accumulate. The sun seems to be melting his brain, so much so that he’s no longer sure of who he is, and we start to doubt what’s real, too. What’s happening here? The Surfer, as he’s credited, is hell-bent on reclaiming something. He envisions reuniting with his family at the new house, but his separated wife, on the phone, tells him she wants a divorce. Is “The Surfer,” penned by Thomas Martin, a metaphor for knowing when to cut bait? Cage’s character won’t accept his loses, and so he ultimately comes to risk much more. When Finnegan begins to answer these questions in a third act that brings us closer to the surfer bros on the beach, “The Surfer” becomes more tolerable to watch and yet less transfixing. The beach gang, led by a man named Scally (Julian McMahon), are something of a cult for reviving an old-fashioned idea of masculinity. With this turn, the strong undertow of “The Surfer” dissipates. But if there was ever an actor to elevate pulpy, not-fully formed genre material, it’s Cage. His performance of a man brought to near-disintegration can be neatly filed alongside Cage’s many other head trips to the brink. All he needs is a bluff above a beach to make “The Surfer” churn with the currents of a man tenuously close to being swept out to sea. “The Surfer,” a Roadside Attractions release that’s in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language, suicide, some violence, drug content and sexual material. Running time: 103 minutes. Three stars out of four."
Movie Review: ‘April’ is shattering and essential,Movie Review: ‘April’ is shattering and essential,https://apnews.com/article/april-review-dea-kulumbegashvili-c33455c1989893afe678f8cc6d5edfec,"Whatever cruelness you might assign to the month, Dea Kulumbegashvili’s “April” probably has it beat. Kulumbegashvili’s shattering, sensational film is set in a hardscrabble, provincial region of Georgia, the Eastern European country. Nina (Ia Sukhitashvili) is the leading obstetrician at the local hospital and she leads a punishing life. In the film’s opening scenes, she delivers a baby — Kulumbegashvili films it from overhead — who doesn’t cry once born. Sterile hallways and men demanding answers follow the stillbirth and the fleshy, bloody images of the operating room. Though Nina has done thousands of deliveries, the father calls for a police investigation. Left alone with Nina, he tells her he knows she gives abortions in the village. He calls her a murderer and spits on her. Nina experiences the moment with horror and silence, a pervading register in “April.” Kulumbegashvil’s film is formally composed and rigorously opaque, but it churns with an underlying, aching despair. Abortion — legal but fraught in Georgia — is central to “April.” But Nina’s predicament and loneliness stem from something even deeper. Again and again, “April” places its solitary female protagonist in scenes where every gesture — professional or intimate — is treated as lesser, an imbalance that’s violently and brutally impressed upon Nina. In “April,” where Nina traverses a harsh, isolating landscape, the most resonate, disquieting sounds are the soft, sad murmurs of the deaf-mute teen (Roza Kancheishvili) for whom Nina performs a kitchen table abortion. It’s a procedure, shot statically from the side with only half of her visible, necessitated by a mysterious rape. The girl’s mother has no answers. In “April,” even howls of pain go unuttered, and only the storm cloud skies cry. “April” confirms Kulumbegashvili as among the most essential and uncompromising European filmmakers, extending the promise of her 2020 debut “Beginning,” about the wife of a Jehovah’s Witness leader. A prize-winner at last fall’s Venice Film Festival, “April” could be accused of leaning too much into an austere, art-film obliqueness. But Kulumbegashvili’s absolute control over the camera and the intensity of her calling make her film a grimly spellbinding and unforgettable experience. Nina says little through the course of “April,” but when she does, it’s powerful. Being on the front lines of treating women in a place where their freedom is so restricted has brought Nina closer to desperation. When the investigation proceeds, she flatly tells her boss, “Other than my job, I have nothing to lose.” Sukhitashvili’s deft performance is most expressive in her yearning eyes. Cinematographer Arseni Khachaturan, trading objective and subjective perspectives, toggles between images of Nina alone — driving at night, looking for a sexual partner — or crowded by men. When she explains the stillbirth circumstances, we see her view: three men, sitting in judgment. Mixed throughout are separate, unexplained scenes of a faceless, humanlike figure with drooping, unformed bags of skin. We see her slowly shifting from one foot to the other, and hear her breathing heavily. Who is this? Is it a malformed expression of Nina’s tortured soul? Is it some adult fetus whose plight, in contrast to the unborn, has no sympathizers?

"Movie Review: A tactile, retro-coded fantasy in ‘The Legend of Ochi’","Movie Review: A tactile, retro-coded fantasy in ‘The Legend of Ochi’",https://apnews.com/article/legend-of-ochi-movie-review-aa4ee5a43fa992e9a05d375a3d73b90e,"“The Legend of Ochi,” a scrappy and darkly whimsical fable about a misunderstood teenage girl on a dangerous quest, has the feeling of a film you might have stumbled on and loved as a kid. Something tactile, something fantastical and, maybe, something a little dangerous — the kind of movie you knew you probably weren’t supposed to be seeing just yet. They’re the ones that tend to linger, like that strange English dub of the Norwegian adventure “Shipwrecked” that I once saw on the Disney Channel at an impressionable age. Perhaps this is something familiar only to those first home video generations, from a naive, pre-social media era when the movies that you loved felt like your own personal discovery and secret, no matter if it was “Star Wars” or “The NeverEnding Story.” How disappointing it was to learn later that everyone else loved them too. It’s no surprise that “The Legend of Ochi” was made by someone (Isaiah Saxon) in this zone — an older millennial shaped by some combination of “E.T.”, “The Black Stallion” and the Palm Pictures’ Directors Label box set. Those DVDs taught many a cinephile about the transportive possibilities of music videos dreamt up by Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry for artists like Aphex Twin, Daft Punk and Björk (for whom Saxon would direct the “Wanderlust” video). That music video energy and committed world building is evident in “Ochi,” in a positive way. It’s a description that seems to be used more pejoratively than not, like shallowly dismissing something pretty as a perfume commercial. But perhaps those people just haven’t seen the good ones. Helena Zengel ( “News of the World” ) is the central heroine, Yuri, who lives with her father Maxim (Willem Dafoe) and a de-facto brother Petro (Finn Wolfhard) on the woodsy, old-world island of Carpathia. Maxim loves to hunt the Ochi, a species of primates that are constantly threatening the safety of the humans and their farms, and he’s trained an army of young boys to help. Yuri is largely kept off to the side, partly for her protection, partly, probably, because Maxim is a blustery alpha male who dresses up in elaborate, ancient armor for his missions. Her armor is a dirty, oversized yellow puffer jacket that could double as a sleeping bag. At home, she stews silently and listens to death metal in her room. She’s a bit feral, which would be a cliche trope for a girl raised without a mother, but Zengel makes it work. It’s clear she doesn’t feel at home in this world, but finds a kind of purpose when she comes across an injured baby Ochi and takes it upon herself to return it to its family. The Ochi, she quickly realizes, have been misunderstood too. It’s still a dangerous journey, which involves a humorous and slightly disgusting visit to a local supermarket, the discovery of her own long-lost mother (Emily Watson, who promptly helps Yuri brush her hair out of her eyes), and a comical, intense showdown between Watson and Dafoe. David Longstreth, of the Dirty Projectors, did the fanciful score and Evan Prosofsky is responsible for the vivid cinematography. “The Legend of Ochi” was forged out of many influences, from Miyazaki to Amblin, and it’s the kind of ambitious swing that Hollywood doesn’t seem to take very often these days — especially not with a PG rating. That doesn’t mean it all works seamlessly, though. The emotional beats don’t seem to land as authentically as the more irreverent humor. But it’s impossible not to admire the creativity, the imagination and the care that went into making something like this, with puppetry, matte paintings and inventive graphics, for a mere $10 million. “The Legend of Ochi,” an A24 release in theaters nationwide Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for “some language, smoking, a bloody image, thematic elements and violent content.” Running time: 96 minutes. Three stars out of four."
Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. Here’s what we know,Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. Here’s what we know,https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-foreign-movies-films-8008248fc08c748a7e8a174306ba66ba,"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump is eyeing Hollywood for his next round of tariffs, threatening to levy all films produced outside the U.S. at a steep rate of 100%. Over the weekend, Trump accused other countries of “stealing the movie-making capabilities” of the U.S. and said that he had authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to immediately begin the process of implementing this new import tax on all foreign-made films. But further specifics or dates weren’t provided. And the White House confirmed that no final decisions had been made as of Monday. Trump later said that he would meet with industry executives about the proposal but a lot remains unclear about how an import tax on complex, international productions could even be implemented. If imposed, experts warn that such a tariff would dramatically hike the costs of making movies today. That uncertainty could put filmmakers in limbo, much like other industries that have recently been caught in the crosshairs of today’s ongoing trade wars. Unlike other sectors that have recently been targeted by tariffs, however, movies go beyond physical goods, bringing larger intellectual property ramifications into question. Here’s what we know. Trump is citing national security concerns, a justification he’s similarly used to impose import taxes on certain countries and a range of sector-specific goods. In a Sunday night post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump claimed that the American movie industry is “DYING to a very fast death” as other countries offer “all sorts of incentives” to draw filmmaking away from the U.S. Trump has previously voiced concern about movie production moving overseas. And in recent years, U.S. film and television production has been hampered between setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Incentive programs have also long-influenced where movies are shot both abroad and within the U.S., with more production leaving California to states like Georgia and New Mexico -- as well as countries like Canada. But unlike other sectors targeted by Trump’s recently-imposed tariffs, the American film industry currently holds a trade deficit that’s in the U.S.'s favor. In movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace. Data from the Motion Picture Association also shows that American films made $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023 — with a recent report noting that these films “generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the world” for the U.S. Last year, international markets accounted for over 70% of Hollywood’s total box office revenue, notes Heeyon Kim, an assistant professor of strategy at Cornell University. She warns that tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries impacting this industry could result in billions of dollars in lost earnings and thousands of jobs. “To me, (this) makes just no sense,” she said, adding that such tariffs could “undermine otherwise a thriving part of the U.S. economy.” The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers across the U.S. and Canada, said in a statement Monday that Trump had “correctly recognized” the “urgent threat from international competition” that the American film and television industry faces today. But the union said it instead recommended the administration implement a federal production tax incentive and other provisions to “level the playing field” while not harming the industry overall. That’s anyone’s guess. “Traditional tariffs apply to physical imports crossing borders, but film production primarily involves digital services — shooting, editing and post-production work that happens electronically,” notes Ann Koppuzha, a lawyer and business law lecturer at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. Koppuzha said that film production is more like an applied service that can be taxed, not tariffed. But taxes require Congressional approval, which could be a challenge even with a Republican majority. Making a movie is also an incredibly complex — and international — process. It’s common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” for instance, are shot around the world. U.S. studios frequently shoot abroad because tax incentives can aid production costs. But a blanket tariff across the board could discourage that or limit options, Kim said — hurting both Hollywood films and the global industry that helps create them. “When you make these sort of blanket rules, you’re missing some of the nuance of how production works,” added Steven Schiffman, a longtime industry veteran and adjunct professor at Georgetown University. “Sometimes you just need to go to the location, because frankly it’s way too expensive just to try to create in a soundstage” Schiffman points to popular titles filmed outside the U.S. — such as Warner Bros’ “Harry Potter” series, which was almost entirely shot in the U.K. “The cost to have done that would have like literally double to produce those movies under this proposed tariff,” he said. Overall, experts warn that the prospect of tariffing foreign-made movies ventures into uncharted waters. “There’s simply no precedent or sense for applying tariffs to these types of creative services,” Koppuzha said. And while the Trump administration could extend similar threats to other forms of intellectual property, like music, “they’d encounter the same practical hurdles.” But if successful, some also warn of potential retaliation. Kim points to “quotas” that some countries have had to help boost their domestic films by ensuring they get a portion of theater screens, for example. Many have reduced or suspended such quotas over the years in the name of open trade — but if the U.S. places a sweeping tariff on all foreign-made films, these kinds of quotas could come back, “which would hurt Hollywood film or any of the U.S.-made intellectual property,” Kim said. And while U.S. dominance in film means “there are fewer substitutes” for retaliation, Schiffman notes that other forms of entertainment — like game development — could see related impacts down the road. Others stress the potential consequences of hampering international collaboration overall. “Creative content distribution requires thoughtful economic approaches that recognize how modern storytelling flows across borders,” notes Frank Albarella, U.S. media and telecommunications sector leader at KPMG. “The question hanging over every screen: Might we better nurture American storytelling through smart, targeted incentives, or could we inadvertently force audiences to pay more for what could become a narrower creative landscape?” __________ AP Writers Jake Coyle and Jill Colvin in New York, Aamer Madhani in Palm Beach, Florida and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report."
US and China to start talks over trade war this week,US and China to start talks over trade war this week,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgrejkvmjo,"US and Chinese officials are set to start talks this week to try to deescalate a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. Mr Bessent said he looked forward to rebalancing the international economic system to better serve the interests of the US. ""My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,"" he said in an interview with Fox News. ""If the United States wants to resolve the issue through negotiations, it must face up to the serious negative impact of unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world,"" a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday morning. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. The report added that China is open to talks but reiterated that if the country decides to continue to fight this trade war – it will fight to the end. The trade war has triggered turmoil in financial markets and sent shockwaves across global trade. Two trade experts told the BBC that they were not particularly optimistic about the talks, at least in the initial phase. ""You have to start somewhere, so I'm not saying it isn't worthwhile. Just unlikely to be the launch event people are hoping to see,"" said Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation. ""We should expect to see a lot of back and forth, just like what happened last time in 2018,"" Henry Gao, Professor of Law at Singapore Management University and a former Chinese lawyer on the World Trade Organization secretariat said. ""I would expect the talks to drag on for several months or even more than a year"". Financial markets in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news as well as announcements by Chinese authorities of measures to support the economy. US stock futures were also higher. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date and are an indication of how markets will trade when they open. Investors are also waiting for the US central bank to make its latest announcement on interest rates on Wednesday afternoon.

UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks,UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y6y90e5vzo,"The UK and India have agreed a trade deal that will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The British government said the ""landmark"" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and ""deliver for British people and business"". Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled £42.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was ""ambitious and mutually beneficial"". The pact would help ""catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies"", he said in a post on social media platform X. Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said. That includes lower tariffs on: The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: The British government said the deal was the ""biggest and most economically significant"" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were ""massive"". "
Analysis: UK-India deal secured as Trump tariffs everywhere,Faisal Islam: Trump tariffs may have helped drive UK-India trade deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn919g2v3w2o,"It has long been the great prize for Britain's post-EU trade freedom - a deal with what is now the world's most populous country. India has agreed its most generous free trade agreement with the UK, which is at the same time Britain's biggest post-Brexit trade deal. It means a big boost for key UK exports such as whisky and cars which will see very high tariffs or taxes on imports slashed. This is not a normal deal taking two way trade down to zero tariffs. India is a highly protectionist economy. So, while 99% of tariffs on India's exports to the UK will be eradicated, 85% of British exports will not be tariffed going to India. But because British exports are so much higher value than Indian exports of clothing, footwear, and food, this should be worth £15bn extra for British exports and £10bn for India by 2040. This could change, though. For example, 88,000 cheaper Indian cars will now be able to be imported tariff free. The UK government sees this as a win-win which helps exporters, creates jobs, and means lower prices for consumers. This is all part of, in Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds words, making the UK the ""most connected market in the world"" - with a Brexit reset, a deal with the US, ""pragmatism"" on China, and new deals with India, and soon the Gulf. But there is also a much bigger picture here. This is the worlds fifth and sixth biggest economies doing a much closer deal to increase trade at a time when the top two - the US and China - are involved in a brutal trade war, and the Trump administration is tariffing everywhere. This may be one of the reasons why this elusive deal, coveted by many previous governments, has finally got over the line. It also turns the page on decades of missed economic opportunities, given the strong historic connections between the two nations."
EU plans to end Russian gas imports by end of 2027,EU plans to end Russian gas imports by end of 2027,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04547pr9vqo,"The European Commission has published a ""roadmap"" outlining its plans to end Europe's reliance on Russian energy in the coming years. Under the plans, imports of all Russian gas and liquefied natural gas to European Union member states will be banned by the end of 2027. ""No more will we permit Russia to weaponise energy against us... No more will we indirectly help fill up the [Kremlin's] war chests,"" European Commissioner for Energy Dan Jorgensen said in a news conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday. In response to the plans, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday that Europe was ""shooting itself in the foot"". The EU vowed to end its energy relations with Russia after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. A set of legislative proposals will be tabled in June asking all EU member states to make ""national plans"" to phase out Russian gas, nuclear fuel and oil imports, according to the European Commission. EU member states must submit strategies under the plans for replacing Russian oil imports by the end of 2027. Countries have also been asked to outline strategies for ending their reliance on Russia for uranium, enriched uranium and other nuclear materials. The EU hopes to move away from Russian gas by ""enhancing energy efficiency, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and diversifying supplies"", the European Commission said. While EU dependence on Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuels has decreased significantly since Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the bloc still imports a significant quantity of its energy from Russia. According to the report, EU gas imports from Russia have decreased from 45% in 2021 to 19% in 2024. The share of Russian oil imports has also shrunk from 27% at the beginning of 2022 to 3% now. Work must be done to reduce the bloc's reliance on Russian nuclear supplies, products and services, the report said, with more than 14% of uranium in the EU sourced from Russia in 2024. The EU's reliance on Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel poses ""risks to our economic security"" and financially supports Russia's war economy, the report said. ""We've come far, but not far enough,"" Jorgensen added in Tuesday's news conference, adding that measures to phase out Russian energy would be ""stepwise and gradual"" to minimise the impact on the EU. The roadmap also includes plans to target Russia's use of ""shadow fleets"" – oil tankers ""with obscure ownership and insurance"" that Russia uses to maintain its oil exports and bypass sanctions."
UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash in £2.9bn deal,UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash in £2.9bn deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yr1nz7jwko,"Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at £2.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. ""The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce,"" the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was ""very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business"". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was ""transformative"". ""The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition."" The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about £172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about £2bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some £8bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to ""squeeze out"" rivals such as Just Eat and ""rattle Uber"" in the UK. ""The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top,"" he added. ""With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast."""
Car giant Ford and Barbie maker Mattel warn over tariffs costs,Car giant Ford and Barbie maker Mattel warn over tariffs costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1e7ll07do,"Barbie maker Mattel says it will put up the prices of some of its toys in the US as President Donald Trump's tariffs increase its costs. The firm also says it will cut the number of products it makes in China for the American market. At the same time, car making giant Ford says the levies will cost it about $1.5bn (£1.13bn) this year. They join a growing list of big businesses warning about the impact of US tariffs on their companies and the wider economy. ""Given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving US tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending, and Mattel's US sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season,"" Mattel said as it updated investors on its financial performance. The US accounts for about half of Mattel's global toy sales. It imports around 20% of its goods sold there from China. The company said it plans to reduce those Chinese imports to the US to below 15% by next year. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed new import taxes of up to 145% on goods from China. His administration said last month that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US. Apart from China, Mattel imports products – including Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars – from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The three countries were also hit with steep tariffs by Trump in April, before they were paused for 90 days. Last week, Trump acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs. American children might ""have two dolls instead of 30 dolls"", he said, but added that China would suffer more than the US. Carmaker Ford said it expected tariffs to add $2.5bn to its overall costs this year, mainly due to the increased expense of Mexican and Chinese imports. But the firm said it had cut about $1bn of those added costs by taking various measures, including transporting vehicles from Mexico to Canada to avoid US tariffs. The firm also suspended its annual earnings guidance to investors because of uncertainty around Trump's trade policies. In April, firms including technology giant Intel, footwear makers Adidas and Skechers, and consumer goods group Procter & Gamble detailed the impact of tariffs on their businesses. ""The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing,"" Intel's chief financial officer David Zinsner said during a call with investors. Sportswear giant Adidas warned tariffs would lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers, including the Gazelle and the Samba. The finance chief of footwear firm Skechers, David Weinberg, told investors: ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success."" And Procter & Gamble – which makes Ariel laundry detergent, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Gillette shaving products – said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places."
India worried about Chinese 'dumping' as trade tensions with Trump escalate,India worried about Chinese 'dumping' as trade tensions with Trump escalate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg5d505v8xo,"The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down. The viscose yarn – a popular material that goes into making woven garments – he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month. That's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; £0.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports. With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets. India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs. While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps. Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition. ""We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,"" he says. Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are ""slowing production"". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed. China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers. ""We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,"" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper. But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals. While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India. Their sudden inflow will prove ""very disruptive"" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year. In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India. India, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (£75bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells. In response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn. India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down. Despite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. That's because the government has only had ""limited success"" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. While western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit. India's burgeoning deficit is a ""worrying story"", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters. ""This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,"" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. ""We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap."" India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura. Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being ""swamped by China"", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US. China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, ""It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny"". Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.

Colombia's wind farms bring promise and pain for indigenous group,Colombia's wind farms bring promise and pain for indigenous group,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2ekjjgldo,"When José Luis Iguarán steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea. The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguarán belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing. With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature. ""You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,"" Mr Iguarán says. His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more. ""At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,"" Mr Iguarán adds. The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family. Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguarán says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones. Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions. Mr Iguarán believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. ""The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,"" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela. His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption. ""Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,"" he adds. These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits. ""There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,"" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu. ""In Colombia… there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable."" In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renováveis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable. One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113. EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to ""constant protests"" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023. Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard. And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms. ""We call it the 'wind wars',"" says Ms Barney. For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies. ""There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,"" he says. This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects. ""For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected."" By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs. While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix. For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect. One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms. The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits. But it says good community relations are not enough. ""We cannot do these projects alone,"" says Federico Echavarría, general manager of AES Colombia. ""The government must help resolve conflicts between communities."" On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state. Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water. Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jagüeys – reservoirs filled with rainwater. His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit. Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. ""The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,"" he laments. The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term. While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."
Deported gang members get second chance at call centre,Deported gang members get second chance at call centre,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g2e332d9o,"When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby. Born in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old. Growing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life. After his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth. ""It was a shock. It still is,"" he admits. ""When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing."" Alberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. ""Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],"" he reflects. In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company – EZ Call Center – was looking for English-speakers. The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved. ""I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,"" he tells me during a break between calls. Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz. He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico. ""We are all dealing with culture shock,"" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls. ""We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too."" In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing. All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US. Daniel says that agents like Alberto – who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico – are among his most trusted employees. ""They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,"" he explains. Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions. As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation – called the Borderline Crisis Center – which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico. After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls ""the largest deportation in American history"". He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California. Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees. So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing. The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024. However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant ""encounters"" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years. The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors – from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador – may have acted as an effective deterrent. The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings. Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city. The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality. Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce. With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys. ""What happened in the US stays in the US,"" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. ""We don't really do background checks on that."" Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate. ""We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,"" she explains. The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start. He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old. ""Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,"" Luis explains. While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech. Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life. ""I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends."" For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with. ""From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,"" he adds. While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months. If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes. In Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line."
The ex-Google exec who wants to simplify your life,Why Marissa Mayer wants you to spend less time tapping your phone screen,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20250313-the-ex-google-exec-who-wants-to-simplify-your-life,"The former Google and Yahoo executive believes AI should simplify our lives but warns the real battle for the future will be determined by how the US and China embrace this technology. Marissa Mayer has spent her career at the centre of some of Silicon Valley's biggest moments. She was among Google's earliest employees and its first female engineer, helping to shape the search engine's user experience. She played a key role in many of the company's other now well-known products including maps and Gmail during her 13 years there. Later she would spend five-years as Yahoo's CEO and president, leading the company during a particularly challenging period. Throughout her career, Mayer has always been drawn to the intersection of technology and consumer experience. Recently, she's been tackling a new challenge at Sunshine, her AI-driven startup focused on making everyday tasks more seamless, starting with managing users' phone contacts and reminding them about birthdays. The company's latest AI-powered photo sharing app reflects Mayer's broader vision for how technology can enhance personal connections and interactions. ""I'm a techno-optimist,"" Mayer tells the BBC. ""I believe that AI, when applied thoughtfully, can free up time, strengthen relationships and ultimately bring more joy."" Over the years, Mayer has served on the boards of companies including Walmart and AT&T while also backing startups such as Minted and Square. In 2018, a year after resigning from Yahoo following the sale of its operating business to Verizon for $4.48bn (£3.6bn), Mayer co-founded Lumi Labs with former colleague Enrique Muñoz Torres, with the ambition of bringing AI to everyday consumer tasks. The company rebranded in 2020 as Sunshine after unveiling its first product, Sunshine Contacts, which aimed to use AI to rearrange smartphone users' contacts, delete duplicates and keep information up-to-date. Later it would launch Sunshine Birthdays, which promised to help avoid missing someone's birthday ever again by reminding users and allowing them to order gifts or cards within the app. The company has since pivoted to Shine: Photo Messaging, a free AI-powered app that claims to help users organise and share photos with facial recognition and automation. It's focused on recognising friends in photos and understanding who was together – whether for a BBQ, wedding or baseball game – by using contacts, location data and facial recognition to cluster images and automatically share them without the usual hassle. Still, like many AI-driven platforms, particularly those using facial recognition, the concept raises questions about data privacy and storage. (The company's website says it puts privacy first by requiring user consent before sharing photos but does store data and disclose certain information to third parties but does not sell it). Although she sees AI's potential to make people's lives easier, Mayer acknowledges there are challenges ahead, particularly when it comes to regulation, consumer trust, and ethical oversight of this emerging technology. Mayer spoke to the BBC about her vision for Sunshine, the evolving role of AI in daily life and what keeps her up at night. After spending years running Yahoo and parts of Google, how did you decide what you wanted to do next? I always wanted to be an entrepreneur and try founding something. I've always thought about how technology can bring people closer together and give people more time back. There were lots of things I loved about Google Search for the decade that I ran it, and one was giving people information and their time back because search was better, faster and more efficient. When I founded Sunshine, I really wanted to think about how we could make people's relationships stronger, and how people could spend less time on the screen tapping on things, and more time with each other doing things that are of higher value. What do you make of big tech's close relationship with President Donald Trump's administration? I'm by no means a political expert. So, I think that's an area I'm really remiss to comment on. I know overall I respect a lot of the players who are in the space and in that political dialogue on both sides. But I think it's really hard to say… particularly in the tech space where things are moving so quickly. Are you concerned about tariffs on trade and imports impacting your company? For example, a memo signed by President Donald Trump recently promised to impose tariffs on digital services from countries that placed burdensome regulations on US technology companies. I think eventually it may touch the company, but right now we're very focused on the US and English-speaking markets – and it's all digital goods. At the moment, I think the tariffs are unlikely to affect us. You've long been one of the more prominent female leaders in tech. How do you view the progress made for women in the industry? What are some of the biggest remaining challenges there? A lot has happened over the past 25 years of my career. I've been lucky to have been at places that are very empowering to women. That was true both at Google and Yahoo and it certainly is at Sunshine. It's also been true in my board work within those companies. I would like to see more women entering tech. It involves acquiring talent and retaining talent by having the right environment where they can be promoted and thrive. One of the things we identified early at Google was that, yes, there needs to be more women, but you also need to have an environment with men who are good at working with women. It's about selecting for an accepting environment. Silicon Valley has long been associated with a ""tech bro"" culture. How have you seen the culture evolve over time? At Google, we were so focused… that gender really did fade into the background. I didn't think about the fact that I was one of a few technical women there. In my leadership team at Yahoo, we had more than half women. Here at Sunshine, more than half of our engineers are women. I've always been in playing fields where I think women have been really respected and very much on equal footing, even if we weren't at equal numbers. From that perspective, I didn't necessarily have a hard time because I started my career at Google and was there for the first 13 years. A lot of strong women came out of that culture… including Jen Fitzpatrick [senior VP of core systems and experiences], who's very senior there now, and Sheryl Sandberg [former chief operating officer at Meta]. What did you learn during your time at Yahoo and Google that you're bringing over to Sunshine? So many things. I will say that focus on the product and a great user experience at the center of the design and development process has been part of all the companies I've been involved with. It's a very centering force. It's what really drives our ambition… and turns out superior technologies. You joined Yahoo at a time when it faced challenges in innovation and competition. What do you believe was your greatest accomplishment there? On the product side, I came to Yahoo to bring the company into the mobile era. When I arrived, we basically had no mobile products… and less than 30 global engineers in the company of 18,000. In fairness to Yahoo, it was 2012. I had really sold the board on the idea that much of what Yahoo had in its arsenal was stock, sports scores, news, weather, email and things that could thrive on the phone. But to do that, we had to build a mobile team. The first half of my time there – two and a half years – we had 600 mobile engineers. Apple identified us as the biggest iOS shop in the world. We won back-to-back app of the year awards – when Apple was only giving one a year – for Yahoo weather and Yahoo user Digest. We transformed that product suite and really brought it into the mobile era and ultimately started generating almost $2bn (£1.6bn). And part of that was the growth of mobile. So I'm really proud of what we accomplished in terms of the product offering and making it mobile first. How does Shine differentiate itself in a marketplace crowded with photo sharing services? For the first few years at Sunshine, we worked on contacts and built what I believe is a best-of-breed contacts app. We are really overall excited about it, but it is not viral. No one walks around saying, oh my gosh, my contact manager is so great. So this past year, we've pivoted and gone to something in the space that everyone else is more passionate about, and that's photos and events. But it's the same idea… how do you apply AI to everyday tasks? How can these technologies bring people closer together and give them time back? Tell us how Shine does that for photos. Right now, we're really focused on how we can help people share photos more efficiently by recognising your friends in photos and making it easier to share in small groups. If you're just going to share a photo person-to-person, you can text. If you want to share it with hundreds of people, there's always Instagram and Threads. But if you actually want to take a whole set of photos from [an experience] and then share it with anywhere from five to a few hundred people, that almost certainly involves cross-platforms between iOS and Android, which means neither Google Photos nor Apple Photos is really often the right solution for that group. It's often so much trouble that people just don't share the photos at all. So it's taking things like facial recognition, an understanding of your contacts and location and really trying to put together a whole picture of: who is this group, why were they together, and how would they want to share that photo. As an AI startup, do you worry about AI regulations? Partnerships between the government and thought leaders on both sides, both pessimists and optimists, are going to be absolutely critical. Even experts and people who are trying to stay apprised of everything, and really understand where things are and where they're going, have blind spots. It's very hard right now to keep up. I worry that sometimes we [in the US] get into a mindset that's very isolationist, thinking just about the US or the West. We don't necessarily think about the fact that there are a lot of AI technologies being developed elsewhere – in China in particular. They may have very different value systems than what we have. If we pump the brakes too hard with regulation and regulate this innovation, I don't think that same slowing will happen there. I think DeepSeek makes the point more obvious now. The real competition in terms of how AI is developed and adopted is between the US and China, not between any two companies. Inherent to the US-China AI competition is a tension between the common good and individual liberties, particularly in terms of how the AI is used. Which country is the leader in the AI space will fundamentally impact our global future. This isn't necessarily a values-based statement about which is better, but it raises questions like whether AI should prioritise public safety through large-scale surveillance or uphold strict privacy protections even at the risk of reduced oversight. Where do you think we'll be with AI in the next year or even five to 10 years? I'm incredibly optimistic about AI. I hope that it touches most of what we do. There's an adage that people tend to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term, and that's true generally in technology. I remember being five and watching the Jetsons and being like, wow, when I'm 30 they'll be flying cars. I'll be almost 50... and we're well past that mark and nowhere close to a safe flying car yet, but they are getting closer all the time. At the same time, when I was five, the internet didn't even exist. It has really transformed everything in terms of how we work, learn and navigate the world. AI is moving very fast. I wonder if this is going to be one of the first technologies that breaks that adage where it actually might surpass our expectations in the near term. I certainly think it's going to surpass our expectations in the longer term in terms of what it can do and what can happen. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."
Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms,Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp22d2kexo,"The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called ""Edinburgh Reforms"", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had ""no immediate"" plans to move, he and his company ""got a very warm welcome"" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract."
Trump considering 100% tariffs on movies not made in the US,Trump considering 100% tariffs on movies not made in the US,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7e2z1rxyo,"Donald Trump says he will talk to Hollywood executives, after his earlier announcement to hit films made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs sent shockwaves through the industry. The US president said on Sunday he was authorising the commerce department to start the process to impose the levy because America's film industry was dying ""a very fast death"". But he appeared to soften his stance later on Monday, telling reporters at the White House he was going to ""meet with the industry"" to ""make sure they're happy"" with his proposal. For years, filmmakers have been leaving Hollywood for destinations including the UK and Canada to lower costs. One non-US union said the tariff plan would be a ""knock-out blow"" to the international industry. Trump said on his Truth Social platform: ""It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded to the announcement, saying ""We're on it"". But the details are unclear. Trump's statement did not say whether the tariff would apply to American production companies producing films abroad. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" Several recent major films produced by US studios were shot outside of America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. It was also unclear if the tariffs would apply to films on streaming services, such as Netflix, as well as those shown at cinemas, or how they would be calculated. The founder of European cinema chain Vue, Timothy Richards, questioned how Trump would define a US film. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""Is it where the money comes from? The script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?"" Mr Richards said the cost of filming in southern California had grown significantly over the last few decades, prompting filmmakers to move production to locations including the UK, which have increasingly offered tax incentives and lower costs. ""But it's not just the actual financing itself,"" he added. ""One of reasons UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly experienced and skilled film and production crew in the world. ""The devil will be in the details."" Meanwhile, UK media union Bectu warned the tariffs could ""deal a knock-out blow"" to the industry and its tens of thousands of freelancers, as it recovered from the pandemic and a ""recent slowdown"". Union chief Philippa Childs told the BBC: ""The government must move swiftly to defend this vital sector, and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest."" The UK government said it was ""absolutely committed"" to ensuring its film sector continued to thrive and create jobs, and would set out plans to do so in its upcoming Creative Industries Sector Plan. It added that talks on an economic deal with the US were ongoing but a ""running commentary"" on progress was ""not in the national interest"". The British Film Institute said it was working closely with the government and industry partners in the UK and the US ""while we understand the detail of the proposal"". ""We want to keep collaboration at the heart of our sectors, so we remain a constructive partner to our friends in the US and internationally,"" it said. The US remains a major film production hub globally despite challenges, according to movie industry research firm ProdPro. Its most recent annual report shows the country saw $14.54bn (£10.94bn) of production spending last year. Although that was down by 26% since 2022. And NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry. Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it ""harder for these films to make profits overseas"". ""It may create a situation where the tariffs in America are causing more harm than good,"" he added. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the five major US film studios, declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. Countries that have attracted an increase in spending since 2022 include Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, according to ProdPro. Following Trump's remarks, Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said: ""Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry."" Industry body Screen Producers Australia said that while there were ""many unknowns"" about the plan, there was ""no doubt it will send shock waves worldwide"". New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon also said his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs. ""But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,"" he told a news conference. Ahead of his inauguration, Trump appointed three film stars - Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone - to be special ambassadors tasked with promoting business opportunities in Hollywood, which he described as a ""great but very troubled place"". Trump wrote at the time: ""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK - BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!"" Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed tariffs on countries around the world. He argues tariffs - which are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries - will boost US manufacturers and protect jobs. But the global economy has been thrown into chaos as a result, and prices on goods around the world are expected to rise. Even before this most recent announcement, the US movie industry had been impacted by the fallout from Trump's trade policies. In April, China said it was reducing its quota of American films allowed into the country. ""The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favourability towards American films,"" the China Film Administration said. ""We will follow the market rules, respect the audience's choice, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.""

OpenAI says non-profit will remain in control after backlash,OpenAI says non-profit will remain in control after backlash,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy603eg0w8o,"OpenAI, the parent of artificial intelligence service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan after a bitter power struggle over the business. Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its non-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation. Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit. The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity. Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion. OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the start-up made the decision ""after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California"". In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a ""big"", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals. He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits. That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money. ""We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,"" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. ""This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler."" Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission. In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people ""build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward"". ""It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude,"" he wrote. It is not clear to what extent the new plan will satisfy investors or critics. After the announcement Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics adviser, who had spearheaded last month's letter, said the update did not resolve issues such as who would own the firm's technology and how its goals would be prioritised. ""We're glad that OpenAI is listening to concerns from civil society leaders ... but crucial questions remain,"" he said.

Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01kx3yrmvo,"Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries. Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying ""a very fast death"". In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a ""calm and steady approach"" to talks in a bid to ""ease pressure on UK businesses"". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being ""jobless"" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a ""knock-out blow"". The UK film sector is worth £1.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October. Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed. White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit. ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said. Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is ""dominated"" by inward investment from US studios and that this ""brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK"". Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned ""against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe"" when the report came out. ""President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,"" she said. Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios. She urged ministers to ""urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way"". Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must ""get a grip"" to secure a trade deal with the US and ""protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success"". It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: ""The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means. ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot? ""Hollywood… has been in decline for some time,"" he said. ""A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia."" He added: ""One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world."" Bell concurred that ""the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places"" and lower costs. ""People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed."" She added: ""The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood."" According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20 percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (£248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive. A government spokesperson said on Monday: ""The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world. ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon. ""Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers."" Dozens of Hollywood blockbusters in recent years have actually seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, including:"
What impact might Trump's Hollywood tariffs plan have?,What impact might Trump's Hollywood tariffs plan have?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy04kjwk09o,"US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying ""a very fast death"". He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if ""they're happy"" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry. So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business, including the UK? Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was ""dying"". So is it? It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years. The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing. Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses. Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes. Then the wildfires struck earlier this year. And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content. The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far. The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season. But Hollywood is definitely still up against it. The president says he wants to ""immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!"" This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad. Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas. We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively. Trump later told reporters that ""other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States"", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that ""no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made"", and added that the administration is ""exploring all options"". We will have to wait for more detail. Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on. But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad. Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol? What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London? And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood. Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with. Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as ""grossly incompetent"" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually. While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: ""We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law."" There are more questions than answers at this stage. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods. And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing? Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?"" And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries? Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs. Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market. Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: ""Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real. ""Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way."" Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, ""was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK"". ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" she told PA. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries. ""Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,"" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said. New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs. ""But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,"" he added. And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights. Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made. More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale. NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry. Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it ""harder for these films to make profits overseas"". ""It may create a situation where the tariffs in America are causing more harm than good,"" he added."
Elon Musk's Starbase in Texas will officially become a city,Elon Musk's Starbase in Texas will officially become a city,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39j8rj4nmmo,"The area where Elon Musk's SpaceX company operates on the southern tip of Texas is to officially become a city called Starbase. Residents approved incorporating a patch of land as the new municipality in an election on Saturday. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote ""Starbase, Texas is now a real city!"" on his social media platform X. The new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012. The city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment. Since SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised. About 500 people are estimated to live nearby. The possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote. The first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. The BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment. Starbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League. A bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity. Currently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island. The result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year. The top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures. In recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics. The headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase. In contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers – most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities. Environmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. In 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (£113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water. The company has called the fines the result of ""disagreements over paperwork"" and maintains it follows environmental laws. The BBC approached SpaceX for comment."
"Seeking spending cuts, GOP targets a tax hospitals love to pay Republicans, on the hunt for spending cuts, are eying a special kind of Medicaid tax that nearly every state uses to boost funding for hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers. 35M AGO","Seeking spending cuts, GOP lawmakers target a tax hospitals love to pay",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-spending-cuts-medicaid-tax-hospitals/,"On the eastern plains of Colorado, in a county of less than 6,000 people, Lincoln Health runs the only hospital within a 75-minute drive. The facility struggles financially, given its small size and the area's tiny population. But for over a decade, the Hugo, Colorado-based health system has remained afloat partially thanks to a surprising source: special taxes on the state's hospitals. The taxes Lincoln pays help cover the state's Medicaid costs and — because the federal government matches a portion of what states spend on Medicaid — enable Colorado to claim more federal money. That generally leads to more dollars for the hospital. The tax proceeds also have helped Colorado expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover 400,000 more low-income adults, significantly reducing the number of people showing up at hospital doors without insurance. Last year, Lincoln paid $500,000 in provider taxes but netted more than $3.6 million extra from Medicaid, accounting for about 15% of its budget, said Lincoln CEO Kevin Stansbury. ""These dollars allow me to care for patients who are enrolled in Medicaid and to break even rather than lose money,"" he said. ""Without them, it would significantly impact our ability to survive."" Every state except Alaska uses at least one provider tax to boost its federal Medicaid dollars. But Republicans who control Congress are looking for potential cuts in the nearly $900 billion Medicaid program to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts — and have sought to portray provider taxes as malicious, sometimes even deriding them as ""money laundering."" Lawmakers say they may curtail or eliminate provider taxes as part of legislation to enact Mr. Trump's domestic agenda. ""It's infuriating,"" Stansbury said. Medicaid and the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program together cover roughly 79 million low-income and disabled people and are jointly financed by states and the federal government. Federal dollars match state payments with no limit. While the split varies based on a state's per capita income, the federal match ranges from 50% to 77% for children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, who make up most of the enrollment. States started using provider taxes in the 1980s to help pay their share and gain additional Medicaid funds from the federal government. Brian Blase, a former Trump health policy adviser who leads the conservative Paragon Health Institute, sees provider taxes as one of the highest forms of waste in Medicaid. States and their hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers aren't held accountable for how the tax money is used, reducing incentives for states to control Medicaid spending, he said. ""This has been a feature of the program for four decades, and it is a feature that is getting worse,"" Blase said. The Congressional Budget Office estimates eliminating provider taxes would save the federal government more than $600 billion over a decade. Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), who chairs the House committee that oversees Medicaid, has said provider taxes are on the menu for potential cuts. Other changes Republicans are considering to cut federal Medicaid spending include requiring adult enrollees to prove they're working as a condition of eligibility, as well as ending higher payments for adults enrolled as part of the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program. Since 2014, more than 20 million nondisabled adults in 40 states and Washington, D.C., have gained coverage under the expansion. House Republicans have set a Memorial Day deadline to come to an agreement on spending cuts, which would help pay for extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts passed during Mr. Trump's first administration and set to expire at the end of this year. The Government Accountability Office and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a congressional advisory board, have raised concerns about the provider taxes, which effectively saddle federal taxpayers with state expenses. Republican and Democrat presidents have criticized or proposed curtailing the use of Medicaid provider taxes — including Mr. Trump in his first term, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden while serving as vice president. But opposition from hospitals, nursing homes, and states snuffed out any move to limit or end the arrangements. Colorado and other states often use the money to maintain or increase payments to providers, which are often paid less by Medicaid than by Medicare, the federal program primarily for people 65 or older, or private insurers. States have added provider taxes to help generate federal money to cope with economic downturns and budget constraints. Hospitals in Idaho last year began paying an additional provider tax to increase pay to hospitals and home- and community-based providers. The tax came as Idaho's Republican-controlled legislature sought to add many conditions that threatened to end the state's Medicaid expansion — which would also eliminate a key source of increased federal funding. Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association, said funding from the hospital tax helps boost Medicaid payments to about 80% of Medicare's rates instead of 60%. ""We still lose money on every Medicare and Medicaid patient,"" he said. ""The state recognizes that this money helps offset the losses we take under Medicaid reimbursement."" While hospitals and nursing homes have been the main beneficiaries of provider tax proceeds, ambulance services have also paid and benefited from Medicaid taxes. States increasingly have also approved Medicaid taxes on private insurers that operate their Medicaid programs to gain more federal funds. California's Medicaid managed care tax began in 2009 and is expected to generate nearly $9 billion in net revenue for the 2024-25 fiscal period — or about 5% of the state's Medicaid budget, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office. In recent years, California has extended full Medicaid coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal status. Federal law prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to cover people in the country without authorization, but states can use their own money. At a presentation to congressional staffers in April, Blase cited California's strategy as an example of provider tax abuse and claimed the state is effectively laundering federal funds to cover people living in the country illegally. In practice, the tax has been a kind of fiscal pressure valve generally offsetting state spending. A ballot measure that passed in November now requires that much of the money from California's tax specifically be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Hospital officials and state Medicaid leaders argue the term ""money laundering"" is an inaccurate way to describe provider taxes, since they are allowed by federal law. But Blase said calling the levies a ""tax"" is misleading, pointing out that most businesses don't typically advocate to pay one. Jamie Whitney, chief legal officer for Texas-based Adelanto HealthCare Ventures, a consulting firm, said that provider taxes are a politically neutral way to help states pay for Medicaid and that curtailing their use would harm them all. ""This is not a red-state, blue-state issue,"" she said. Colorado is one of more than a dozen states that have funded an ACA Medicaid expansion using provider tax money. Others include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Colorado implemented its Medicaid provider tax effort in 2009. In the 2024 fiscal year, about $5 billion of the state's $15 billion Medicaid program was funded by provider taxes, according to the state. The money helps the state pay higher Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals, which reduces their need to charge higher rates to private insurers, said Kim Bimestefer, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which oversees Medicaid. Some of the extra payments are dependent on hospitals meeting certain quality and patient-safety metrics, such as reducing readmission rates after patients are discharged — a requirement state officials say improves care for everyone. The provider taxes also fund a program allowing working residents with disabilities to buy into Medicaid coverage even if their income is as high as 300% of the federal poverty level, or $46,950 for an individual. About 20,000 people are enrolled in the program. Among them is Alison Sbrana, 31, of Fort Collins, Colorado, who has a type of chronic fatigue syndrome and relies on Medicaid to cover long-term home care. ""It would be devastating if the benefit went away,"" said Sbrana, who works as a researcher and activist for those with the same disorder. ""I would be forced to stop working to keep my income low enough to qualify."" The state's provider taxes also pay for a $60 million fund to support rural hospitals, helping them add telehealth services, recruit surgeons, and hire paramedics, according to a state report. Konnie Martin, CEO of San Luis Valley Health, a two-hospital system based in Alamosa, Colorado, said her nonprofit paid $5.4 million in provider taxes last year and gained about $15 million in benefits from higher Medicaid payments and the rural grants. She said the money helps her hospital maintain obstetrical services, so residents don't have to drive 120 miles to the nearest maternity hospital. Without the birthing center, the entire region would suffer, she said. ""It also would gut the economy of the community, because young people will move away,"" she said.

"Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive national film tax credit. 4H AGO","Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit to ""Make America Film Again""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-gavin-newsom-film-tariffs-tax-credit/,"President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit. ""California built the film industry — and we're ready to bring even more jobs home. We've proven what strong state incentives can do,"" Newsom's post on X said. ""Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again."" His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was ""DYING a very fast death."" The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels. Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit from $330 million to $750 million. Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027. Mr. Trump said the American film industry has been ""decimated"" by other countries and the ""grossly incompetent"" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to ""abandon"" the U.S. But he vowed that ""we'll get it back."" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to ""make sure they're happy with"" the prospective tariffs. The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?"" Mr. Trump said. ""That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built."" Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage. ""And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,"" he said. He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California. ""I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,"" The president visited Los Angeles in late-January, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. ""I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. ""I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation."" Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor. ""I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,"" he said.

"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, two U.S. officials told CBS News. 6H AGO","Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-may-soon-deport-migrants-to-libya/,"The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans. Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

"For second time in 8 days, fighter jet assigned to USS Truman is lost in Red Sea Two pilots suffered minor injuries in the ordeal. 6H AGO","For second time in 8 days, U.S. fighter jet assigned to USS Truman is lost in Red Sea",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-fighter-jet-assigned-to-uss-truman-lost-red-sea-second-time/,"For the second time in just over a week, an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea, a defense official confirmed to CBS News. The two pilots aboard the aircraft sustained minor injuries in the ordeal. The official said in a statement that the Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman Tuesday ""when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard."" An arrestment is the mechanism that a carrier uses to safely slow down and halt a fighter jet as it lands. ""Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 11,"" the official said. ""The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries. No flight deck personnel were injured."" On April 28, a Super Hornet was being towed in the Truman hangar bay when crews lost control of the aircraft and it went overboard, along with the tow tractor. One sailor suffered minor injuries in the incident. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that initial reports suggested the jet may have fallen overboard after the carrier turned sharply while taking evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants. Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said in statement that the Super Hornet that went into the Red Sea Tuesday ""was not struck by the Houthis."" The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since it deployed to the Middle East in September 2024. In December, the USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 which had taken off from the Truman. The two-person crew were able to safely eject. In February, the Truman accidentally collided with a merchant vessel near the Suez Canal. Also Tuesday, President Trump disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to a deal that would see them halt their attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. Those attacks started in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. Eleanor Watson is a CBS News multi-platform reporter and producer covering the Pentagon."
Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza President Trump's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time. 8H AGO,Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-less-than-2-dozen-hostages-believed-to-be-alive-in-gaza/,"President Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. ""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. ""There's 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,"" Mr. Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition."
Trump touts $9 trillion in new U.S. investment. The numbers don't add up. Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims. 9H AGO,Trump touts $9 trillion in new U.S. investment. The numbers don't add up.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-check-trump-9-trillion-us-investments/,"After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States. ""I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. ""If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that."" He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years. Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion. Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term. Here's a breakdown of the claims. The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled ""The Trump Effect"" — which it said demonstrated ""his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment."" That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy. A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office. The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website. The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion. Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment — announced last October — in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina. The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed ""immediately,"" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term. But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term. However, Biden's list of investments highlighted ""a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries"" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's ""Investing in America"" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list. By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries — many without clear timelines or locations. For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by the Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally. However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action. ""Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,"" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. ""It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama."" Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report. During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments. Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place — but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Trump, may take years to assess. ""It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,"" Nigro said.

"Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's industry ties Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging other Democrats not to support a bipartisan crypto regulation bill, as Democrats warn about President Trump's ties to crypto. 10H AGO",Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's ties to the industry,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-genius-act-stablecoin-crypto-bill-trump/,"Washington — Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday ""we need to start moving forward."" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. ""Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,"" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, ""Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption."" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. ""Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately."" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's ""serious risks"" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."" ""Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,"" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the ""single largest-ever investment in a crypto company"" and sets a ""historic precedent."" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

Ed Martin's judicial nomination may be at risk as Tillis says he'll vote against him Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it looks like Martin's nomination probably won't make it out of committee. 12H AGO,Ed Martin's judicial nomination may be at risk as Tillis says he'll vote against him,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ed-martin-judicial-nomination-jeopardy-thom-tillis/,"The nomination of Ed Martin, President Trump's controversial pick to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, may be in jeopardy as the ""Stop the Steal"" advocate who backed Jan. 6 rioters struggles to find sufficient Republican support in the Senate. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced Tuesday that he won't support Martin's nomination. And with that, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Martin's nomination may not make it out of the judiciary panel for a floor vote. The committee has 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, meaning that if everyone votes along party lines and Republicans lose no one else, Martin's nomination would end in a tie. ""I think that would suggest that he's not probably going to get out of committee,"" Thune told reporters Tuesday. Tillis told reporters that he ""indicated to the White House I wouldn't support his nomination."" ""Most of my concerns are related to Jan. 6,"" Tillis told reporters, adding he has ""no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on Jan. 6, and that's probably where most of the friction was."" ""If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protests happened, I'd probably support him,"" Tillis said. Sen. Dick Durbin, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, said the ""writing's on the wall"" for Martin. President Trump nominated Martin to run the office that prosecuted more than 1,500 Capitol defendants, although Martin previously worked to defend some of those very same people. Martin has been serving as the District's top prosecutor in an acting capacity since Inauguration Day. Martin has said he shares Mr. Trump's view of the Capitol attack as a ""day of love,"" and he has already fired some of the prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney expires May 20. Asked by reporters at his weekly news conference later Tuesday whether he would move to discharge Martin from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Thune said, ""we will cross that bridge if and when we come to it, but it's ultimately going to be a decision that the Judiciary Committee makes first.""

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the agreement, sharing Albusaidi's post on X and calling it a ""Massive WIN."" The Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group, have targeted ships in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea since 2023, disrupting crucial shipping lanes that lead to the Suez Canal. The group frames the strikes as a response to Israeli military action in the Gaza Strip. The U.S. military has responded in recent weeks with a barrage of airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, a strategy the Pentagon says has killed hundreds of Houthi militants. Israel has also carried out its own airstrikes on the Houthis, including a set of strikes earlier Tuesday, following a Houthi missile attack on Israel's largest airport. The U.S. was not involved in Tuesday's strikes by Israel, officials said. The Houthis' response to those strikes did not indicate a planned truce with the U.S. ""The Israeli and American aggression will not pass without a response and will not deter Yemen from continuing its position in support of Gaza,"" the group's political bureau said prior to Mr. Trump's comments Tuesday, in a statement carried on its TV channel al-Masirah.

Most of the Oval Office meeting focused on tariffs and the relationship between Canada and the U.S., with Carney emphatically telling Mr. Trump that Canada is ""not for sale"" and ""won't be for sale, ever,"" while Mr. Trump called the border between the U.S. and Canada ""artificial"" and again raised the idea of Canada joining the U.S. But part way through the meeting, the president digressed to talk about the Obama Presidential Library, which is being built in Chicago's Jackson Park. In his comments, he derided the project and blamed ""DEI"" and ""woke"" for it being ""a disaster."" ""I mean look, President Obama — and if he wanted help, I'd give him help because I build on time and on budget — he's building his presidential library in Chicago. It's a disaster,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And he said something to the effect, 'I only want DEI, I only want woke.' He wants woke people to build it. Well, he got woke people and they have massive cost overruns, the job is stopped. I don't know, it's a disaster."" According to updates posted on the Obama Foundation website, work has continued to close the exterior of building and install glass and granite finishing, and instal interior windows on the museum levels. The foundation said insulation has also been installed in several other buildings at the complex. However, Mr. Trump claimed the center is ""millions of dollars, like many, many — I mean, really, millions of dollars over budget,"" and said the problems were because Pres. Obama ""wanted to be very politically correct and he didn't use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers that I love."" ""He wanted people that, like, never did it before and he's got a disaster on his hands,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation said the president's comments were not based in fact and said they believe he was referencing ""a relatively common dispute between two subcontractors over work that has already been completed."" ""Everyone who sees the Obama Presidential Center is blown away by its beauty, scale and the way it will be an economic engine for Chicago and a beacon of hope for the world,"" the foundation said in a statement. ""We look forward to welcoming all visitors to the 19.3-acre campus next spring, to experience a presidential center that not only honors the Obamas' legacy but also lifts up the next generation of leaders."" The center's website touts their use of union labor to build the center, which is privately funded and does not use taxpayer dollars. Construction has been ongoing throughout the often-harsh Chicago winter, and the foundation continues to expect that the Obama Presidential Center will open to the public in 2026. The Obama Presidential Center is a large complex on the city's South Side that includes a fruit and vegetable garden, athletic and events facility, a museum, an auditorium, a branch of the Chicago Public Library and more.

Supreme Court lets Trump enforce transgender military ban for now President Trump issued an executive order in January that targeted active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria. 13H AGO,Supreme Court clears way for Trump administration to enforce transgender military ban for now,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-transgender-military-ban/,"Washington — The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will allow the Trump administration to implement its policy barring transgender people from serving in the military while legal proceedings move forward. The high court agreed to pause a lower court order that had blocked the administration from implementing its ban nationwide. The Justice Department sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court left in place that district court's injunction. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would deny the administration's request. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cheered the Supreme Court's order as a ""massive victory"" and said in a social media post that President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ""are restoring a military that is focused on readiness and lethality – not DEI or woke gender ideology."" But Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign, which are representing the service members challenging the ban, reiterated their belief that the policy violates the Constitution and will ultimately be invalidated. ""Today's Supreme Court ruling is a devastating blow to transgender service members who have demonstrated their capabilities and commitment to our nation's defense,"" the groups said in a statement. ""By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice. Transgender individuals meet the same standards and demonstrate the same values as all who serve."" The policy stems from an executive order Mr. Trump signed in January that targeted active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria. The measure said the military's ""high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity and integrity"" are inconsistent with the ""medical, surgical and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria."" Mr. Trump's directive said the ""adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member."" SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit representing transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, has disputed that characterization, saying: ""Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve."" The president banned transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, and the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect in 2019. But former President Joe Biden revoked that policy when he took office in 2021. Following Mr. Trump's new executive order, Hegseth directed the Pentagon to pause new accessions for people with a history of gender dysphoria and halt gender-affirming medical procedures. The Defense Department then issued a new policy in February that disqualified people with gender dysphoria from military service unless they obtained a waiver. The branches had to start identifying and separating transgender service members by March 26. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. Between January 2016 and May 2021, roughly 1,892 service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon, according to the Congressional Research Service. A defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The Pentagon spent roughly $52 million on medical care to treat gender dysphoria between 2015 and 2024, according to a Defense Department memo. The Trump administration's ban led to legal challenges filed in Washington, D.C., and Tacoma, Washington. The case before the Supreme Court stems from the lawsuit brought in Tacoma on behalf of seven transgender service members, one transgender person who wants to join the military and an advocacy group. The plaintiffs argued the policy unconstitutionally discriminated against them based on sex and transgender status. A federal district court judge agreed in March to block implementation of the ban and required the Trump administration to reinstate the policy put in place by Biden. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit then declined to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and allow the administration to enforce the ban while litigation proceeds. The Justice Department had argued in a Supreme Court filing that Mr. Trump's policy draws classifications not based on transgender status and sex, but by medical condition, gender dysphoria. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote that the political branches have the authority to decide the composition of the armed forces, which the Pentagon exercised when it decided to exclude transgender people from military service. ""[I]f the separation of powers means anything, the government obviously suffers irreparable harm when an unelected judge usurps the role of the political branches in operating the nation's armed forces,"" Sauer wrote. He argued that the district court's injunction forces the military to maintain a policy — issued under the Biden administration — that the Pentagon found to be inconsistent with the interests of national security. But lawyers for the transgender service members said that allowing the Trump administration to enforce the ban would upend the status quo because it would clear the way for the government to start discharging thousands of transgender service members, ending their careers and hollowing out military units. ""The record is clear and indubitable: equal service by openly transgender servicemembers has improved our military's readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion, while discharging transgender servicemembers from our Armed Forces would harm all three, as well as the public fisc,"" referring to public finances, they wrote in a filing. The transgender members of the armed forces said that the ban is awash with animus toward transgender people and noted that while the Supreme Court allowed an earlier iteration to take effect during the first Trump administration, this policy is much broader as it would force the expulsion of every transgender service member. ""The ban was issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people — even in their personal lives — and rendering them unequal to others,"" they wrote.

Second judge blocks Trump administration's use of Alien Enemies Act A federal judge in New York said President Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act exceeded the scope of the law. 15H AGO,Second judge blocks Trump administration's use of Alien Enemies Act to remove certain migrants,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-trump-alien-enemies-act-southern-district-of-new-york/,"Washington — A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained in the Southern District of New York under President Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said in a 22-page decision that the president's March proclamation ordering the summary removal of Venezuelan migrants exceeded the scope of the Alien Enemies Act, an 1798 law that the Trump administration has relied on to deport noncitizens that his administration claims are part of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president the power to detain and deport migrants when there is a declared war between the U.S. and a foreign nation, or when there is an ""invasion"" or ""predatory inclusion"" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government. But Hellerstein, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said that the Trump administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion or predatory incursion. Because of that, the Alien Enemies Act ""was not validly invoked by the presidential proclamation,"" he wrote. The judge said noncitizens in his judicial district can still be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the district court ""joined several others in correctly recognizing the president cannot simply declare that there's been an invasion and then invoke a wartime authority during peacetime to send individuals to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador without even giving them due process."" Hellerstein is the second federal judge to bar Trump administration officials from using the proclamation invoking the 1798 law to remove certain Venezuelan migrants at risk of deportation. U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, ruled last week that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful and blocked administration officials from using the law and the president's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in southern Texas. Challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act have been filed throughout the country in response to a Supreme Court decision last month that allowed removals under the law. But the high court said that Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration are entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained. The two-century-old law has only been employed previously during three periods of declared wars. But in March, Mr. Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the gang Tren de Aragua ""is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States."" Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as ""alien enemies."" The declaration claimed that the gang is undertaking ""hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare"" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime. But an April assessment from the National Intelligence Council obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation through a public records request found that ""while Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States."" The declassified assessment said that most of the intelligence community ""judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible."" The case before Hellerstein was brought by two plaintiffs — identified in filings as G.F.F. and J.G.O. — who were initially detained at the Orange County Jail in New York and were transferred to an immigration facility in Texas to be deported to El Salvador. But they were removed from a plane in response to temporary orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., as part of a challenge to Mr. Trump's efforts to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. That case ultimately landed before the Supreme Court. The two plaintiffs were returned to the jail, where they remain confined and ""under threat of imminent removal,"" according to Hellerstein's opinion. The migrants brought a challenge under habeas corpus in early April in the Southern District of New York on behalf of themselves and other noncitizens in the region at risk of deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and Hellerstein agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from removing them from the U.S. under the president's proclamation unless they received a notice in English and Spanish and a hearing. His temporary order was to remain in place while he considered the Venezuelan migrants request for a preliminary injunction, which he granted Tuesday after finding that absent such relief, they would be deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. Hellerstein said that once there, ""they would endure abuse and inhumane treatment with no recourse to bring them back."" In his opinion, Hellerstein first called the notice provided by immigration officers to those subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act a ""fleeting affair"" and a ""bare bones form letter."" ""Petitioners have not been given notice of what they allegedly did to join TdA, when they joined, and what they did in the United States, or anywhere else, to share or further the illicit objectives of the TdA,"" Hellerstein wrote. ""Without such proof, petitioners are subject to removal by the executive's dictate alone, in contravention of the AEA and the constitutional requirements of due process."" The judge said that the procedures used by the Trump administration have already led to the wrongful removal of at least two migrants to CECOT. One of those migrants is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly removed to El Salvador as a result of an ""administrative error."" A federal judge, U.S. appeals court and the Supreme Court have said the U.S. has to facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody, but the Trump administration has claimed it's up to El Salvador to return him. Hellerstein also said that the grounds for Mr. Trump's proclamation — that Tren de Aragua has engaged in either a war, invasion or predatory incursion of the U.S. — ""do not exist."" ""There is nothing in the AEA that justifies a finding that refugees migrating from Venezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate the migrants, are engaged in an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion,'"" he wrote. ""They do not seek to occupy territory, to oust American jurisdiction from any territory, or to ravage territory. TdA may well be engaged in narcotics trafficking, but that is a criminal matter, not an invasion or predatory incursion."" The Trump administration can appeal the decision.

Department of Transportation is latest federal agency expecting layoffs Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy informed DOT employees during a town hall that the layoffs are expected soon. 17H AGO,Department of Transportation is latest federal agency expecting layoffs,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/department-of-transportation-layoffs-federal-agencies/,"Employees at the Department of Transportation are bracing for layoffs, as part of the Trump administration's effort to cut the federal workforce. During a town hall meeting last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy informed DOT employees that the layoffs — referred to as reduction in force, or RIF — are expected soon, DOT officials confirm to CBS News. An employee attending the town hall said Duffy did not offer specifics about which agencies or employees would be affected. The Department of Transportation said the final number of cuts would depend on how many employees first take a buyout offer. The cuts could happen as soon as the end of the month. The buyout offer, referred to as a deferred resignation program, allows workers to receive pay and benefits for several months if they agree to resign. Multiple federal agencies have made large-scale buyout offers as part of President Trump's effort to dramatically scale back the size of the federal government. Duffy has promised the DOT's workforce cuts won't affect airline safety. Duffy became Transportation Secretary amid two high-profile airline crashes, including a midair collision in January over the Potomac River in Washington that left 67 dead. On May 1, Duffy announced plans to boost air traffic controller recruiting. The announcement came as Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the country's largest and busiest hubs, experienced an onslaught of delays and canceled flights. Blaming staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions and system outages, the DOT's Federal Aviation Administration issued several ground delays and ground stops at the New Jersey airport. Arriving flights at the airport, located near New York City, have been delayed as long as six hours, while departures faced nearly four-hour delays. The FAA and the union representing air traffic controllers said Tuesday that multiple members are on trauma leave due to the equipment failure that caused them to lose communication with pilots.

"House GOP leaders look to reassure conference on ""big, beautiful bill"" momentum House GOP leaders stressed early this week that the budget package central to President Trump's agenda remains on track even as they acknowledged a delay. 15H AGO","House GOP leaders look to reassure conference on momentum amid delays on Trump's ""big, beautiful bill""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-budget-big-beautiful-bill-house-republicans-momentum/,"Washington — House GOP leaders stressed early this week that the budget package central to President Trump's agenda remains on track even as they acknowledged a delay that comes amid simmering disagreements in the Republican conference that have threatened to stunt progress on reconciliation. ""It just made sense for us to push pause for a week to make sure that we do this right,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday at his weekly news conference. The committee work on budget reconciliation officially kicked off last week, as a number of panels considered their portions of the major package, which is aimed at addressing the president's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. But a handful of key committees have yet to schedule votes on their portions of the budget package, after Johnson said leaders made a decision to push the markups back a week, while disagreements persist over some of the most divisive elements of the forthcoming legislation — like an expansion to the state and local tax deduction and Medicaid cuts. Johnson on Tuesday expressed confidence that the lower chamber would complete its work by Memorial Day, a day after acknowledging to reporters that he put the package on a ""very ambitious time table"" and that the self-imposed deadline could slip past the holiday. ""We can pass that by Memorial Day. That was our original timeframe,"" he said. Committees face a May 9 deadline to complete their committee work under the budget resolution that the House and Senate adopted in April. But Johnson said the plan is to have committees complete their work and send the components of the bill to the House Budget Committee, which will incorporate the recommendations for the government's spending into a massive legislative package, by the end of next week. The House Energy and Commerce Committee had been targeting a Wednesday markup, but the panel has yet to schedule one. The House Ways and Means Committee and Agriculture Committee have yet to complete their work as well. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with identifying the biggest spending cuts — at least $880 billion over the next decade. The effort has become among the most closely watched in the reconciliation process, as Republicans look to dispel concerns about cuts to the popular entitlement program, stressing that they intend solely to root out waste, fraud and abuse, while some GOP hard-liners seek deeper spending cuts. Meanwhile, disagreements over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, have come before the Ways and Means Committee, as conservatives oppose a push to increase the cap from Republicans in blue states. Still, Ways and Means Committee chairman Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, said Sunday on Fox News that House Republicans will ""get the job done,"" adding that ""failure is simply not an option."" ""We're going to find the equilibrium point on SALT that no one will be totally delighted with, but it'll solve the equation, and we'll get it done,"" Johnson said Monday, referring to the deduction by its acronym. Johnson said Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump that day about budget reconciliation, and he noted that leadership is meeting with groups of members in the GOP conference on Tuesday as they try to push forward on the process. At his Tuesday news conference, Johnson was asked whether he has made assurances to the moderate and conservative factions of his conference that he can't keep. ""I don't make promises that I can't keep. This is a consensus building operation,"" he said. ""We've been working really hard to take all the input and find that kind of equilibrium point where everybody is at least satisfied. Some people are not going to be elated by every provision of the bill. It's impossible. The bill is one big, beautiful bill."" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told members in their morning meeting that they need to ""focus on the totality of the bill and not just individual details,"" according to Johnson. But Scalise also alluded to the plan slipping beyond Memorial Day, telling reporters Tuesday after the Republican conference meeting that ""we're on track to continue to deliver on this one big, beautiful bill and get it through the process and ideally to get it on the president's desk in June."" Lawmakers also cast doubt on whether they could meet the Memorial Day deadline. ""That's wishful thinking, I guess,"" Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, said. ""But you know, when I raised the speed limit in Tennessee to 70, I asked for 85. And 70 is what I wanted, so."" Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican, said ""the fact that we're having the conversation is good,"" but he added that ""we've got to act."" Meanwhile, House Democrats unveiled a discharge petition Tuesday, seeking to force a vote on legislation to prevent ""devastating cuts"" to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffies said with the discharge petition, House Democrats have ""given Republicans an opportunity to actually not simply talk about defending the best interests of the American people, but be about it."" ""The discharge petition is now live on the House floor,"" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said. ""All we need are four House Republicans to do the right thing."" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, filed the discharge petition on Tuesday, which would allow lawmakers to bypass House leadership to bring legislation to the floor for a vote. But with 213 Democrats in the chamber, four Republicans would need to join with them to secure a majority and move forward with the discharge petition. The underlying legislation the Democrats are seeking to force a vote on would prevent Congress from reducing enrollment or benefits for individuals enrolled in the Medicaid and SNAP programs, which offer health coverage and food assistance to low-income Americans.

"Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's ""act of war"" 1H AGO","Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's strikes, calling them an ""act of war""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-pakistan-kashmir-strikes-sharif-revenge-modi/,"Islamabad — India fired missiles into Pakistani-controlled territory in several locations early Wednesday, killing at least 26 people including a child, in what Pakistan's leader called an act of war. India said it struck infrastructure used by militants linked to last month's massacre of tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. Pakistan said it had shot down several Indian fighter jets in retaliation as three planes fell onto villages in India-controlled Kashmir. At least seven civilians were also killed in the region by Pakistani shelling, Indian police and medics said. Tension has soared between the nuclear-armed neighbors since an attack in which gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, at a popular meadow in the disputed territory of Kashmir, in some cases killing men before their wives' eyes. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the attack, something Islamabad has denied. Kashmir, which is divided between the two countries but claimed in its entirety by each, has been at the center of tensions for decades and they have fought two wars over it. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Wednesday's airstrikes and said his country would retaliate. ""Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given,"" Sharif said. The country's National Security Committee met Wednesday morning, and Pakistan summoned India's charge d'affaires to lodge a protest. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a special meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security. A source told the Reuters news agency Modi postponed a trip to Croatia, the Netherlands and Norway. South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said it was one the highest-intensity strikes from India on its rival in years and that Pakistan's response would ""surely pack a punch as well."" ""These are two strong militaries that, even with nuclear weapons as a deterrent, are not afraid to deploy sizeable levels of conventional military force against each other,"" Kugelman said. ""The escalation risks are real. And they could well increase, and quickly."" Stephane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesperson, said in a statement late Tuesday that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint because the world could not ""afford a military confrontation"" between India and Pakistan. Several Indian states planned civil defense drills later Wednesday, according to India's home ministry, to train civilians and security personnel to respond in case of any ""hostile attacks,"" the ministry said in a statement. Such drills in India are rare in non-crisis times. Indian politicians from different political parties lauded the strikes. ""Victory to Mother India,"" India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X. India's main opposition Congress party called for national unity and said it was ""extremely proud"" of the country's army. ""We applaud their resolute resolve and courage,"" Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge said. India's army said the operation was named ""Sindoor,"" a Hindi word for the bright red vermillion powder worn by married Hindu women on their forehead and hair, referring to the women whose husbands were killed in front of them. India's missiles hit six locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country's eastern Punjab province, killing at least 26 people including women and children, said Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif. Officials said another 38 people were injured by the strikes, and another five people were killed in Pakistan during exchanges of fire across the border later in the day. Sharif said the Indian jets also damaged infrastructure at a dam in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, calling it a violation of international norms. India's Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted at least nine sites ""where terrorist attacks against India have been planned."" ""Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistan military facilities have been targeted,"" the statement said, adding that ""India has demonstrated considerable restraint."" Pakistan said the strikes hit at least two sites previously tied to banned militant groups. One hit the Subhan Mosque in Punjab's Bahawalpur city, killing 13 people including a child, according to Zohaib Ahmed, a doctor at a nearby hospital. The mosque is near a seminary that was once the central office of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group outlawed in 2002. Officials say the group has had no operational presence at the site since the ban. In a statement obtained by CBS News, Jaish-e-Mohammed's chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, claimed India's attack killed 10 of his family members and four close associates. He criticized Modi, saying, ""This cruelty has broken all limits—do not expect mercy anymore."" Another missile hit a mosque in Muridke, damaging its structure. A sprawling building located nearby served as the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba until 2013, when Pakistan banned the group and arrested its founder. Last month's attack on tourists was claimed by a group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance, which India says is also known as The Resistance Front and is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. In Muzaffarabad, the main city of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, resident Abdul Sammad said he heard several explosions as the blast ripped through houses. He saw people running in panic and authorities immediately cut power to the area. People took refuge on the streets and in open areas, fearful of what might happen. ""We were afraid the next missile might hit our house,"" said Mohammad Ashraf. Chaudhry Ghulam Rasool, who lives near the mosque, told CBS News, ""We were just about to go to bed when a huge blast happened. It was very big and terrifying explosions."" Along the Line of Control, which divides the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan, there were heavy exchanges of fire. The Indian police and medics said seven civilians were killed and 30 wounded by Pakistani shelling in Poonch district near the highly militarized Line of Control, the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir between the two countries. Officials said several homes also were damaged in the shelling. The Indian army said Pakistani troops ""resorted to arbitrary firing,"" including gunfire and artillery shelling, across the frontier. Shortly after India's strikes, aircraft fell onto three villages in India-controlled Kashmir. Sharif, the Pakistani military spokesperson, said the country's air force shot down five Indian jets in retaliation for the strikes. There was no immediate comment from India about Pakistan's claim. Debris from a plane was scattered across Wuyan village in the outskirts of the region's main city, including in a school and a mosque compound, according to Srinagar police and residents. Firefighters struggled for hours to douse the resulting fires. ""There was a huge fire in the sky. Then we heard several blasts also,"" said Mohammed Yousuf Dar, a Wuyan resident. Another aircraft fell in an open field in Bhardha Kalan village, near the Line of Control in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Village resident Sachin Kumar told The Associated Press he heard massive blasts followed by a huge ball of fire. Kumar said he and and several other villagers rushed to the scene and found two pilots with injuries. Both were later taken away by the Indian army. A third aircraft crashed in a farm field in India's northern Punjab state, a police office told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The officer did not provide further details. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, President Trump called the strikes ""a shame."" ""We just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They've been fighting for a long time. You know, they've been fighting for many many decades, and centuries actually, if you really think about it. No, I just hope it ends very quickly."" China called for restraint from both sides following India's strikes. ""China expresses regret over India's military actions this morning and is concerned about the current developments. China opposes all forms of terrorism,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in a statement. ""We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritize peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation."" Beijing is the largest investor in Pakistan by far, with a $65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project that spans across the country. China meanwhile also has multiple border claims disputed with India, with one of those claims in the northeastern part of the Kashmir region. French news agency AFP reports that British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio Wednesday the UK is ""a friend, a partner to both countries. We stand ready to support both countries. Both have a huge interest in regional stability, in dialogue, in de-escalation and anything we can do to support that, we are here and willing to do."" Moscow on Wednesday called for both India and Pakistan to show ""restraint,"" AFP says."
When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? UPDATED 53M AGO,When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? Here's how long it's taken to see white smoke in the past,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conclave-2025-when-will-cardinals-replace-pope-francis/,"It's nearing decision time for the most senior members of the Catholic Church. The 133 cardinal electors due to choose a successor to the late Pope Francis gathered for a final Mass on Wednesday morning, just hours before they were to launch the secretive, centuries-old ritual known as the conclave to pick a new pontiff. Later Wednesday, the electors will be locked inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, where they will hold as many rounds of voting as prove necessary to select the next leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take. The conclave begins on Wednesday — 16 days after Pope Francis' death. It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years. In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials. The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices. The 133 electors participating this time around can hold one round of voting in the afternoon of the first day of the conclave, which consists of two ballots. To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day. From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options. There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved. The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The longest conclave on record took nearly three years. The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long — about 1,000 days — that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision. That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope — ""conclave,"" which translates to ""under lock and key"" — came from. After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271. There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history. The last three popes have been elected in two or three days. In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots. Vatican watcher John Allen, the editor of the Catholic news outlet Crux, believes this conclave may well follow that pattern, and we could expect a new pope to be named by the end of the week. After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected, black smoke rises from the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises. Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting. White smoke was first used in 1914, when Cardinals decided the light colored smoke should announce the selection of a new pope, Georgtown University reported. Now, to ensure the result of each ballot is clear, chemicals are burned alongside the ballots in each round to color the smoke black or white. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"For second time in 8 days, fighter jet assigned to USS Truman is lost in Red Sea 6H AGO","For second time in 8 days, U.S. fighter jet assigned to USS Truman is lost in Red Sea",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-fighter-jet-assigned-to-uss-truman-lost-red-sea-second-time/,"For the second time in just over a week, an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea, a defense official confirmed to CBS News. The two pilots aboard the aircraft sustained minor injuries in the ordeal. The official said in a statement that the Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman Tuesday ""when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard."" An arrestment is the mechanism that a carrier uses to safely slow down and halt a fighter jet as it lands. ""Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 11,"" the official said. ""The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries. No flight deck personnel were injured."" On April 28, a Super Hornet was being towed in the Truman hangar bay when crews lost control of the aircraft and it went overboard, along with the tow tractor. One sailor suffered minor injuries in the incident. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that initial reports suggested the jet may have fallen overboard after the carrier turned sharply while taking evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants. Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said in statement that the Super Hornet that went into the Red Sea Tuesday ""was not struck by the Houthis."" The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since it deployed to the Middle East in September 2024. In December, the USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 which had taken off from the Truman. The two-person crew were able to safely eject. In February, the Truman accidentally collided with a merchant vessel near the Suez Canal. Also Tuesday, President Trump disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to a deal that would see them halt their attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. Those attacks started in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. Eleanor Watson is a CBS News multi-platform reporter and producer covering the Pentagon."
Trump wants the Fed to cut rates today. Will it oblige? 15H AGO,Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will Jerome Powell oblige?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-rate-cut-jerome-powell-may-7-fomc-meeting/,"President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been ""TOO LATE AND WRONG"" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision — but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction. The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty — costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out. ""The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,"" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email. He added, ""The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer."" Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7. The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day. Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. ""Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response — neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,"" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note. Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists. Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting. However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes. But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer. ""We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,"" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December. Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked. On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is ""NO INFLATION"" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon. But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined — gas costs are down 10% from a year ago — continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say. ""There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,"" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. ""No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates."" Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates. ""Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,"" he noted. ""When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards."" Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.

What U.S. Catholics are looking for in the next pope — CBS News poll 12H AGO,New pope could be elected in days. Here's what U.S. Catholics are looking for — CBS News poll,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-us-catholics-look-to-next-pope/,"In the eyes of U.S. Catholics, the next pope is going to have big — if not red — shoes to fill. Most say the Church is in touch with the needs of Catholics, a view that's higher today than when Pope Francis (who famously wore simple black shoes) became pontiff in 2013. Just before Francis' papacy, which today gets 76% approval, most U.S. Catholics said the Church was out of touch. As such, many U.S. Catholics would see the next pope continue Francis' teachings, and others would move toward still more progressive ones. Those who'd continue Francis' teachings tend to be younger. And by two to one, more U.S. Catholics overall say Francis' papacy left them feeling more connected to the Church than less. While most say it doesn't matter where the next pope comes from, plenty of U.S. Catholics — if given a choice — would like the next Pope to come from the U.S., their top choice out of other countries or regions. Hispanic Americans — who make up a third of US Catholics — also favor the U.S., but South America, Mexico and Central America are also noted. Most also want the next pope to be outspoken on world political issues. What kinds of changes are Catholics looking for? Most U.S. Catholics would look for a pope who is in favor of letting priests marry; of letting women be ordained as priests; and — overwhelmingly — for the use of birth control. But here again there are differences between the (smaller group of) regular churchgoers, and the larger group of U.S. Catholics who rarely or never go. These majority views are driven much more by the latter group, who also say the Church is out of touch with Catholics' needs — which may be one reason they'd seek a new pope in favor of changes such as these. Most U.S. Catholics want the next pope to continue to prioritize tradition in general, even as some specific things draw calls for change. And they have at least some confidence (if not a great deal) the conclave will choose a pope in touch with the needs of Catholics — this view is especially the case among the most frequent attendees. Those who think the Church is currently out of touch have comparably less confidence that the conclave will pick a pope who is. But the next pope will oversee a U.S. Catholic laity with some pronounced differences in views between a smaller group who say they attend Mass at least a few times per month — most of whom do think the Church is in touch — and a majority who say they attend only a few times a year or never, and think the Church is out of touch. And U.S. Catholics say they'll be paying attention. Most plan to follow news about the process and selection of a pope at least somewhat closely. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,298 adult Catholics living in the U.S. interviewed between April 30-May 5, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and Mass attendance according to the 2023-24 Pew Religious Landscape Study. The margin of error is ±3.8 points.

Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's industry ties 10H AGO,Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's ties to the industry,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-genius-act-stablecoin-crypto-bill-trump/,"Washington — Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday ""we need to start moving forward."" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. ""Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,"" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, ""Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption."" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. ""Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately."" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's ""serious risks"" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."" ""Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,"" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the ""single largest-ever investment in a crypto company"" and sets a ""historic precedent."" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

"HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program 10H AGO","HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-revokes-some-layoff-notices-including-to-911-program/,"The Department of Health and Human Services formally revoked some layoff notices on Tuesday, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, restoring some staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Tuesday's letters to laid-off workers notifying them that their employment was being restored went a step further from some previous reinstatements touted by department officials, which often amounted only to a request for civil servants to continue working for a few more weeks to wind down or prepare to hand off their assignments. ""You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) upcoming reduction in force (RIF). That notice is hereby revoked,"" read the letter received by some workers at the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides health care services to 9/11 first responders and survivors. A move last week to cut 15 employees of the 9/11 program, as part of a larger wave of eliminations that gutted most of the work from the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, prompted outcry from New York lawmakers. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. denied cutting the World Trade Center Health Program or NIOSH, which he said are slated to be merged into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America. ""Those programs were not terminated, as the media has reported. But they've simply been consolidated into a place that makes more sense,"" Kennedy said. Some of the FDA's laboratories also received notices Tuesday that they would be formally brought back to work as of Wednesday. Employees of the FDA's food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco all received notices that their layoffs were being reversed, though cuts to probationary workers in the labs have so far not been walked back. Letters to those scientists told them that their previous layoff notices were ""officially RESCINDED"" and that they would be expected to return to work on Wednesday. Not all of the workers that Kennedy or his department have promised to bring back to work have received notices restoring their jobs. Two other labs at the FDA — drug safety scientists in Puerto Rico and Detroit — have so far not received letters, multiple laid-off employees in the labs said. Employees of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health also remain off the job. Kennedy had said a month ago that he would restore the lead poisoning experts in the center, saying that some of the layoffs could have been mistakes. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details on which teams were cut and which were being brought back. Tuesday's move to reverse some layoffs at HHS comes days after the department laid off hundreds more employees at the National Institutes of Health, blindsiding staff who had survived the initial wave of cuts in April. Layoffs included staff at the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Library of Medicine and Office of Research Facilities, two people said. NIH employees were told that the additional cuts were prompted by a need to reinstate scientists while also meeting strict layoff quotas sought by the department.

Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza 8H AGO,Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-less-than-2-dozen-hostages-believed-to-be-alive-in-gaza/,"President Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. ""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. ""There's 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,"" Mr. Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition."
"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say","Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-may-soon-deport-migrants-to-libya/,"The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans. Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

5 charged after migrant boat capsized off San Diego coast,5 charged after migrant boat capsizes off San Diego; Noem asks DOJ for death penalty,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-migrant-boat-human-smuggling/,"Five Mexican nationals are facing charges after a small boat carrying more than a dozen people capsized off the coast of San Diego, killing three passengers, including a 14-year-old boy from India, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of California announced Tuesday. The boy's parents and two others were hospitalized following the human smuggling event, prosecutors confirmed in a news release. Nine other migrants were missing from the boat and were presumed dead, but authorities later located eight of them in Chula Vista, nearly 30 miles away from Del Mar, where the boat was found. A 10-year-old Indian girl, the boy's sister, remains missing, prosecutors said. ""The drowning deaths of these children are a heartbreaking reminder of how little human traffickers care about the costs of their deadly business,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said in a statement. U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday that there were originally 16 individuals on board, some of whom remain missing. Jesus Ivan Rodriguez-Leyva and Julio Cesar Zuniga-Luna were arrested on Monday at the beach where the overturned boat washed ashore, according to prosecutors. They were charged with Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Bringing in Aliens for Financial Gain, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday night announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty. ""Their deaths were not only avoidable but were also the direct result of the greed and indifference of smugglers who exploited them,"" Noem said in a statement, in part. ""Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, alien smuggling acts that result in death are capital crimes punishable by death. And under the Federal Death Penalty Act, those who intentionally participate in conduct knowing that it could result in the loss of life may be eligible for capital punishment."" Prosecutors said three other suspects — Melissa Jennelle Cota, Gustavo Lara and Sergio Rojas-Fregoso — were arrested late Monday night after Border Patrol agents in Chula Vista identified a vehicle seen at a beach in Del Mar and investigated. While the driver of said vehicle fled, officers located two other vehicles involved and found the missing migrants, according to prosecutors. Cota, Lara and Rojas-Fregoso were charged with Transportation of Illegal Aliens. Prosecutors said Rojas-Fregoso had been previously deported on Dec. 19, 2023. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. It was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles north of the Mexico border, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told The Associated Press. He said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. In 2023, eight people were killed when two boats capsized off the San Diego coast. Kiki Intarasuwan is a news editor for CBS News & Stations."

Najjar's debut novel follows Lola Fine, a New York City content creator who retreats to the Hamptons after being canceled, only to discover her summer neighbor is a culture critic who wrote a scathing exposé about her. The two unexpectedly begin a summer fling as Lola embarks on a journey of self-discovery. ""I really wanted my heroine to be complicated and layered, because we're all complicated and layered,"" Najjar told ""CBS Mornings."" ""I wanted her to be messy so that readers could see themselves in her, because we're really all imperfect. We're all works in progress.""

The book includes aspects of queer romance, which has drawn some criticism given Najjar's identity as a straight woman. Najjar said that she worked with a queer collaborator to ensure authentic representation. ""I think it's important to have a queer voice in the room, and that's why I wanted to work with a queer collaborator,"" she said.

It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics. ""Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,"" Harris told Vogue. ""Artistic expression — whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion — has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go."" To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,"" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said. While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States. Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own. Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028. ""Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'"" she said. Sources familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office.

The power couple is expecting their third child, the rapper A$AP Rocky confirmed. ""It feels amazing, you know,"" A$AP Rocky, gala co-chair, told reporters who congratulated him Monday after outlets reported the couple was expecting their third child. ""It's time that we show the people what we was cooking up. And I'm glad everybody's happy for us 'cause we definitely happy, you know."" TMZ reported earlier Monday that Rihanna and the rapper were expecting their third child. A representative for Rihanna didn't immediately return The Associated Press' request for comment. Photos taken of the singer on Monday walking in New York showed her with what appeared to be a baby bump. ""Honestly, it's a blessing nonetheless,"" Rocky told The AP. ""Because you know how like some people in other situations at times can be envious of other people. But we've been seeing love for the most part. And we real receptive to that and appreciate that, you know what I mean? That's love. Love is love."" This year, A$AP Rocky walked the blue carpet alone before Rihanna's arrival. She was among the last people to walk the carpet on Monday. The clothing and makeup entrepreneur and singer didn't attend the 2024 Met Gala, but in 2023, she and her longtime partner were also among the last to arrive. The couple announced their last pregnancy in a similarly starry way: At the 2023 Super Bowl, Rihanna emerged on stage for her halftime performance with a baby bump on full display. Their son Riot Rose was born later that year. The couple debuted the newest addition to their family in a rare photoshoot in September of that year. It also featured their first child, RZA, who was born in May 2022. Rocky is one of the 2025 Met Gala co-chairs of the menswear-theme event tied to the museum's ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style."" But his attendance at this year's Met Gala wasn't always a sure bet. That announcement came a couple of months before the opening of his trial on firearms charges in Los Angeles. Rocky was ultimately found not guilty in mid-February. Jurors had deliberated for just about three hours before reaching the verdict. At his trial, he showed his eye for fashion. He sported tailored suits and luxury labels throughout the proceedings. Yves Saint Laurent even put out press releases directing attention to his high-fashion court attire. He was clad in a pinstripe Saint Laurent suit for the verdict. Upon the reading of the verdict, Rocky ran toward the back of the room to hug Rihanna, who appeared inside the court on multiple occasions throughout the trial. Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, had faced up to 24 years in prison if he had been convicted of all charges. He's collaborated with several designers and brands on shoes, sunglasses and clothing collections. In December, he was honored with the Cultural Innovator Award at the British Fashion Council's Fashion Awards."

Ross, a music legend, is set to go back on tour in June across the United Kingdom and Europe. Earlier this year, the ""I'm Coming Out"" singer said she doesn't plan to ever retire. ""I'm never going to retire-they're going to have to drag me off the stage!,"" the singer wrote in a Facebook post. ""Every show is a celebration of life, love, and music. Florida, UK, Europe, and new dates coming soon! I want to see you there, dancing and singing with me."" Kiki Intarasuwan is a news editor for CBS News & Stations."
Here's how much it costs to attend the 2025 Met Gala Ticket prices to the 2025 Met Gala run more than the average down payment on a house — if you can snag an invite. MAY 5,How much does it cost to attend the 2025 Met Gala?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2025-met-gala-ticket-cost/,"Inflation has pushed up the price of many things, but not of tickets to the 2025 Met Gala. The A-list event, held annually on the first Monday in May to benefit The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, draws celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, business and other domains in support of the Met's acquisitions and exhibitions on fashion. While the cost of attending the event, dubbed ""fashion's biggest night,"" jumped in 2024, the price of tickets to this year's gala is unchanged. The catch? You must be invited to attend — tickets aren't available for purchase by the general public. The cost of entry to the 2025 Met Gala for an individual is $75,000. Tables for multiple guests start at $350,000. Often, couture powerhouses that sell high-end fashion will purchase tables and invite stars as their guests, so some celebrities won't pay a dime to attend. The Met Gala's theme changes every year to celebrate the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition. The year's theme: ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style."" It is the first Met exhibit devoted exclusively to Black designers and the first in more than two decades to focus on menswear, according to The Associated Press. ""I think honoring minorities, honoring Black and brown people in these spaces and outside every day, is important,"" musical artist Janelle Monáe, told the wire service. ""The ones who have dedicated their lives to this country to serve, build and give us art to sustain us for a lifetime. We should continue to honor them and push forward and stand on their shoulders."" Monáe is a member this year's Gala host committee, along with Simone Biles, Spike Lee, Ayo Edebiri, André 3000, and other public figures across sports and the arts. The museum in February revealed the event's co-chairs and host committee as well as its dress code, ""Tailored for You."" It relates to the exhibition, focusing on tailored suiting styles and menswear, but leaves room for interpretation. The 2025 Met Gala co-chairs are actor Colman Domingo, Formula I driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, hip hop impresario Pharrell Williams, and fashion icon Anna Wintour, the long-time editor-in-chief of Vogue. NBA star LeBron James is serving as an honorary chair, according to The Met. The annual benefit provides the costume department with its primary source of annual funding for exhibitions, publications, acquisitions and other operating costs. This year's event has already raised a record $31 million, according to the Met. One day before the Met Gala, a newer red-carpet event, The Debt Gala, will be held in Brooklyn. The event was founded to raise funds for organizations that help relieve medical debt for people in marginalized communities. It also has a theme: Let Them Eat Cake: Ruined Riches. Tickets cost $35.

"What to know as Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex trafficking trial starts Jury selection has started in music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex-trafficking trial. Here's what to know. 20H AGO","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex trafficking trial is underway. Here's what to know about the charges, evidence and more.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sean-diddy-combs-trial-sex-trafficking-charges-evidence/,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12. Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal. As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know. One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment. Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts — one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution — against him in early April. The indictment alleges Combs ""engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,"" which was ""verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual."" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him. The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called ""Freak Offs,"" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, ""in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,"" and sometimes lasted multiple days. Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by ""striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,"" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment. In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct. According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3. Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors. If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him. His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from ""former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships."" ""This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,"" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment. A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial. The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN obtained and published the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs. Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage. Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a ""Freak Off."" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a ""glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship"" between the two. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said. Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial. Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions. They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers. It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial. Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors. In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not ""explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury"" nor acknowledge ""the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs."" They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners. Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were ""utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury."" Elias E.

"Trump says he will impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside U.S. President Trump on Sunday announced movies as his latest target for tariffs because the U.S. movie industry ""is DYING a very fast death."" MAY 5",Trump announces he will impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-movies-tariffs-hollywood/,"President Trump on Sunday announced movies as the latest target for tariffs because the U.S. movie industry ""is DYING a very fast death."" In a Truth Social post, the president said he's authorizing the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of imposing a 100% tariffs ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands."" It wasn't immediately clear how the tariffs would be applied. Mr. Trump said the incentives that other countries are offering filmmakers and studios constitute a national security threat. ""Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,"" the president wrote. ""It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" The announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Mr. Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe. China, who has taken the brunt of the president's combative trade policies with 145% tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of U.S. films it imported. There was also no mention in Trump's social media post of television series — an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen."
Brazilian police arrest 2 in thwarted bomb plot at Lady Gaga Rio concert Organizers of a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro said the event drew more than 2 million to Copacabana Beach. MAY 5,Brazilian police arrest 2 in thwarted bomb plot at Lady Gaga Rio concert with 2 million fans,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lady-gaga-free-concert-copacabana-beach-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-two-million-fans/,"Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro. Saturday's event drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach. Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. ""The plan was treated as a 'collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,"" the police said. Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack — the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio. The concert was the biggest show of Gaga's career. ""Tonight, we're making history,"" Lady Gage told a screaming crowd. ""Thank you for making history with me."" A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told CBS News the team learned of the alleged threats through media reports. ""Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,"" the spokesperson said. ""Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place."" The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show just after 10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song ""Bloody Mary."" Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder to shoulder on the vast stretch of sand. Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show, which was funded by the city of Rio in an effort to revitalize the economy. In a recent report, Rio's City Hall said the show should bring in at least 600 million reais, or roughly $106 million. For Gaga, the performance was also an opportunity to promote her upcoming ""Mayhem Ball"" tour, featuring songs from her latest record MAYHEM. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 when it was released in early March and includes new hits like ""Abracadabra."" Lady Gaga also performed a number of older classics at her free show Saturday, including ""Poker Face"" and ""Alejandro,"" switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag. Some fans — many of them young — arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view. ""Today is the best day of my life,"" said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. ""It's surreal to be here."" Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year. The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Year's Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John's Day celebrations in June. ""It brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season — filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,"" said Osmar Lima, the city's secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall's tourism department last month. Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028. Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song ""LoveGame"" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out. While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors. More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio's City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, traveled from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show. ""I've been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,"" said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga's outlandish costumes over the years. For her, the mega-star represents ""total freedom of expression — being who one wants without shame."" Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna's show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history. To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach. Rio state's security plan included 3,300 members of the military, 1,500 police officers and 400 firefighters. Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues. Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait. ""She's the best artist in the world,"" the 25-year-old said, as chants of ""Gaga, I love you"" in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him."
"How Matisse became a name in pottery When Alex Matisse founded East Fork Pottery, in Asheville, N.C., he didn't want to use the name of his great-grandfather, artist Henri Matisse. But after business took off, Alex decided it was time – and now graces his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear. MAY 4",How Matisse became a name in pottery,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-matisse-became-a-name-in-pottery/,"As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself. ""When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,"" he said. ""We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon."" Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, ""I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me."" When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA – because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse. I asked, ""What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?"" ""He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,"" Alex replied. It was a famous last name he ran away from for years. ""I had a very grumpy relationship with it,"" he laughed. ""It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake."" Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm. I asked, ""Did she have the same passion for it that you did?"" ""No. She didn't have a passion for clay,"" Alex said. ""But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?"" ""Yeah. She stuck around,"" he laughed. And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, ""If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did."" So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors. He was excited. ""And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,"" he said. ""And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds."" And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off. Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves ""Potheads."" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars. And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect. ""We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,"" Alex said. ""But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally."" Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again. He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. ""Oh, geez. No."" Alex said, ""Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about."" Henri Matisse once famously said, ""Creativity takes courage."" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing. ""There's not a heaviness to it,"" he said. ""It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it."" For more info: Story produced by Kay Lim. Editor: Remington Korper.

"Cole Escola on the hit Broadway farce ""Oh, Mary!"" The actor-playwright received two Tony nominations for the over-the-top comedy about Mary Todd Lincoln and her secret passion of becoming a cabaret star, while her husband, Abe, is trying to win the Civil War. MAY 4","Cole Escola on the hit Broadway farce ""Oh, Mary!""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cole-escola-on-the-hit-broadway-farce-oh-mary/,"""Oh, Mary!"" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola. Abraham Lincoln: ""For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?"" Mary Todd Lincoln: ""How would it look? Sensational!!"" It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together. Abraham Lincoln: ""No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!"" Mary Todd Lincoln: ""With who?"" Abraham Lincoln: ""The south!"" Mary Todd Lincoln: ""Of what?"" It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (""Well, speak for yourself, Mo!""), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records. What does that say? ""Inflation is high,"" Escola laughed. Escola came up with the idea in 2009: ""I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?"" But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. ""I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me – to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,"" Escola said. ""There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'"" Escola eventually wrote the play. ""Oh, Mary!"" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor). It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. ""When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back."" The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. ""Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta."" I asked, ""And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?"" ""No, no,"" Escola replied. ""Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'"" ""And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?"" ""Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do."" Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, ""I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it."" Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt. I asked, ""Comedically, have you always done your own thing?"" ""Yes."" ""So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?"" ""No,"" said Escola. ""It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh."" Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (""It was New York or bust!""), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. ""I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.' ""I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you."" Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as ""Mom Commercial"" (2015): … and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like ""At Home with Amy Sedaris."" And then along came Mary. I said, ""You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'"" ""No,"" Escola said. ""There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.""

"Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's ""act of war"" 2H AGO","Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's strikes, calling them an ""act of war""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-pakistan-kashmir-strikes-sharif-revenge-modi/,"Islamabad — India fired missiles into Pakistani-controlled territory in several locations early Wednesday, killing at least 26 people including a child, in what Pakistan's leader called an act of war. India said it struck infrastructure used by militants linked to last month's massacre of tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. Pakistan said it had shot down several Indian fighter jets in retaliation as three planes fell onto villages in India-controlled Kashmir. At least seven civilians were also killed in the region by Pakistani shelling, Indian police and medics said. Tension has soared between the nuclear-armed neighbors since an attack in which gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, at a popular meadow in the disputed territory of Kashmir, in some cases killing men before their wives' eyes. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the attack, something Islamabad has denied. Kashmir, which is divided between the two countries but claimed in its entirety by each, has been at the center of tensions for decades and they have fought two wars over it. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Wednesday's airstrikes and said his country would retaliate. ""Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given,"" Sharif said. The country's National Security Committee met Wednesday morning, and Pakistan summoned India's charge d'affaires to lodge a protest. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a special meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security. A source told the Reuters news agency Modi postponed a trip to Croatia, the Netherlands and Norway. South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said it was one the highest-intensity strikes from India on its rival in years and that Pakistan's response would ""surely pack a punch as well."" ""These are two strong militaries that, even with nuclear weapons as a deterrent, are not afraid to deploy sizeable levels of conventional military force against each other,"" Kugelman said. ""The escalation risks are real. And they could well increase, and quickly."" Stephane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesperson, said in a statement late Tuesday that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint because the world could not ""afford a military confrontation"" between India and Pakistan. Several Indian states planned civil defense drills later Wednesday, according to India's home ministry, to train civilians and security personnel to respond in case of any ""hostile attacks,"" the ministry said in a statement. Such drills in India are rare in non-crisis times. Indian politicians from different political parties lauded the strikes. ""Victory to Mother India,"" India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X. India's main opposition Congress party called for national unity and said it was ""extremely proud"" of the country's army. ""We applaud their resolute resolve and courage,"" Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge said. India's army said the operation was named ""Sindoor,"" a Hindi word for the bright red vermillion powder worn by married Hindu women on their forehead and hair, referring to the women whose husbands were killed in front of them. India's missiles hit six locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country's eastern Punjab province, killing at least 26 people including women and children, said Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif. Officials said another 38 people were injured by the strikes, and another five people were killed in Pakistan during exchanges of fire across the border later in the day. Sharif said the Indian jets also damaged infrastructure at a dam in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, calling it a violation of international norms. India's Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted at least nine sites ""where terrorist attacks against India have been planned."" ""Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistan military facilities have been targeted,"" the statement said, adding that ""India has demonstrated considerable restraint."" Pakistan said the strikes hit at least two sites previously tied to banned militant groups. One hit the Subhan Mosque in Punjab's Bahawalpur city, killing 13 people including a child, according to Zohaib Ahmed, a doctor at a nearby hospital. The mosque is near a seminary that was once the central office of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group outlawed in 2002. Officials say the group has had no operational presence at the site since the ban. In a statement obtained by CBS News, Jaish-e-Mohammed's chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, claimed India's attack killed 10 of his family members and four close associates. He criticized Modi, saying, ""This cruelty has broken all limits—do not expect mercy anymore."" Another missile hit a mosque in Muridke, damaging its structure. A sprawling building located nearby served as the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba until 2013, when Pakistan banned the group and arrested its founder. Last month's attack on tourists was claimed by a group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance, which India says is also known as The Resistance Front and is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. In Muzaffarabad, the main city of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, resident Abdul Sammad said he heard several explosions as the blast ripped through houses. He saw people running in panic and authorities immediately cut power to the area. People took refuge on the streets and in open areas, fearful of what might happen. ""We were afraid the next missile might hit our house,"" said Mohammad Ashraf. Chaudhry Ghulam Rasool, who lives near the mosque, told CBS News, ""We were just about to go to bed when a huge blast happened. It was very big and terrifying explosions."" Along the Line of Control, which divides the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan, there were heavy exchanges of fire. The Indian police and medics said seven civilians were killed and 30 wounded by Pakistani shelling in Poonch district near the highly militarized Line of Control, the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir between the two countries. Officials said several homes also were damaged in the shelling. The Indian army said Pakistani troops ""resorted to arbitrary firing,"" including gunfire and artillery shelling, across the frontier. Shortly after India's strikes, aircraft fell onto three villages in India-controlled Kashmir. Sharif, the Pakistani military spokesperson, said the country's air force shot down five Indian jets in retaliation for the strikes. There was no immediate comment from India about Pakistan's claim. Debris from a plane was scattered across Wuyan village in the outskirts of the region's main city, including in a school and a mosque compound, according to Srinagar police and residents. Firefighters struggled for hours to douse the resulting fires. ""There was a huge fire in the sky. Then we heard several blasts also,"" said Mohammed Yousuf Dar, a Wuyan resident. Another aircraft fell in an open field in Bhardha Kalan village, near the Line of Control in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Village resident Sachin Kumar told The Associated Press he heard massive blasts followed by a huge ball of fire. Kumar said he and and several other villagers rushed to the scene and found two pilots with injuries. Both were later taken away by the Indian army. A third aircraft crashed in a farm field in India's northern Punjab state, a police office told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The officer did not provide further details. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, President Trump called the strikes ""a shame."" ""We just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They've been fighting for a long time. You know, they've been fighting for many many decades, and centuries actually, if you really think about it. No, I just hope it ends very quickly."" China called for restraint from both sides following India's strikes. ""China expresses regret over India's military actions this morning and is concerned about the current developments. China opposes all forms of terrorism,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in a statement. ""We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritize peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation."" Beijing is the largest investor in Pakistan by far, with a $65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project that spans across the country. China meanwhile also has multiple border claims disputed with India, with one of those claims in the northeastern part of the Kashmir region. French news agency AFP reports that British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio Wednesday the UK is ""a friend, a partner to both countries. We stand ready to support both countries. Both have a huge interest in regional stability, in dialogue, in de-escalation and anything we can do to support that, we are here and willing to do."" Moscow on Wednesday called for both India and Pakistan to show ""restraint,"" AFP says."
When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? 1H AGO,When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? Here's how long it's taken to see white smoke in the past,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conclave-2025-when-will-cardinals-replace-pope-francis/,"It's nearing decision time for the most senior members of the Catholic Church. The 133 cardinal electors due to choose a successor to the late Pope Francis gathered for a final Mass on Wednesday morning, just hours before they were to launch the secretive, centuries-old ritual known as the conclave to pick a new pontiff. Later Wednesday, the electors will be locked inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, where they will hold as many rounds of voting as prove necessary to select the next leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take. The conclave begins on Wednesday — 16 days after Pope Francis' death. It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years. In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials. The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices. The 133 electors participating this time around can hold one round of voting in the afternoon of the first day of the conclave, which consists of two ballots. To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day. From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options. There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved. The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The longest conclave on record took nearly three years. The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long — about 1,000 days — that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision. That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope — ""conclave,"" which translates to ""under lock and key"" — came from. After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271. There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history. The last three popes have been elected in two or three days. In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots. Vatican watcher John Allen, the editor of the Catholic news outlet Crux, believes this conclave may well follow that pattern, and we could expect a new pope to be named by the end of the week. After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected, black smoke rises from the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises. Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting. White smoke was first used in 1914, when Cardinals decided the light colored smoke should announce the selection of a new pope, Georgtown University reported. Now, to ensure the result of each ballot is clear, chemicals are burned alongside the ballots in each round to color the smoke black or white. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"For second time in 8 days, fighter jet assigned to USS Truman is lost in Red Sea 7H AGO","For second time in 8 days, U.S. fighter jet assigned to USS Truman is lost in Red Sea",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-fighter-jet-assigned-to-uss-truman-lost-red-sea-second-time/,"For the second time in just over a week, an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea, a defense official confirmed to CBS News. The two pilots aboard the aircraft sustained minor injuries in the ordeal. The official said in a statement that the Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman Tuesday ""when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard."" An arrestment is the mechanism that a carrier uses to safely slow down and halt a fighter jet as it lands. ""Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 11,"" the official said. ""The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries. No flight deck personnel were injured."" On April 28, a Super Hornet was being towed in the Truman hangar bay when crews lost control of the aircraft and it went overboard, along with the tow tractor. One sailor suffered minor injuries in the incident. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that initial reports suggested the jet may have fallen overboard after the carrier turned sharply while taking evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants. Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said in statement that the Super Hornet that went into the Red Sea Tuesday ""was not struck by the Houthis."" The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since it deployed to the Middle East in September 2024. In December, the USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 which had taken off from the Truman. The two-person crew were able to safely eject. In February, the Truman accidentally collided with a merchant vessel near the Suez Canal. Also Tuesday, President Trump disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to a deal that would see them halt their attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. Those attacks started in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. Eleanor Watson is a CBS News multi-platform reporter and producer covering the Pentagon."
Trump wants the Fed to cut rates today. Will it oblige? 16H AGO,Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will Jerome Powell oblige?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-rate-cut-jerome-powell-may-7-fomc-meeting/,"President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been ""TOO LATE AND WRONG"" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision — but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction. The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty — costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out. ""The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,"" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email. He added, ""The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer."" Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7. The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day. Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. ""Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response — neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,"" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note. Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists. Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting. However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes. But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer. ""We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,"" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December. Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked. On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is ""NO INFLATION"" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon. But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined — gas costs are down 10% from a year ago — continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say. ""There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,"" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. ""No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates."" Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates. ""Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,"" he noted. ""When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards."" Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.

What U.S. Catholics are looking for in the next pope — CBS News poll 12H AGO,New pope could be elected in days. Here's what U.S. Catholics are looking for — CBS News poll,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-us-catholics-look-to-next-pope/,"In the eyes of U.S. Catholics, the next pope is going to have big — if not red — shoes to fill. Most say the Church is in touch with the needs of Catholics, a view that's higher today than when Pope Francis (who famously wore simple black shoes) became pontiff in 2013. Just before Francis' papacy, which today gets 76% approval, most U.S. Catholics said the Church was out of touch. As such, many U.S. Catholics would see the next pope continue Francis' teachings, and others would move toward still more progressive ones. Those who'd continue Francis' teachings tend to be younger. And by two to one, more U.S. Catholics overall say Francis' papacy left them feeling more connected to the Church than less. While most say it doesn't matter where the next pope comes from, plenty of U.S. Catholics — if given a choice — would like the next Pope to come from the U.S., their top choice out of other countries or regions. Hispanic Americans — who make up a third of US Catholics — also favor the U.S., but South America, Mexico and Central America are also noted. Most also want the next pope to be outspoken on world political issues. What kinds of changes are Catholics looking for? Most U.S. Catholics would look for a pope who is in favor of letting priests marry; of letting women be ordained as priests; and — overwhelmingly — for the use of birth control. But here again there are differences between the (smaller group of) regular churchgoers, and the larger group of U.S. Catholics who rarely or never go. These majority views are driven much more by the latter group, who also say the Church is out of touch with Catholics' needs — which may be one reason they'd seek a new pope in favor of changes such as these. Most U.S. Catholics want the next pope to continue to prioritize tradition in general, even as some specific things draw calls for change. And they have at least some confidence (if not a great deal) the conclave will choose a pope in touch with the needs of Catholics — this view is especially the case among the most frequent attendees. Those who think the Church is currently out of touch have comparably less confidence that the conclave will pick a pope who is. But the next pope will oversee a U.S. Catholic laity with some pronounced differences in views between a smaller group who say they attend Mass at least a few times per month — most of whom do think the Church is in touch — and a majority who say they attend only a few times a year or never, and think the Church is out of touch. And U.S. Catholics say they'll be paying attention. Most plan to follow news about the process and selection of a pope at least somewhat closely. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,298 adult Catholics living in the U.S. interviewed between April 30-May 5, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and Mass attendance according to the 2023-24 Pew Religious Landscape Study. The margin of error is ±3.8 points.

Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's industry ties 10H AGO,Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's ties to the industry,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-genius-act-stablecoin-crypto-bill-trump/,"Washington — Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday ""we need to start moving forward."" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. ""Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,"" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, ""Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption."" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. ""Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately."" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's ""serious risks"" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."" ""Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,"" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the ""single largest-ever investment in a crypto company"" and sets a ""historic precedent."" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

"HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program 11H AGO","HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-revokes-some-layoff-notices-including-to-911-program/,"The Department of Health and Human Services formally revoked some layoff notices on Tuesday, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, restoring some staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Tuesday's letters to laid-off workers notifying them that their employment was being restored went a step further from some previous reinstatements touted by department officials, which often amounted only to a request for civil servants to continue working for a few more weeks to wind down or prepare to hand off their assignments. ""You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) upcoming reduction in force (RIF). That notice is hereby revoked,"" read the letter received by some workers at the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides health care services to 9/11 first responders and survivors. A move last week to cut 15 employees of the 9/11 program, as part of a larger wave of eliminations that gutted most of the work from the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, prompted outcry from New York lawmakers. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. denied cutting the World Trade Center Health Program or NIOSH, which he said are slated to be merged into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America. ""Those programs were not terminated, as the media has reported. But they've simply been consolidated into a place that makes more sense,"" Kennedy said. Some of the FDA's laboratories also received notices Tuesday that they would be formally brought back to work as of Wednesday. Employees of the FDA's food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco all received notices that their layoffs were being reversed, though cuts to probationary workers in the labs have so far not been walked back. Letters to those scientists told them that their previous layoff notices were ""officially RESCINDED"" and that they would be expected to return to work on Wednesday. Not all of the workers that Kennedy or his department have promised to bring back to work have received notices restoring their jobs. Two other labs at the FDA — drug safety scientists in Puerto Rico and Detroit — have so far not received letters, multiple laid-off employees in the labs said. Employees of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health also remain off the job. Kennedy had said a month ago that he would restore the lead poisoning experts in the center, saying that some of the layoffs could have been mistakes. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details on which teams were cut and which were being brought back. Tuesday's move to reverse some layoffs at HHS comes days after the department laid off hundreds more employees at the National Institutes of Health, blindsiding staff who had survived the initial wave of cuts in April. Layoffs included staff at the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Library of Medicine and Office of Research Facilities, two people said. NIH employees were told that the additional cuts were prompted by a need to reinstate scientists while also meeting strict layoff quotas sought by the department.

Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza 9H AGO,Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-less-than-2-dozen-hostages-believed-to-be-alive-in-gaza/,"President Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. ""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. ""There's 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,"" Mr. Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition."
"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say","Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-may-soon-deport-migrants-to-libya/,"The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans. Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

5 charged after migrant boat capsized off San Diego coast,5 charged after migrant boat capsizes off San Diego; Noem asks DOJ for death penalty,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-migrant-boat-human-smuggling/,"Five Mexican nationals are facing charges after a small boat carrying more than a dozen people capsized off the coast of San Diego, killing three passengers, including a 14-year-old boy from India, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of California announced Tuesday. The boy's parents and two others were hospitalized following the human smuggling event, prosecutors confirmed in a news release. Nine other migrants were missing from the boat and were presumed dead, but authorities later located eight of them in Chula Vista, nearly 30 miles away from Del Mar, where the boat was found. A 10-year-old Indian girl, the boy's sister, remains missing, prosecutors said. ""The drowning deaths of these children are a heartbreaking reminder of how little human traffickers care about the costs of their deadly business,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said in a statement. U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday that there were originally 16 individuals on board, some of whom remain missing. Jesus Ivan Rodriguez-Leyva and Julio Cesar Zuniga-Luna were arrested on Monday at the beach where the overturned boat washed ashore, according to prosecutors. They were charged with Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Bringing in Aliens for Financial Gain, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday night announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty. ""Their deaths were not only avoidable but were also the direct result of the greed and indifference of smugglers who exploited them,"" Noem said in a statement, in part. ""Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, alien smuggling acts that result in death are capital crimes punishable by death. And under the Federal Death Penalty Act, those who intentionally participate in conduct knowing that it could result in the loss of life may be eligible for capital punishment."" Prosecutors said three other suspects — Melissa Jennelle Cota, Gustavo Lara and Sergio Rojas-Fregoso — were arrested late Monday night after Border Patrol agents in Chula Vista identified a vehicle seen at a beach in Del Mar and investigated. While the driver of said vehicle fled, officers located two other vehicles involved and found the missing migrants, according to prosecutors. Cota, Lara and Rojas-Fregoso were charged with Transportation of Illegal Aliens. Prosecutors said Rojas-Fregoso had been previously deported on Dec. 19, 2023. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. It was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles north of the Mexico border, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told The Associated Press. He said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. In 2023, eight people were killed when two boats capsized off the San Diego coast. Kiki Intarasuwan is a news editor for CBS News & Stations."
Young boy gains perspective well beyond his years after tornado,"A young boy lost his home in a tornado. One year later, he's gained perspective well beyond his years.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-boy-lost-home-oklahoma-tornado-gained-perspective/,"Bartlesville, Oklahoma — A year after a tornado flattened his family's home, 9-year-old River Garrett isn't focused on what was lost — but on what can still be built. ""Rebuilding, it takes a while, it takes hard work. But to me, it's putting something back together where it is better than before,"" River said, outside his grandmother's brand new home in northern Oklahoma. On May 6, 2024, a powerful tornado tore across the area, killing two people and causing $25 million in damage. River's family survived, but their ranch was leveled. Tornado activity like what River lived through has significantly increased. In the first four months of 2025, there were 670 tornado reports and 35 deaths in the U.S. — more than a 43% jump in storms compared to the decade before, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. River's family is still sorting through the bits and pieces they were able to recover, but they consider themselves lucky. In Barnsdall, the next town over, Mayor Johnny Kelley said only 5% of his community has been rebuilt since the last time CBS News visited. But River, though just 8 at the time, seemed to understand the reality that others had it worse off than him. ""And I said to myself that I can't make this about me,"" River told CBS News back then. One year later, River has a new room and some old things that survived the tornado. He hopes to cover the walls with Michael Jackson pictures and records. ""I love my room, too. I was blown away when I saw my room, and I love it,"" River said. When asked how he's changed since the tornado, River said, ""I think I'm more aware of little things that can turn into big things. But I don't always worry about that."" ""I don't sweat unless it gets bigger over time, like the tornado did,"" he added. It's a reminder that even after unimaginable loss, a little perspective can help you heal.

Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-less-than-2-dozen-hostages-believed-to-be-alive-in-gaza/,"President Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. ""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. ""There's 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,"" Mr. Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition."
"HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program","HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-revokes-some-layoff-notices-including-to-911-program/,"The Department of Health and Human Services formally revoked some layoff notices on Tuesday, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, restoring some staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Tuesday's letters to laid-off workers notifying them that their employment was being restored went a step further from some previous reinstatements touted by department officials, which often amounted only to a request for civil servants to continue working for a few more weeks to wind down or prepare to hand off their assignments. ""You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) upcoming reduction in force (RIF). That notice is hereby revoked,"" read the letter received by some workers at the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides health care services to 9/11 first responders and survivors. A move last week to cut 15 employees of the 9/11 program, as part of a larger wave of eliminations that gutted most of the work from the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, prompted outcry from New York lawmakers. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. denied cutting the World Trade Center Health Program or NIOSH, which he said are slated to be merged into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America. ""Those programs were not terminated, as the media has reported. But they've simply been consolidated into a place that makes more sense,"" Kennedy said. Some of the FDA's laboratories also received notices Tuesday that they would be formally brought back to work as of Wednesday. Employees of the FDA's food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco all received notices that their layoffs were being reversed, though cuts to probationary workers in the labs have so far not been walked back. Letters to those scientists told them that their previous layoff notices were ""officially RESCINDED"" and that they would be expected to return to work on Wednesday. Not all of the workers that Kennedy or his department have promised to bring back to work have received notices restoring their jobs. Two other labs at the FDA — drug safety scientists in Puerto Rico and Detroit — have so far not received letters, multiple laid-off employees in the labs said. Employees of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health also remain off the job. Kennedy had said a month ago that he would restore the lead poisoning experts in the center, saying that some of the layoffs could have been mistakes. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details on which teams were cut and which were being brought back. Tuesday's move to reverse some layoffs at HHS comes days after the department laid off hundreds more employees at the National Institutes of Health, blindsiding staff who had survived the initial wave of cuts in April. Layoffs included staff at the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Library of Medicine and Office of Research Facilities, two people said. NIH employees were told that the additional cuts were prompted by a need to reinstate scientists while also meeting strict layoff quotas sought by the department.

Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit,"Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit to ""Make America Film Again""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-gavin-newsom-film-tariffs-tax-credit/,"President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit. ""California built the film industry — and we're ready to bring even more jobs home. We've proven what strong state incentives can do,"" Newsom's post on X said. ""Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again."" His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was ""DYING a very fast death."" The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels. Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit from $330 million to $750 million. Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027. Mr. Trump said the American film industry has been ""decimated"" by other countries and the ""grossly incompetent"" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to ""abandon"" the U.S. But he vowed that ""we'll get it back."" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to ""make sure they're happy with"" the prospective tariffs. The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?"" Mr. Trump said. ""That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built."" Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage. ""And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,"" he said. He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California. ""I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,"" The president visited Los Angeles in late-January, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. ""I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. ""I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation."" Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor. ""I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,"" he said.

Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-u-s-bicycle-company-kent-international-halts-imports-from-china/,"The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations. ""When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,"" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. ""And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees."" Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream. About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs. During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone. Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold. He says that makes him feel ""really bad"" and ""angry."" ""China is not paying these tariffs,"" Arnold said. ""We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted."" The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May. Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile. ""We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,"" Kramer said. ""And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair."" Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective. ""I can't even calculate that high,"" Kramer said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. ""I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example…I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.""

These Chinese-made products could soon be hard to find in the U.S. A sharp drop in Chinese imports could lead to shortages of the following consumer products. 16H AGO,These Chinese-made products could soon be hard to find in the U.S.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinese-china-products-tariffs-shortages-us/,"Shipments of Chinese goods to the U.S. are plunging, auguring potential supply-chain disruptions that could empty store shelves as early as this summer, some experts have warned. As U.S. tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports take hold, supplies of a broad range of products could start to dwindle later this summer as back-to-school and holiday spending heat up. Experts warn that the sharp decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. or elsewhere that use materials or inputs from China. Many American retailers rushed to build up their inventories ahead of President Trump's sweeping levies, leading to a recent spike in imports. Imports have since slowed, with a number of retailers foregoing orders on apparel, baby goods and other items that would typically be headed toward U.S. ports. ""Once this pull-forward effect fades, U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls and restocking challenges, especially for back-to-school and holiday goods,"" analysts with investment bank TD Cowen wrote in a research note that assessed the impact of tariffs on supply chains. ""Companies and products with high exposure to China and its manufacturing are most at risk of shortages,"" they added. The types of goods whose supplies were pulled forward as companies stocked up include computers, cars, cell phones and electric storage batteries, according to the financial firm. The financial firm cited data from the Port of Los Angeles, which along with the Port of Long Beach receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia. Following the pre-tariff spike in imports, container bookings from China to the U.S. have gone down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company. So-called ""blank sailings,"" or canceled voyages to the Port of Los Angeles rose to 17 in May, from just six in the month of April, TD Cowen found. There is a wide range of goods that U.S.-based sellers import from China and that are most at risk of becoming scarce because of the trade war. ""Among them, toys stand out as particularly vulnerable, raising concerns about potential shortages during the critical holiday season,"" TD Cowen analysts noted. Here are some products from China that could soon be hard to come by in the U.S. as a result of tariffs, according to TD Cowen's analysis. Down feathers: The U.S. imports $1.9 billion in down feathers from China. That amounts to 77% of the country's total imported supply of down. Down is commonly used for insulation in comforters and outerwear. Toys, games and sports equipment: More than $30 billion in toys, games and sports equipment sold in the U.S. is imported from China. That accounts for just over 73% of the country's total imports in the category. The trade war could spell shortages in children's toys come Christmastime, experts, as well as President Trump, have warned. Textile art: The U.S. imports $8.6 billion in textile art from China. That accounts for over half of all the textile art the country imports from abroad. Footwear: The U.S. is highly reliant on China for shoes. It imports $9.8 billion's worth, or 36% of footwear sold stateside. Sportswear giant Adidas for one, has warned that it expects to raise prices for U.S. customers because of tariffs. Cutlery: Dinner utensils manufactured in China could also start becoming scarce. The U.S. imports $3.1 billion in cutlery and metal tools from the country. Glassware: Almost 30% of U.S. imports of glassware and other products made of glass comes from China. Furniture and bedding: $18.5 billion's worth of furniture and bedding comes from China. That's 28% of all U.S. imports in the category. Apparel: $17.3 billion's worth of apparel is imported from China. That includes knit or crocheted clothing (almost $10 billion) and not-knit apparel ($7.3 billion). Beyond higher costs for consumer goods, businesses in a range of industries could face other tariff-related challenges, TD Cowen found. For example, the U.S. imports $124 billion in electric machinery; $82 billion in nuclear reactors, boilers and other machinery; $12 billion in goods made of iron or steel; and $19.3 billion in plastics from China each year, according to data from the International Trade Administration.

Flying without a Real ID? Here's what to know at the airport 13H AGO,Flying without a Real ID? Here's what to know at the airport,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/real-id-flying-airport-what-to-know/,"It's a nightmare for any traveler: getting to the airport and not having their ID. For many Americans, a version of that headache will become a reality starting Wednesday when the federal government begins enforcing requirements for Real ID, a national set of standards for state-issued identification documents such as driver's licenses. The Transportation Security Administration said that starting Wednesday, it will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID requirements. ""TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimize operational disruptions at airports,"" Adam Stahl, a TSA senior official who's performing the duties of the agency's administrator, said in a statement last month. The agency said people who are in the U.S. illegally and are voluntarily self-deporting on international flights will still be allowed to board planes. Five states — Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington — issue enhanced IDs, which can be used to cross the U.S. border in a vehicle. The TSA said enhanced IDs are an acceptable form of identification at airport checkpoints. According to the TSA, 81% of travelers provide an acceptable ID at security checkpoints. But a CBS News data analysis in April found that at least 17 states were less than 50% compliant with Real ID requirements, and 30 states were less than 70% compliant, setting the stage for potential disruptions at checkpoints across the country. There is hope for people who don't have an updated driver's license, state ID card or enhanced ID. The TSA said other forms of identification can be shown at checkpoints. Here's a list of those other acceptable IDs: The TSA noted that the list is subject to change without notice. The agency also said temporary driver's licenses aren't an acceptable form of ID. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday told lawmakers what will happen when passengers present their ID to a TSA officer. ""If it's not compliant, they may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step, but people will be allowed to fly,"" Noem told a House Appropriations subcommittee. ""We will make sure that it is as seamless as possible and that travelers will get to stay on their intended itinerary, but we are telling people that this law will be enforced."" The TSA said people without an acceptable ID may have to have their identity verified by providing information such as their name and current address. Passengers with confirmed identities may then be subjected to additional screening. People without confirmed identities won't be allowed to go through security. Last month, a source familiar with the procedure told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that the identity verification process is similar to what happens when people have their ID stolen on vacation. People who intend to have their identity verified at the airport should plan to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight instead of the recommended two hours, according to the source. The goal will be to move people with noncompliant IDs to a separate area quickly so security lines don't get backed up, the source told Van Cleave. A Real ID card has a star marking at the upper-right part of the card, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The TSA doesn't require children under 18 to have an ID when traveling within the U.S. The agency urges passengers to check if their airline requires IDs for children.

Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will it oblige? 16H AGO,Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will Jerome Powell oblige?,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-rate-cut-jerome-powell-may-7-fomc-meeting/,"President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been ""TOO LATE AND WRONG"" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision — but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction. The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty — costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out. ""The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,"" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email. He added, ""The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer."" Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7. The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day. Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. ""Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response — neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,"" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note. Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists. Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting. However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes. But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer. ""We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,"" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December. Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked. On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is ""NO INFLATION"" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon. But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined — gas costs are down 10% from a year ago — continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say. ""There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,"" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. ""No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates."" Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates. ""Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,"" he noted. ""When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards."" Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.

Grand Theft Auto 6 drops a surprise second trailer. Here are all the details. 16H AGO,Grand Theft Auto 6 drops a surprise second trailer. Here are all the details.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gta-6-trailer-2-release-grand-theft-auto-rockstar-vice-city/,"Grand Theft Auto 6 has dropped a surprise second trailer just days after Rockstar Games said it's pushing back the game's much-anticipated release until May 2026. The second trailer provides more details about the game's storyline, which involves its first-ever female protagonist, Lucia. The roughly 3-minute clip shows her partner, Jason, as he meets her when she's released from prison. The two are shown engaging in some criminal activities, such as holding up a business while wearing masks and carrying weapons. ""Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,"" states Rockstar's description for the second trailer. ""But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."" The game, known as GTA to fans, had originally been slated for a 2025 release, but Rockstar said last week that it would push that back to May 26, 2026. Fans have already been waiting more than a decade for a new title, with the most recent version of the game, GTA 5, released in 2013. With GTA 5 having sold more than 200 million copies, expectations are high for GTA 6, with Wedbush Securities forecasting sales of $6.35 billion in sales for fiscal year 2026. The second trailer, which was released about 17 months after the game's first trailer, introduces more of the backstory between its main characters, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Jason is described as growing up ""around grifters and crooks,"" but after some time in the Army, he moved to the Keys to work for local drug runners. Lucia, meanwhile, ended up in the Leonida Penitentiary after ""fighting for her family,"" the website says. Other characters include Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, and Boobie Ike, who has used his street smarts to build a business empire including ""real estate, a strip club and a recording studio,"" the site says. Along with the trailer, Rockstar Games also released new screenshots of the game on its website, featuring new characters and a number of locations, including Vice City — the fictional city inspired by Miami — and Leonida Keys, which bears a resemblance to the Florida Keys. ""Literally the best graphics I've ever seen,"" wrote YouTuber Jake Randall on X about the new trailer.

Flowers for Mother's Day may be more expensive due to Trump's tariffs 13H AGO,Flowers for Mother's Day may be more expensive due to Trump's tariffs,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flower-prices-mothers-day-trump-tariffs/,"With Mother's Day approaching, you may be looking to buy a bouquet of flowers — and prices could be higher due to tariffs enacted by President Trump. ""We're going to do the best we can to sort of keep those prices where they need to be. But people can definitely expect to be paying a little bit more,"" said Jody Costello, a florist in Royal Oak, Michigan. While Mr. Trump paused hefty tariffs he announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere. Last year, the U.S. imported $2.2 billion worth of cut flowers and greenery, the bulk of which came from Colombia and Ecuador, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. ""The fact that they can grow year-round gave them a natural advantage,"" said Kate Penn, CEO of the Society of American Florists. Penn said domestically, small growers — many of whom have an acre or less — have flourished since the COVID-19 pandemic, selling at farmers' markets and to a blossoming wedding industry. ""The consumer does want to buy local, especially brides,"" she said. ""They love to be able to have local flowers featured."" But even small growers like Moonshot Farm in East Windsor, New Jersey, aren't immune to the fallout from tariffs. Moonshot Farm owner Rebecca Kutzer-Rice said some of the bulbs she uses to grow flowers are imported from Italy and Holland. She just received her first few shipments to be hit with the 10% tariffs. ""We're estimating it could cost our small business anywhere from $40,000 to $50,000 a year, which for a small farm is almost the equivalent of like a salary of another employee,"" she said. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers. Mistine Boren, a florist in Austin, Texas, told CBS affiliate CBS19, she's waiting until after Mother's Day to decide if she'll raise prices. ""It's tough,"" she said. ""Our margins are so thin already, and especially when it comes to buying fresh flowers, it's a big splurge and expense for people."" Boren said she's also trying to source more wild, local flowers to avoid the tariffs. Consumers may just need to be a little more flexible about what types of flowers they buy, but they can still get quality bouquets, Penn said. ""There literally are countless substitutions and florists are just masters at creating something that's still gonna make a big impact,"" she said. Nicole Brown Chau contributed to this report."
"Social Security to cut overpayment clawbacks to 50%, down from 100% MAY 5","Social Security to reduce overpayment clawbacks to 50%, down from 100%",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-overpayment-clawback-change-50-percent-doge/,"The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries. In an April 25 ""emergency message"" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%. The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment. The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to ""properly safeguard taxpayer funds."" The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration. The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary. ""SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,"" the inspector general said in a report. Last year, the Biden administration capped the clawback rate at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March. Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left too financially strapped to afford rent, food and other basics. Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. One SSA report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month. ""While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,"" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch. He added, ""A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions"" with the 50% clawback rate. The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according to KFF. Under the new rule, the 50% clawback for overpayments started April 25, according to the SSA's statement.

"Tariffs could put them under, some small business owners say MAY 5","Tariffs could put them under, some small business owners say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariff-small-businesses-future-jeopardy-price-hikes/,"Uncertainty around President Trump's ever-changing tariff agenda is already hitting small businesses hard, and threatening their very survival, operators say. With baseline 10% taxes on all imported goods in effect and country-based levies looming, business operations have become significantly more challenging for the U.S.' nearly 35 million smaller enterprises, owners told CBS MoneyWatch. One of the most pressing challenges they face? Setting prices high enough to absorb the cost of new duties on imports without driving customers away. Thirty percent of small business owners surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business in March said they planned to increase prices — the greatest share reported over the past year, an analysis by the Joint Economic Committee found. Raising prices is one way to offset rising costs, while trimming expenses — including by reducing labor costs — is the other alternative. Employment at small businesses with fewer than 10 employees declined by 3% — or 366,400 jobs — since President Trump took office, the JEC found. That compares with a 1.2% increase in hiring by small businesses in the first months of President Biden's term, and a 0.1% decrease in the first months of President Trump's first term, the JEC found. Shayai Lucero, owner of Earth and Sky Floral Designs, a small floral design business in Laguna, New Mexico, said she imports a high volume of flowers from Canada, Columbia Ecuador and Peru. Because she's located in the desert, local farms and gardens can't produce flowers year-round. Lucero recently experienced what she called ""the sharpest price increase"" she's seen in her 16 years in the flower business, when the price of a single rose went from between 65 cents to 84 cents per stem to a range of $1.89 to $2.44. ""We received emails from several different farms we work with that said after Mother's Day the tariff prices are going to go into effect,"" Lucero told CBS MoneyWatch. She's increased her prices as a result, with wrist corsages typically sold for $40, now priced at $50. ""That's not nearly enough of what I should have charged, but because my clientele is not wealthy, I had to take that into account if would people purchase from me or would they go elsewhere?"" said Lucero, adding that as her own costs skyrocket, the future of her business is uncertain. ""I have been transparent with customers to try to get them to understand, but if it gets to be too much, I may have to close,"" she said. ""This is a whole different atmosphere."" Few businesses are immune to tariffs, but smaller establishments, which tend to operate on thin margins, are among the most vulnerable. Some bigger businesses imported goods ahead of tariffs going into effect, stockpiling inventory. With less cash on hand, small businesses did not have the same ability. ""Small business owners are innovative, driven and scrappy — they often operate on razor-thin margins and are constantly finding new ways to grow,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement. ""But President Trump's tariffs are needlessly causing immense uncertainty for small business owners, forcing them to make layoffs, increase prices for their customers and even close their doors,"" she added. Mike Roach, who co-owns Paloma Clothing, a 50-year-old womenswear store in Portland, Oregon, sells labels that are primarily manufactured in India and China. He placed orders for a new season's worth of merchandise three to five months ago, before tariffs on either country were in effect. Today, tariffs as high as 145% apply to goods from China, while a 10% baseline levy is in place on goods entering the U.S. from India. ""The companies we deal with are going through conniptions trying to figure out what they're going to do. At that level, Chinese goods, are pretty much unsaleable,"" he said. ""That's a huge threat to the future of our business."" Roach hopes his store's 50th year in business isn't its last, but it's a potential reality he's facing. ""This is the worst and most uncertain situation we've ever been in,"" he said. ""This is way worse than anything else in terms of not knowing what to do and what the future is going to hold because of the uncertain factor.""

"IRS has lost 31% of its auditors after DOGE cuts, report says MAY 5","The IRS has lost almost one-third of its tax auditors after 2 months of DOGE cuts, report says",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/irs-doge-cuts-layoffs-31-percent-auditors-tax-revenue-impact/,"The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, said on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts ""in addressing waste and fraud"" will ""get the country back on track."" The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found. But revenue agents — the IRS workers who perform audits — have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say. ""You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,"" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS. She added, ""You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing."" Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, ""The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve."" The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report. While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors. Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called ""probationary workers,"" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said. Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said. And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing. The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added. The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department. DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service. DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said. The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab. ""The argument from DOGE is to save money — that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,"" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction ""simply doesn't make sense,"" she said.

The Real ID deadline is approaching fast. Here's what to know. MAY 5,The Real ID deadline is just around the corner. Here's what to know.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/real-id-deadline-may-7-tsa/,"The Real ID deadline is rapidly approaching. Americans will be required to switch to the enhanced form of identification by Wednesday, May 7, if they want to travel by plane domestically. If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance. An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%. Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline. The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner. The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear. Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport. Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities — including TSA checkpoints — enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification. That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license. The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government ""set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009. You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website. Five states — Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont — issue what is called an Enhanced Driver's License (EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card. Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word ""Enhanced"" at the top of the card. Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically. Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport — something you can't do with a regular Real ID. Prices vary by state. In New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a ""one-time $30 Real ID fee"" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs. It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs. Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID. Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments. A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security. TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification. ""We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,"" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia. If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards. No. You will still need a valid passport to travel outside of the country and go on international cruises.

"Tracking rising cost of cars, trucks, groceries ahead of Trump's tariffs CBS News is tracking the rising cost of products most impacted by tariffs imposed and soon-to-be-imposed by President Trump, from grocery items to cars and trucks. APR 2","As Trump announces new tariffs, here's a price tracker for cars, groceries and more supplies",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-price-tracker/,"CBS News is tracking the already sharply rising cost of products most impacted by tariffs imposed and new ones announced by President Trump on April 2, from the cost of common grocery items to the the purchase and operation of cars and trucks. We will continue updating the weekly prices of groceries and the monthly costs of new vehicles, used vehicles, parts, repairs, insurance premiums and construction and manufacturing raw materials. Economists and other experts say consumers can expect to see higher prices for imported items targeted by the latest round of tariffs in the coming weeks and months. Perhaps the most impacted day-to-day purchases for American families will be at the grocery store, where a large share of our most commonly purchased fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico, Canada, China and other countries facing tariffs. Experts suggest the cost of those tariffs will be passed on to consumers in the grocery checkout lane. We examined the prices for fruits, vegetables and juices that are primarily imported from other countries, according to USDA data. The average prices are drawn from weekly surveys that the Agriculture Department conducts at hundreds of stores across the country. We've tracked the weekly price data from 2020 through last week. The cost of owning and operating a car or truck in the United States is a major focus ahead of the threatened White House tariffs on vehicles manufactured in other countries — a change experts predict will add thousands more to the cost of ownership, parts, repairs and insurance. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, supply-chain interruptions and the inflation that followed, the price of buying new and used cars rose sharply. So did the cost of parts, repairs and insurance. The charts show the price as an index — the percentage above a baseline. For new and used vehicles, we're using an example of a small SUV to translate the percentages into dollars to explain the recent years' change. Used car prices spiked after the COVID pandemic because major supply chain disruptions and a global computer chip shortage severely slowed down new vehicle production. In some cases, late-model used vehicle prices soared to nearly the same as new models of the same or similar vehicles. Some of the same phenomenon drove up the price of auto parts, and consequently, consumers' bills at repair shops. In addition to the rising cost of repairs, labor shortages, driving habits and increasing crash trends have driven up the cost of automobile insurance premiums, aggravating the total cost of owning and operating personal cars and trucks. Baked into the cost of everything from homebuilding to the manufacture of durable goods like appliances are the cost of core supplies like steel and aluminum, which are also targeted by the administration's tariffs.

"Americans fear going broke in retirement more than death, study finds Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying. APR 23","Americans are more scared of going broke in retirement than they are of death, study finds",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-retirement-death-savings-allianz/,"Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death. That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death. ""It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,"" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022. Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances. Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire. ""Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,"" said LaVigne. Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement. Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said. Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency. LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. ""You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,"" he said.

"Here's the magic number Americans say they need for retirement Americans have big financial goals for what they think they'll need for a comfortable retirement, a new survey finds. APR 18",How much money do you need to retire? Here's what Americans say is their magic number.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-savings-how-much-do-you-need-magic-number/,"Whether you're fast approaching retirement or have decades to prepare, the question of how much to save can be daunting. Yet Americans have a goal in mind for what's needed to finance a comfortable retirement: $1.26 million. That's according to a new study by Northwestern Mutual, which surveyed more than 4,500 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. While $1.26 million may seem unattainable to many, it represents a scaled-down ambition from last year's survey, when workers pegged their ideal retirement needs at $1.46 million. The reason for the scaled-down financial goal comes down to cooling inflation, which has tempered workers' expectations for their retirement needs, researchers at Northwestern Mutual said. Since touching a pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has gradually eased, dropping last month to 2.4% on an annual basis. ""The inflation rate has been falling, and we're starting to see people's expectations for retirement savings soften, too,"" said Melinda Wilke, a wealth management advisor at Northwestern Mutual. But that's not to say inflation has disappeared from the equation altogether. ""Obviously a reduced inflation rate is good news,"" said David John, a senior policy advisor at AARP. ""But we are still seeing many people who are very concerned that prices are going to continue to go up, and what that means for how long their retirement savings will last."" John added that concern about the fate of the Social Security program — which currently provides monthly payments to more than 70 million Americans — is top of mind for many Americans the nonprofit works with. Even after years of saving, a majority say they're worried they could still come up short in retirement. Fifty–one percent of those surveyed said they think it's somewhat or very likely that they could run out of retirement savings. Despite having lofty goals for their retirement nest eggs, many workers are falling short. According to the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, the most recent data available, Americans had median retirement savings of $87,000. Americans also express generational differences when it comes to retirement — and the nation's youngest adults have the biggest aspirations, the study found. About 63% of Gen Z — whose oldest members are now in their early to mid-20s — say they believe they will be financially prepared for retirement. That's far higher than the millennial or baby boomer generation, with their confidence at 54% and 56%, respectively. Part of this, Wilke said, is due to an interest in wealth building among Gen Z. ""FinTok, meme stocks and cryptocurrency piqued their interest,"" the wealth management advisor said. Gen Z also started their retirement planning earlier than other generations, with members of the group starting to save at the average age of 24, with the goal of leaving the workforce at 61. In contrast, older generations started saving much later, with boomers beginning at an average age of 37 and with plans to retire at 72. The least confident generation is Gen X, or workers between about 45 to 60 years old, with only 46% saying they believe they'll hit retirement in good financial shape, the survey found. Gen X could be described as ""Generation AnXiety,"" Wilke added. As the first generation of U.S. workers to lean on 401(k) plans as a primary means of saving, they're generally more underprepared for retirement than other generations, with about half telling Natixis last year that they'd need a miracle to retire. Retirement savings can vary, depending on age — NerdWallet offers a handy breakdown — but overall, about one in four Americans with retirement savings say they've put aside one year or less of their current annual income, the Northwestern Mutual survey found. Building a $1.26 million retirement fund is easier if you start young. Workers who begin to save at age 20 would need to sock away $330 per month to reach $1.26 million, while people starting at age 30 would need to save $695 per month, according to Northwestern Mutual. Still, saving will look different for everyone, experts say. John from AARP outlined a few considerations for people to keep in mind as they map out their retirement plan, including: Mary Cunningham is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch.

3 questions to ask about your retirement savings when stocks plunge The first weeks of the new Trump administration have sparked stock market jitters and recession fears. Here's advice from top experts. MAR 17,Worried how the stock market could impact your retirement? Here are 3 questions from experts.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-investing-401k-recession-how-to-prepare-for-retirement/,"Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire — a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year. But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets or rising recession risks because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say. Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called ""correction"" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday. The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say. ""First of all, you aren't alone — a lot of people are panicking,"" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action."" The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report. ""Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,"" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. ""One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics."" Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account. It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say. Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time. ""How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically — all of that is completely valid to consider,"" TIAA's Ornstein said. But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment. ""Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have"" to manage that risk, he noted. Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement. But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said. ""Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 — they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover"" before they retire, he noted. ""But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years."" He added, ""We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change."" In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan. More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research has found. Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said. ""Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,"" he said. When markets head south, ""It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments."" For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries. And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund. Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law. ""The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,"" she said. ""Now is the time to find out how to build that up.""

"What has DEI actually done for U.S. workers and employers? President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved? JAN 28","What has DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — done for U.S. workers and employers?",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-corporate-programs/,"President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies. DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity. This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as ""illegal and immoral,"" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave. DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation. Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism. But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees. ""DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'"" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool."" In defining DEI, Glasgow described ""diversity"" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. ""It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,"" he said. Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status. ""These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,"" she explained. The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work. ""It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,"" Fulton said. ""It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive."" Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton. ""It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,"" Fulton said. Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford, Harley Davidson, McDonald's, Meta and more. Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues. Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. ""It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,"" he said. ""It also depends on what you are trying to achieve."" One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired — patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness. By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool. Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line. ""The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,"" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. ""The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry."" In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management — women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015. ""[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,"" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.

"The best and worst U.S. states for finding a good job in 2024 Ample job opportunities, low unemployment and reasonable commute times make this the top U.S. state for job seekers, analysis finds. OCT 30, 2024",The best and worst U.S. states for finding a good job in 2024,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-worst-states-for-jobs-2024/,"While it's no easy feat to pick up and move to a part of the country with a superior job market, knowing where to look can help narrow a search. The best U.S. states for job seekers feature rich career opportunities, low unemployment, and strong job and overall economic growth, according to a new study from WalletHub. ""The best states for jobs make it easier for residents to find and retain jobs, and employers in these states also offer very competitive compensation and benefits,"" WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo said in a statement. ""In addition, the top states are great places for people looking to raise a family, ranking among the best states for working parents."" To compile its ranking, the personal finance site compared the job markets and economic environment in all 50 states. It then assessed those two factors based on 34 metrics, such as compensation, employment outlook, commute times, job protections and how insulated positions are from being taken over by artificial intelligence. New Hampshire has the best job market in the nation, according on WalletHub, which also ranked the state's broader economic environment in the top 10. The state stands out for its 2% unemployment rate, compared with 4.1% for the U.S. a whole, as well as abundant job opportunities, solid employment growth and high level of job security, WalletHub found. ""To top things off, New Hampshire has the lowest percentage of the workforce living in poverty, which demonstrates that workers are generally receiving reasonable pay,"" the report states. Vermont, at No. 2, has an equally low unemployment rate, plus the highest average annual jobs growth rate in the U.S. and the second-highest number of job opportunities per capita, the analysis shows. Only 0.5% of the state's labor force has been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer, the third-lowest percentage in the U.S., according to WalletHub. Minnesota, with a thriving health care industry, ranked third. Its workers also have good access to health care and retirement benefits. Jobs are harder to come by in states such as West Virginia, Louisiana, Indiana, Kentucky, and Alaska, according to WalletHub. ""These are very low-income, rural states, and a lot of work there is usually seasonal,"" Lupo said. ""So a lot of work there is usually seasonal, and there is a lack of full-time job opportunities."" Following are top 10 best and worst states for finding a job as ranked by WalletHub.

"Want to work at Chipotle? Be prepared to chat with AI. Chipotle plans to deploy a conversational AI hiring system, dubbed ""Ava Cado,"" across more than 3,500 restaurants. OCT 22, 2024",Chipotle turns to AI hiring platform to screen job applicants,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chipotle-ava-cado-ai-hiring/,"Chipotle Mexican Grill job applicants better get used to conversing with AI — their first interview could be with an artificial intellgence-powered system named ""Ava Cado"" rather than a human hiring manager. The fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain said Tuesday that it is partnering with Paradox, a maker of what the technology company calls ""conversational"" AI, to launch the new hiring platform. By collecting basic information about candidates, Ava will free up restaurant managers to focus on other tasks, according to the company. The AI can also schedule interviews and even make job offers in real time, the company said. Ava is also a polyglot and able to conduct interviews in English, Spanish, French and German. The new technology is expected to reduce the amount of time it takes Chipotle to hire an employee for an in-restaurant position by as much 75%, Chipotle said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. Chipotle plans to deploy the system across more than 3,500 restaurant locations in North America and Europe. The technology is currently being introduced at restaurants in a phased approach that's expected to be complete by the end of October. In addition to collecting biographical information, Ava can engage with job applicants and answer their questions about the company, according to Chipotle. ""Paradox operates as if we've hired additional administrative support for all our restaurants, freeing up more time for managers to support team members and provide an exceptional guest experience. We're excited about the early improvements we're seeing,"" Chipotle chief human resources officer Ilene Eskenazi said in a statement. A number of other major restaurant chains, retailers and other companies have turned to Paradox's AI hiring tech, including Applebee's, McDonald's, Panera Bread, Taco Bell and Wendy's. Although AI can expedite the hiring process, it can also be controversial as a recruiting tool. Some studies have found that it can lead to biased assessment of candidates and unintentionally discriminate against people based on their race or gender. To guard against the misuse of AI in hiring, New York City in 2021 passed a law that requires companies that use the technology to disclose its use to job candidates. Employers are also required to conduct annual third-party ""bias audits"" of their automated hiring systems to ensure the technology isn't discriminating against certain types of candidates.

Cartel leader among 16 arrested in historic U.S. fentanyl bust,"Sinaloa cartel leader among 16 arrested in historic U.S. fentanyl bust, Justice Department says",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fentany-bust-arrests-justice-department-pam-bondi/,"Sixteen people have been arrested and three million pills laced with fentanyl were seized in what federal prosecutors said Tuesday was the ""largest fentanyl bust in DEA history."" The operation, which spanned several states along in the West, ""marks the most significant victory in our nation's fight against fentanyl and drug trafficking to date,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said. Among those arrested was a Sinaloa cartel leader, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, 36, a Mexican national, who was taken into custody in Salem, Oregon, Bondi said at a press conference. In February, the State Department designated the Sinaloa cartel as a foreign terrorist organization. Asked whether any of those arrested would be deported to Mexico, Bondi said ""I want them to stay in our prisons as long as possible."" ""Most of these individuals, if convicted, will remain in American prisons, perhaps Alcatraz,"" the attorney general added in reference to the shuttered California prison that President Donald Trump said he wants to reopen. The Justice Department said law enforcement officials seized more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of fentanyl pills, 11.5 kilos of fentanyl powder, 80 kilos of methamphetamine, 7.5 kilos of cocaine and 4.5 kilos of heroin. The bust also netted $5 million in cash and 49 rifles and pistols, U.S. officials said, while releasing several images of the seized items. ""This case represents DEA's largest single seizure of fentanyl pills,"" said Robert Murphy, the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Bondi said 75,000 Americans are dying each year because of fentanyl and it is the number one cause of death for people between the ages of 18 and 34 in the United States. ""They are flooding our cities with a weapon of mass destruction, fentanyl,"" she said. Ryan Ellison, U.S. attorney for the district of New Mexico, said the ""sophisticated fentanyl and narcotics distribution network"" spanned New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. Ellison said the 16 people arrested face various federal charges including conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and firearms offenses. The DEA says drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 44, though most states have seen fewer deaths over the last few years. Between 2022 and 2023, overdose deaths decreased by 4% nationwide, marking the first such decline since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Overdose deaths fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024."
"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say","Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-may-soon-deport-migrants-to-libya/,"The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans. Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

5 charged after migrant boat capsized off San Diego coast,5 charged after migrant boat capsizes off San Diego; Noem asks DOJ for death penalty,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-migrant-boat-human-smuggling/,"Five Mexican nationals are facing charges after a small boat carrying more than a dozen people capsized off the coast of San Diego, killing three passengers, including a 14-year-old boy from India, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of California announced Tuesday. The boy's parents and two others were hospitalized following the human smuggling event, prosecutors confirmed in a news release. Nine other migrants were missing from the boat and were presumed dead, but authorities later located eight of them in Chula Vista, nearly 30 miles away from Del Mar, where the boat was found. A 10-year-old Indian girl, the boy's sister, remains missing, prosecutors said. ""The drowning deaths of these children are a heartbreaking reminder of how little human traffickers care about the costs of their deadly business,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said in a statement. U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday that there were originally 16 individuals on board, some of whom remain missing. Jesus Ivan Rodriguez-Leyva and Julio Cesar Zuniga-Luna were arrested on Monday at the beach where the overturned boat washed ashore, according to prosecutors. They were charged with Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Bringing in Aliens for Financial Gain, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday night announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty. ""Their deaths were not only avoidable but were also the direct result of the greed and indifference of smugglers who exploited them,"" Noem said in a statement, in part. ""Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, alien smuggling acts that result in death are capital crimes punishable by death. And under the Federal Death Penalty Act, those who intentionally participate in conduct knowing that it could result in the loss of life may be eligible for capital punishment."" Prosecutors said three other suspects — Melissa Jennelle Cota, Gustavo Lara and Sergio Rojas-Fregoso — were arrested late Monday night after Border Patrol agents in Chula Vista identified a vehicle seen at a beach in Del Mar and investigated. While the driver of said vehicle fled, officers located two other vehicles involved and found the missing migrants, according to prosecutors. Cota, Lara and Rojas-Fregoso were charged with Transportation of Illegal Aliens. Prosecutors said Rojas-Fregoso had been previously deported on Dec. 19, 2023. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. It was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles north of the Mexico border, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told The Associated Press. He said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. In 2023, eight people were killed when two boats capsized off the San Diego coast. Kiki Intarasuwan is a news editor for CBS News & Stations."
Young boy gains perspective well beyond his years after tornado,"A young boy lost his home in a tornado. One year later, he's gained perspective well beyond his years.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-boy-lost-home-oklahoma-tornado-gained-perspective/,"Bartlesville, Oklahoma — A year after a tornado flattened his family's home, 9-year-old River Garrett isn't focused on what was lost — but on what can still be built. ""Rebuilding, it takes a while, it takes hard work. But to me, it's putting something back together where it is better than before,"" River said, outside his grandmother's brand new home in northern Oklahoma. On May 6, 2024, a powerful tornado tore across the area, killing two people and causing $25 million in damage. River's family survived, but their ranch was leveled. Tornado activity like what River lived through has significantly increased. In the first four months of 2025, there were 670 tornado reports and 35 deaths in the U.S. — more than a 43% jump in storms compared to the decade before, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. River's family is still sorting through the bits and pieces they were able to recover, but they consider themselves lucky. In Barnsdall, the next town over, Mayor Johnny Kelley said only 5% of his community has been rebuilt since the last time CBS News visited. But River, though just 8 at the time, seemed to understand the reality that others had it worse off than him. ""And I said to myself that I can't make this about me,"" River told CBS News back then. One year later, River has a new room and some old things that survived the tornado. He hopes to cover the walls with Michael Jackson pictures and records. ""I love my room, too. I was blown away when I saw my room, and I love it,"" River said. When asked how he's changed since the tornado, River said, ""I think I'm more aware of little things that can turn into big things. But I don't always worry about that."" ""I don't sweat unless it gets bigger over time, like the tornado did,"" he added. It's a reminder that even after unimaginable loss, a little perspective can help you heal.

Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-less-than-2-dozen-hostages-believed-to-be-alive-in-gaza/,"President Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. ""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. ""There's 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,"" Mr. Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition."
Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit,"Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit to ""Make America Film Again""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-gavin-newsom-film-tariffs-tax-credit/,"President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit. ""California built the film industry — and we're ready to bring even more jobs home. We've proven what strong state incentives can do,"" Newsom's post on X said. ""Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again."" His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was ""DYING a very fast death."" The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels. Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit from $330 million to $750 million. Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027. Mr. Trump said the American film industry has been ""decimated"" by other countries and the ""grossly incompetent"" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to ""abandon"" the U.S. But he vowed that ""we'll get it back."" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to ""make sure they're happy with"" the prospective tariffs. The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?"" Mr. Trump said. ""That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built."" Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage. ""And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,"" he said. He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California. ""I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,"" The president visited Los Angeles in late-January, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. ""I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. ""I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation."" Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor. ""I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,"" he said.

Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-u-s-bicycle-company-kent-international-halts-imports-from-china/,"The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations. ""When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,"" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. ""And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees."" Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream. About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs. During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone. Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold. He says that makes him feel ""really bad"" and ""angry."" ""China is not paying these tariffs,"" Arnold said. ""We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted."" The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May. Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile. ""We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,"" Kramer said. ""And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair."" Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective. ""I can't even calculate that high,"" Kramer said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. ""I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example…I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.""

Top Trump officials will meet with China amid trade war,Top Trump officials will meet with China amid trade war,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-china-trade-war-meeting/,"Two Trump administration officials will meet with their Chinese counterparts to discuss trade in the coming days, the administration said Tuesday — a potentially key moment several weeks after the United States and China imposed steep tariffs on each other. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will ""meet with his counterpart from the People's Republic of China to discuss trade matters"" during a trip to Switzerland, his office said in a statement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will also travel to Switzerland this week, where he will meet with China's ""lead representative on economic matters."" The statement didn't identify who he would speak with, but Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in a post on X that Bessent will meet with Vice Premier He Lifeng. In a social media post Tuesday night, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. confirmed the Switzerland meeting, writing that China ""has decided to agree to engage with the #US side."" In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Bessent said he will meet with a Chinese team on Saturday and Sunday, and initial discussions will likely be about ""de-escalation, not about the big trade deal."" The Treasury secretary said the U.S. and China have ""shared interests"" because the sky-high tariffs imposed by both countries last month are not ""sustainable."" ""The world has been coming to the U.S., and China has been the missing piece,"" Bessent said on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle."" Hours before the U.S.-China meetings were announced, Bessent told lawmakers in a hearing that the U.S. had ""not engaged in negotiations"" with China yet. China and the United States have been locked in a tense tariff standoff in recent weeks, threatening to upend relations between the world's two largest economies and imperil more than a half-trillion dollars in annual trade between the two countries. President Trump hit China with 145% tariffs on many goods last month, part of a wider swath of steep ""reciprocal tariffs"" on dozens of U.S. trading partners that Mr. Trump has accused of unfair practices. China later retaliated with 125% tariffs on imports from the United States. And while Mr. Trump paused many of his reciprocal tariffs in the hope of striking new trade deals with other countries, he left the China tariffs in place. The escalating trade war has led to weeks of stock market turbulence, and sparked fears of slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Mr. Trump — who has cast his tariff strategy as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and cut trade deficits — has suggested at various points that he's open to striking deals with U.S. trading partners, though he said earlier Tuesday, ""We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us."" In an interview with NBC News last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials ""want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal."" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China ""at some point."" Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but pushed the Trump administration to drop its ""unilateral"" tariffs first. When asked about China's request to end tariffs before negotiations start, Bessent told Fox News he's ""not going to give away our strategy"" but ""everything's on the table.""

With the Mariners trailing by one, Jorge Polanco drew a one-out walk from reliever Tyler Ferguson (0-1) in the ninth. Rodríguez followed with a single and Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Raleigh's single to right field gave Seattle a 4-3 lead, and Dylan Moore added a sacrifice fly. Carlos Vargas got three outs for his first major league save, retiring pinch-hitter Seth Brown with two on to end it. Collin Snider (1-0) gave up a go-ahead single to Miguel Andujar in the eighth but prevented further damage. Seattle is 17–6 since April 9, the best record in the big leagues during that span. J.P.

Valkyries fall short in second half comeback losing 83-82 against Sparks The Valkyries showed they have some grit in their first-ever game after mounting a comeback in the second half of their preseason match-up against the Sparks. 7H AGO,Valkyries fall short after unsuccessful second half comeback losing 83-82 to Sparks in first-ever game,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/valkyries-sparks-preseason-game-2025-first-ever-game/,"In their first-ever game, the Golden State Valkyries lost to the Los Angeles Sparks 83-82 after mounting a strong but unsuccessful comeback with the help of Laeticia Amihere, who scored 20 points. Tiffany Hayes, Veronica Burton, Kayla Thornton, Monique Billings and Temi Fagbenle took to the court as the Valkyries' first-ever starting lineup during their preseason game. It was Natalie Nakase's first game as a WNBA head coach, and she made history becoming the WNBA's first Asian American head coach. The Sparks took an early lead in the matchup off a layup by All-WNBA player Kelsey Plum. The Valkyries quickly got on the board after Hayes connected with Billings for 2 points. Golden State cut the lead to 6-5, but the Sparks pulled ahead, going on a 6-0 run. The Valkyries finished the first quarter trailing 16-13. The Sparks pulled ahead going into halftime with a commanding 39-25 lead. The first half was a battle in the paint. Both teams scored more than half their points from in the paint. Golden State scored 14 while Los Angeles scored 26. Billings had a strong first half with 7 rebounds and 7 points. Thornton, who came off a championship-winning season with the New York Liberty, had 4 rebounds and 6 points. They took the majority of the shots, alongside Hayes. Kate Martin, who was the 2024 Sixth Woman of the Year, Carla Leite, Julie Vanloo and Laeticia Amihere, combined for 7 first-half points off the bench. The Valkyries got off to a hot start in the third quarter with a 3-pointer by Thornton, kicking off an 11-2 run to bring Golden State within 2. The Sparks began to pull away again, taking a 54 to 45 lead with just over two minutes left in the third quarter. Then, the Valkyries went on their best run of the game, tying the game at 54-54 with 38 seconds left. The Sparks responded with a 3-pointer, which the Valkyries quickly matched as Kyara Linskens connected with Amihere for a 3-pointer with less than five seconds left to enter the final quarter 57-57. The Valkyries outscored the Spark 32-18 in the third quarter. The Sparks scored the first basket in the fourth quarter and never let the lead go. Amihere scored the Valkyries' first points in the final quarter and helped keep them within single digits of the Sparks. A steal by Vanloo got the Valkyries within one point after she threw a dime to Kaitlyn Chen on the fast break, bringing the score to 66-67, with 5 minutes left in the game. The Valkyries had a strong second half but fell short, losing by 1 point after a buzzer-beater by Amihere brought the final score to 83-82. The Sparks had two inactive players, forward Cameron Brink and guard Julie Allemand. Stephanie Talbot and Cecilia Zandalasini were inactive for the Valkyries.

"Warriors take Game 1 from Wolves 99-88 Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Golden State star Stephen Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and the Warriors opened the second-round series with an inspired 99-88 victory over the Timberwolves. 8H AGO",Wolves struggle to keep up with the Warriors in Game 1 despite Curry's departure,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/warriors-take-game-1-from-wolves/,"Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Golden State star Stephen Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and the Warriors opened the second-round series with an inspired 99-88 victory over the stumbling Timberwolves on Tuesday night. Hield picked up where he left off in the Game 7 win at Houston that finished the first round by scoring 24 points on 5-for-8 3-point shooting. Jimmy Butler had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and Green had four first-half 3s on his way to 18 points, as the Warriors used 12 players, plenty of hustle and lockdown defense to overcome the concerning departure of their sharpshooting leader. The home teams have yet to win in the second round of these NBA playoffs. Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday. The big question: Will Curry will be available? The league's career leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that. Warriors coach Steve Kerr shrewdly sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off. The Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter. Anthony Edwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after a particularly rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"

"Sharks to pick 2nd in 2025 NHL Draft following last-place finish The New York Islanders won the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vaulted nine teams, including the last-place San Jose Sharks, in winning the opportunity to have the No. 1 pick. MAY 6",Sharks to pick 2nd in 2025 NHL Draft following last-place finish,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/2025-nhl-draft-lottery-san-jose-sharks-2nd-pick/,"New York Islanders pro scouting director Ken Morrow knows a thing or two about so-called hockey miracles. Witnessing the Islanders win the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vault nine other teams in the order for the right to have the No. 1 pick represented yet another memorable moment for the four-time Stanley Cup champion and member of the 1980 gold-medal-winning ""Miracle on Ice"" U.S. Olympic team. ""I've had a lot of thrills in my hockey life, but this is right up there at the top,"" Morrow said. ""The hockey gods smiled on us. I can't tell you how thrilled I am for Islanders fans, for our ownership, for the entire Islanders organization."" The Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, are in the midst of a front-office shakeup after not renewing general manager Lou Lamoriello's contract on April 22. And they earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot — the 10th-best odds — of seeing their numbers come up. New York wasn't the only team to buck the lottery odds. The Utah Hockey Club won the second round of the lottery, and made the jump from 14th to fourth under the rules limiting teams from moving up no more than 10 spots in the draft order. ""A couple of seconds ago, we were just like 10 back, so it still hasn't sunk in,"" Utah GM Bill Armstrong said of a first-year franchise that finished just seven points out of a playoff spot. ""This is an exciting moment for us. It's a game-changer for us."" The San Jose Sharks will pick second after entering the day with the best odds, 18.5%, to win the lottery and a 25.5% chance of landing the No. 1 choice. San Jose, which finished last for a second consecutive year, was seeking to become the NHL's first team to win the lottery and pick first in consecutive years. ""We definitely lucked it out last year to be able to select Mac,"" Sharks GM Mike Grier said in referring to selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall. ""This year would have obviously been nice to have the pick and have the choice of all the players. But picking two, we're still in a pretty good spot so we're happy."" The Chicago Blackhawks had the second-best chances to win the lottery and will pick third. The remaining 12 teams moved two spots back in the order, starting with Nashville dropping from third to fifth. The final 16 draft spots will be determined following the playoffs. The Islanders have the right to pick first for the fifth time in team history, and first since selecting John Tavares with the No. 1 choice in 2009. This year's draft will be held in Los Angeles with the first round taking place on June 27, followed by the final six rounds the next day. Top prospects will convene for the weeklong predraft combine being held in Buffalo next month. The prospect pool is not considered as deep at the top as last year's class, or next year's group, with Canadian junior forward Gavin McKenna long regarded as the No. 1 candidate. Erie Otters defenseman Matthew Schaefer is NHL Central Scouting's top-ranked North American prospect followed by OHL Saginaw center Michael Misa and Boston College center James Hagens, the top-ranked U.S. born prospect. Hagens is from Long Island and grew up an Islanders fan. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 183 pounds, Schaefer maintained his No. 1 position despite missing the final three months of the season after breaking his right collarbone representing Canada at the world junior championships in December. Schaefer has the potential of becoming only the fifth defenseman selected No. 1 since 2000, and first since Buffalo chose Owen Power in 2021. And he also has the chance of being the first OHL player to go No. 1 since Edmonton drafted Erie's Connor McDavid in 2015. The top-ranked international skaters are center Anton Frondell and right wing Victor Eklund, who are teammates with Djurgarden of Sweden's second division league. New York's jump from 10th to first is the biggest involving a team winning the No. 1 selection. And it comes after the last-place team won the lottery to retain the first pick in four of the past five years and 12 times overall since the NHL launched the format in 1995. The New York Rangers enjoyed the previous largest move up to No. 1 in 2020, when they were grouped among eight teams — ranked eighth to 15th — with the same odds to win the lottery after being eliminated in the COVID-altered play-in round of the expanded 24-team playoff format. The lottery was held at the NHL Network studios in New Jersey, and conducted live for the first time in the event's 30-year history. Previously, the lottery was held shortly before the broadcast in front of a limited audience of sequestered observers, followed by the draft selections being revealed in reverse order."

Wilson finished with three hits and three RBIs, including a tying single against Mariners closer Andrés Muñoz leading off the 10th that scored automatic runner JJ Bleday. The Athletics then loaded the bases with nobody out, but Muñoz struck out the next three batters and still has not allowed an earned run this season. One inning later, a sacrifice bunt by Gio Urshela and two intentional walks loaded the bases for Wilson. He smacked a one-out single off Casey Legumina (2-1) through the middle of a drawn-in infield as the Athletics pulled within a game of the first-place Mariners. It was Wilson's third walk-off hit in 62 major league games and second this season. Hogan Harris (1-0) got the win with a scoreless 11th. Miguel Andujar's sacrifice fly in the first and Wilson's RBI single in the second staked the Athletics to a 2-0 lead. Jorge Polanco, Rowdy Tellez, Miles Mastrobuoni and Ben Williamson each drove in a run in the third off Athletics starter Luis Severino to put Seattle ahead 4-2. Shea Langeliers led off the fourth with his eighth homer and Lawrence Butler tied it with a two-out RBI single. Langeliers' sacrifice fly off Collin Snider in the seventh gave the Athletics a 5-4 advantage.

On Tuesday, tables filled Que Rico nightclub for a taco fundraiser, an attempt to turn the break-in, into a bounce back. Rick Hernandez Graham lives in Castro Valley and doesn't come into Oakland as much anymore, but he did for this event. ""It all just kinda fell into place,"" said Hernandez Graham. But a last-minute personal matter brought him into town and he remembered a social media post about ""Tacos for a Cause."" ""We were on our way up here, and I thought today is the taco benefit today too, so I thought we'd do both at once,"" said Hernandez Graham. Que Rico is trying to cover the $5,000 in damage and thousands more in alcohol lost during a break-in on April 29. Video from the most recent break-in shows the suspects moving around the back room and then disabling a camera. Hernandez Graham worries this bar continues to be targets because it is the only LGBTQ Latin Club in Northern California. ""There are people that have walked around their whole lives with a target on their back. All we can do is protect them, all we can do is support them, and when they fall, pick them up,"" explained Hernandez Graham. Que Rico Owner Valentino Carrillo said it is the 11th time his business has been broken into, and it only opened in 2021. ""Over four years that we've been broken into during that time, I estimate we lost over $100,000,"" said Carrillo. He said it's starting to impact every part of the business. ""It definitely affects staff morale, salaries, upgrades we want to do to the bar, community events that we do,"" Carrillo detailed. A long-term lease at their downtown location near Franklin and 15th street means the business can't just move. ""It's very frustrating, there's very little we can do,"" explained Carrillo. ""We've fortified the place, we make a lot of changes but every time they figure out a way to keep coming."" But customers like Hernandez Graham keep coming too.

Orinda neighborhood paid for its own license plate reader cameras to deter crime,Orinda neighborhood paid for its own license plate reader cameras to deter crime,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/orinda-neighborhood-paid-for-its-own-license-plate-reader-cameras-to-deter-crime/,"Residents in one East Bay community got so fed up with the number of burglaries and break-ins that they took matters into their own hands, paying to install their own license plate reader cameras. Now, those same residents are asking the city of Orinda to pick up the tab on their cameras and add 15 more. Evan Dreyer said there are at least a dozen neighbors who have surveillance video of burglars casing houses or breaking into homes in the Knickerbocker neighborhood of Orinda. ""This is something that in this neighborhood we dealt with personally, not only myself but other people,"" he said. Dreyer said his home in Orinda was broken into in January 2024, and after that, he and his family no longer felt safe. ""We understand that getting city governments and city budgets to do things sometimes can take time. This wasn't something we could wait around on so we wanted to lead by example,"" he said. Dreyer sent out emails to a bunch of his neighbors and asked if they'd be interested in paying for their own license plate reader cameras. In just a few days, he got 30 families to sign on. They installed 2 Flock cameras at the main entrances to the neighborhood at a cost of a little over $11,000 for a two-year contract, which came out to about $400 per family. ""Like this car right here that's coming down right now, for example. It's going to automatically turn on, take a picture of this license plate, and if that car was a vehicle that was wanted, by the police, it would automatically give them an alert so they will now know, oh, he just crossed by Stein Way and they can do something,"" explained Dreyer. At the meeting on Tuesday night, the Orinda City Council is considering not only picking up the contract on the two cameras Evan and his neighbors paid for but also adding another 15 more. Privacy advocates have raised concerns in general about these license plate reader cameras because almost every law enforcement agency in the area can get access to the data. ""What is the information being used for? And why is it OK for people's license plates to be captured indiscriminately by law enforcement when people driving down the road are really not breaking any laws,"" said Karen Gullo with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In Orinda, that hasn't seemed to slow down deployment. The city currently has a total of 19 cameras, and of those, only 7 were installed by the city. The other 12 were installed by neighborhood groups or HOAs. ""I want to keep my neighbors and my neighborhood safe. Absolutely,"" said Scott Johnson. He said his HOA already paid for a camera at the entrance to their community. Johnson said while he thinks the city should pick up the tab, he's willing to foot the bill if necessary. ""Fix the roads and fix the lights. Yes, we'd all like to see society work better, but a lot of our municipalities really don't seem to be following through,"" he said.

Valkyries fall short in second half comeback losing 83-82 against Sparks,Valkyries fall short after unsuccessful second half comeback losing 83-82 to Sparks in first-ever game,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/valkyries-sparks-preseason-game-2025-first-ever-game/,"In their first-ever game, the Golden State Valkyries lost to the Los Angeles Sparks 83-82 after mounting a strong but unsuccessful comeback with the help of Laeticia Amihere, who scored 20 points. Tiffany Hayes, Veronica Burton, Kayla Thornton, Monique Billings and Temi Fagbenle took to the court as the Valkyries' first-ever starting lineup during their preseason game. It was Natalie Nakase's first game as a WNBA head coach, and she made history becoming the WNBA's first Asian American head coach. The Sparks took an early lead in the matchup off a layup by All-WNBA player Kelsey Plum. The Valkyries quickly got on the board after Hayes connected with Billings for 2 points. Golden State cut the lead to 6-5, but the Sparks pulled ahead, going on a 6-0 run. The Valkyries finished the first quarter trailing 16-13. The Sparks pulled ahead going into halftime with a commanding 39-25 lead. The first half was a battle in the paint. Both teams scored more than half their points from in the paint. Golden State scored 14 while Los Angeles scored 26. Billings had a strong first half with 7 rebounds and 7 points. Thornton, who came off a championship-winning season with the New York Liberty, had 4 rebounds and 6 points. They took the majority of the shots, alongside Hayes. Kate Martin, who was the 2024 Sixth Woman of the Year, Carla Leite, Julie Vanloo and Laeticia Amihere, combined for 7 first-half points off the bench. The Valkyries got off to a hot start in the third quarter with a 3-pointer by Thornton, kicking off an 11-2 run to bring Golden State within 2. The Sparks began to pull away again, taking a 54 to 45 lead with just over two minutes left in the third quarter. Then, the Valkyries went on their best run of the game, tying the game at 54-54 with 38 seconds left. The Sparks responded with a 3-pointer, which the Valkyries quickly matched as Kyara Linskens connected with Amihere for a 3-pointer with less than five seconds left to enter the final quarter 57-57. The Valkyries outscored the Spark 32-18 in the third quarter. The Sparks scored the first basket in the fourth quarter and never let the lead go. Amihere scored the Valkyries' first points in the final quarter and helped keep them within single digits of the Sparks. A steal by Vanloo got the Valkyries within one point after she threw a dime to Kaitlyn Chen on the fast break, bringing the score to 66-67, with 5 minutes left in the game. The Valkyries had a strong second half but fell short, losing by 1 point after a buzzer-beater by Amihere brought the final score to 83-82. The Sparks had two inactive players, forward Cameron Brink and guard Julie Allemand. Stephanie Talbot and Cecilia Zandalasini were inactive for the Valkyries.

Warriors take Game 1 from Wolves 99-88,Wolves struggle to keep up with the Warriors in Game 1 despite Curry's departure,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/warriors-take-game-1-from-wolves/,"Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Golden State star Stephen Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and the Warriors opened the second-round series with an inspired 99-88 victory over the stumbling Timberwolves on Tuesday night. Hield picked up where he left off in the Game 7 win at Houston that finished the first round by scoring 24 points on 5-for-8 3-point shooting. Jimmy Butler had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and Green had four first-half 3s on his way to 18 points, as the Warriors used 12 players, plenty of hustle and lockdown defense to overcome the concerning departure of their sharpshooting leader. The home teams have yet to win in the second round of these NBA playoffs. Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday. The big question: Will Curry will be available? The league's career leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that. Warriors coach Steve Kerr shrewdly sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off. The Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter. Anthony Edwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after a particularly rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA"

When most students have called it a day, Nanik Tagore is just getting started. A shooting guard for the Dominican University men's basketball team, he's got range, control and a shot that rarely misses. But when it came time to find housing in the Bay Area, he was out of his league. ""San Rafael is one of the most expensive places to live,"" Tagore said. ""So, I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to live on my own."" That's when he came across a new startup called Joey — a platform that matches students with homeowners who need a little help around the house. Tagore now pays $1,700 for a room in Marin County. But he works off about $500 of that doing chores that don't show up on a resume but say a lot about a person: walking the dog, sorting the mail, taking out the trash, even making lunch. Because of employment regulations, renters in the Joey program pay full rent upfront, then get reimbursed for the hours they work — a workaround designed to stay compliant with labor laws. He now lives with Paige and Jason Miller, a couple who could use the help. Jason is a full-time caregiver. Paige Miller is living with early-stage dementia. She can't drive, and Jason works long hours running a company. ""My worry actually was Paige,"" Jason Miller said. ""Would she feel comfortable having somebody else live in the house?"" Turns out, she was more than comfortable. ""It gives me back my freedom,"" Paige Miller said. ""And he's great to have around. He laughs at my jokes."" With roughly 60% of U.S. homes containing at least one spare bedroom, Joey's founder Alison Donnally sees untapped potential. ""It just didn't make sense to me why we couldn't have something similar to an au pair, but for older adults,"" she said. Tagore is the first person to be placed through the app, but Donnally said applications are already being processed. ""What we can do at JoeyCo is create more bedroom inventory for these students,"" she said. As for Tagore, he said he's found more than just a place to stay. ""It doesn't feel like work,"" he said. ""It doesn't feel like a chore to lend a helping hand."""

Volatility in the stock market leads to soaring gold prices,Volatility in the stock market leads to soaring gold prices,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/volatility-in-the-stock-market-leads-to-soaring-gold-prices/,"The price of gold continues hover in record high territory, as investors look to the precious metal with the growing uncertainty in the stock market. That is good news for Seth Chandler, owner of Witter Coin in San Francisco who seeing more people come into his store to buy and sell gold. ""When you have a one-ounce gold coin in your hand, it feels very heavy, it feels like real money,"" said Chandler. And since the beginning of the year, the price of gold is up more than 28-percent (May 6th 2025), hitting $3,000 per ounce on March 14th, and briefing reaching a record high above $3,500 per ounce on April 22nd. Joe Halpern, Chief Investment Officer of Fountainhead says, the recent interest in gold can be tied to the volatility in the stock market, since the start of the Trump Administration. ""It has been going up for a while now for over the last year. But you really saw lift after Liberation Day on April 2nd. At first gold moved down with the whole market, but then it increased dramatically,"" said Halpern. ""And gold is really a flight to safety. So, when people are nervous, they tend to sell out of those risky assets like an Apple or a Microsoft, and they go into Treasury or gold."" Halpern says, for those looking to invest you can buy into a Gold ETF or mutual fund. Meanwhile for Chandler, while he does not give out investment advice, he understands people's fascination with physical gold. ""Once you own it, you can put it in the safe deposit box, hide it under your mattress, your shoe, whatever you want. But you have it. You own it,"" said Chandler.

The prison was open for about three decades, closing in 1963. About 1,500 prisoners lived on the island, but there were also about 60 families of staff members living there as well, including Jolene Babyak. ""You know, for kids, it was absolutely wonderful,"" said Babyak about her time on the island. ""There were about 75 children on the island."" Babyak's father worked as an administrator and later an associate warden. They lived on the island in the 50s, when she was just 7 to 9 years old, and then again when she was 15. It was separated into two sides, on the side she was on, it was child-centered and community-oriented with things like Halloween parties, dances and bowling leagues. ""It was very, very comfortable,"" Babyak emphasized. ""Low-crime neighborhood, I always like to say. The prisoners were focused on the opposite of the island and the escapes, we're in that direction, and we lived in our neighborhood and they never really came down and tried to escape from that area."" She said that when her father came home, he never shared stories about the dark side of his time working in the prison. ""Usually, the officers like to tell the funnier stories, and not the grim stabbings and such. We didn't hear about that too much,"" said Babyak. But those things did happen. It was a maximum security, minimum-privilege prison opened to deal with the most hardened inmates in the federal prison system. It closed in 1963. Now, it's a national park that more than a million people from all over the world visit it each year. Valentina Forat was visiting with her family from Mexico. ""We got to get in the cells and it was shivery,"" Valentina Forat explained. Her brother, Lucas Forat, said he wanted to learn about its history, a history he doesn't think should be repeated. ""I would not prefer to open it,"" said Lucas Forat. ""I think the prisons that are already here in the United States are very good, and we're good without it."" In her adulthood, Babyak has continued to learn about Alcatraz, interviewing prisoners and officers, and writing a book. She doesn't believe it would be feasible to reopen it. ""It would be very, very expensive,"" said Babyak. ""The building itself was ancient 62 years ago. It doesn't have the infrastructure. Water and sewage being the biggest problems."" It's not just the expense of upgrades, but also of operation. It closed because it was too expensive, all of it's supplies like, food, fuel, and fresh water, had to be delivered by boat. ""I think we have much more sophisticated prisons now,"" explained Babyak. ""You'd really have to come in and completely re-build the prison."""
Oakland LGBTQ nightclub holds fundraiser to raise money after recent burglary,Oakland LGBTQ nightclub holds fundraiser to raise money after recent burglary,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/oakland-lgbtq-nightclub-holds-fundraiser-to-raise-money-after-recent-burglary/,"OAKLAND — An Oakland LGBTQ nightclub is trying to do what it can to recover after a recent burglary. On Tuesday, tables filled Que Rico nightclub for a taco fundraiser, an attempt to turn the break-in, into a bounce back. Rick Hernandez Graham lives in Castro Valley and doesn't come into Oakland as much anymore, but he did for this event. ""It all just kinda fell into place,"" said Hernandez Graham. But a last-minute personal matter brought him into town and he remembered a social media post about ""Tacos for a Cause."" ""We were on our way up here, and I thought today is the taco benefit today too, so I thought we'd do both at once,"" said Hernandez Graham. Que Rico is trying to cover the $5,000 in damage and thousands more in alcohol lost during a break-in on April 29. Video from the most recent break-in shows the suspects moving around the back room and then disabling a camera. Hernandez Graham worries this bar continues to be targets because it is the only LGBTQ Latin Club in Northern California. ""There are people that have walked around their whole lives with a target on their back. All we can do is protect them, all we can do is support them, and when they fall, pick them up,"" explained Hernandez Graham. Que Rico Owner Valentino Carrillo said it is the 11th time his business has been broken into, and it only opened in 2021. ""Over four years that we've been broken into during that time, I estimate we lost over $100,000,"" said Carrillo. He said it's starting to impact every part of the business. ""It definitely affects staff morale, salaries, upgrades we want to do to the bar, community events that we do,"" Carrillo detailed. A long-term lease at their downtown location near Franklin and 15th street means the business can't just move. ""It's very frustrating, there's very little we can do,"" explained Carrillo. ""We've fortified the place, we make a lot of changes but every time they figure out a way to keep coming."" But customers like Hernandez Graham keep coming too. They plan to keep supporting to help offset the costs of the break-ins and hopefully find a solution. ""If we don't, they close down,"" said Hernandez Graham about why he will continue to support this business and ones like it."

Crumbling water main leaves people in a Pleasanton neighborhood high and dry,Crumbling water main leaves people in a Pleasanton neighborhood high and dry,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/pleasanton-water-shut-off/,"Last week a group of homeowners in Pleasanton had their water cut off by the city. They're locked in a battle over who should pay to replace a crumbling water main and, in the meantime, neighbors have found a creative way of helping each other out. In the middle of Pleasanton is a small neighborhood known as the Remen Tract that, years ago, refused to be annexed into the city. Rick Hempy lives there and said that's what's behind the disagreement over the neighborhood's water pipes. ""These lines that are in here were put in in 1950--two-inch steel lines--and they are disintegrating,"" he said. ""And the city of Pleasanton used to come out here and fix them. But now they're saying, 'you're on your own. Because you're in the county, even though you get city services--water, sewer, police, fire--we don't care!'"" In August, a water main started leaking and when the city came out to fix it, they discovered that the whole thing needed to be replaced. They rigged up a temporary supply line using fire hoses connected to a hydrant. But the city says they will not be replacing the permanent line. In a statement, Communications Manager Heather Tiernan said, ""The water system within Remen Tract is privately owned, and just as the City does not maintain individual property owners' water lines, it cannot maintain the private water lines within the Remen Tract."" Needless to say, the homeowners disagreed. ""This is the city of Pleasanton service territory for this municipal utility,"" said homeowner Rob Schurhoff, ""and anything on their side of the meter is their responsibility. It's in the Pleasanton municipal code. So, it's cut and dried as far as I'm concerned."" So, the fire hoses remained in place and that's how things stayed for 9 months...until about five days ago. ""So, yeah, I was really surprised when I was on the phone and, like, eight trucks came out here and removed the temporary hoses in less than five minutes and took off. I think they thought we might have an uprising or something, I don't know!"" said Schurhoff. ""And for them to come out and just unhook the water...I think it's criminal!"" said Hempy. So, how many houses are without water? ""Six,"" he said. ""They're stuck!"" Well, not really. Because the neighbors are helping each other out. Hoses have been extended from one house to another to supply the six who were left high and dry. ""Yeah, we had to rig this up because I couldn't flush my toilet or anything,"" said Schurhoff, with a laugh. And Hempy said the effort to create their own jerry-rigged water system has only brought the neighborhood closer together. ""That hose is coming from a rental way over there,' said Hempy. ""So, it's going through three yards and coming over here to take care of these three houses! Now that's nice neighbors. That's good people."" The neighbors estimate it could cost them about $6,000 each to replace the line. But they say Pleasanton charges them the same water rates as any other municipal customer and they expect the city to repair the broken line. So far, there is no resolution in sight. The neighbors believe city officials are just trying to wash their hands of the problem. Although they may have to go to another block to find the water to do that.

Along with the draft budget documents, Jenkins delivered a letter to the Council laying out in broad strokes his vision for the city's financial life, including how he'll eliminate an estimated $268 million deficit over the next two fiscal years. ""It's a pathway to physical stability,"" Jenkins said of his proposal. ""We want to ensure that public safety is a priority, that we are doing a really good job at our core statutory services."" Jenkins said he realizes that Oaklanders want to feel safer in their city and are alarmed at the prospect of cuts to police, fire and the Department of Violence Prevention. He said that the city saw a 30 percent reduction in its homicide rate over the past year and his budget will help build on that momentum by, in part, funding six police academies and providing enough money for 678 officers, with a goal of getting to 700 officers in the future. Jenkins' budget also includes two fire academies and, thanks to the recent voter-approved Measure A, funding for four fire stations that might otherwise be on the chopping block. Still, the public safety budgets—which account for 75 percent of the city's general fund spending—weren't spared from cuts. Two fire stations will be ""browned out,"" or temporarily closed, on a rotating basis and the Oakland Police Department's overtime budget has been reduced from a recent high of about $50 million per year to roughly $34 million next fiscal year and $38 million the year after that. ""As the fire department, we understand we're a spoke in the wheel. We're part of the public safety team,"" said Fire Chief Damon Covington. ""Everybody's had to take some level of cut. I know that the interim mayor and the incoming mayor have prioritized public safety, so from the fire departments perspective, we're trying to figure out different ways that we can be less impactful on the budget."" Incoming mayor Barbara Lee has been in near-daily contact with Jenkins and his budget team in order to help guide spending priorities since she won a special April 15 election to replace Sheng Thao, who voters ousted in a recall election last November. Sometime in mid- to late-May, Lee will take over for Jenkins who, as City Council president, has been filling in since Thao left office in December. Lee didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. In addition to public safety budget cuts, Jenkins' budget eliminates more than 400 mostly vacant city jobs and anticipates fewer than a dozen actual layoffs. It also anticipates adding additional revenue streams to the city budget, including a proposed $40 million-a-year parcel tax for the June 2026 ballot. It also envisions bond sales of $180 million for affordable housing investments and $15 million each year for the next two years for street paving. While the budget Jenkins delivered is balanced, his letter to the City Council warns that employee pension and medical benefit expenses are expected to rise faster than the city's project revenue growth for the foreseeable future, which means that city leaders will likely be making difficult budget decisions for years to come. In addition to police and fire budgets, Jenkins said he prioritized spending on combating illegal dumping, cleaning up homeless encampments and removing abandoned vehicles from city streets, among other things. While he didn't give specific numbers, he also said that funding levels for Oakland Parks and Recreation Department's summer and after school programs remain intact, as does spending on public libraries. Jenkins' budget proposal now is in the hands of the City Council, which has until June 30 to make whatever changes it has in mind and pass a final budget. Councilman Noel Gallo, who is serving as interim City Council president, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

For the business owner, it's another break-in that will add to mounting costs to cover damages and product replacement. The owner of Que Rico Nightclub, Valentino Carrillo, said the burglary cost them about $5,000 in damages and thousands in alcohol. In the past four years, the amount they've lost due to break-ins is about $100,000, Carrillo said. And insurance won't be helping them. ""As a small business, you can't really turn to insurance cause they'll drop you. And actually, last month, we got dropped regardless of having any claims,"" Carrillo said.

According to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office, Jeanette Ralston was last seen leaving the Lion's Den bar in San Jose bar with a man just before midnight on January 31, 1977. Her body was found the next day in a car in the parking lot of a nearby apartment complex. Ralston was 24-years-old and living in San Mateo at the time. At the time the medical examiner determined she was strangled by a long-sleeve shirt that was tied around her neck. The autopsy revealed evidence of sexual assault. The D.A.'s office said the suspect tried to light the car on fire but the Volkswagen didn't burn. Cold case detectives got a break in the case in 2024 when they found the fingerprint on a pack of Eve cigarettes. They were able to use the fingerprint to identify 69-year-old Willie Eugene Sims. The D.A.'s office said Sims was an Army Private at Ford Ord at the time. One year after the attack on Ralston he was convicted for an assault to commit murder in Monterey County. Once Sims was identified, San Jose Police investigators traveled to Ohio where they collected a DNA sample from Sims. Investigators said the DNA was consistent with DNA on Ralston's fingernails and the shirt that was found around her neck. District Attorney Jeff Rosen said: ""Every day, forensic science grows better, and every day criminals are closer to being caught. Cases may grow old and be forgotten by the public. We don't forget and we don't give up."" Sims is awaiting extradition to California. He was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Ohio. According to officials with the district attorney's office, Sims could face 25-years to life in prison if he is convicted."

Mark the ""elite"" fan, from Hastings Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of added time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie, the 37-year-old charging around with his shirt off in wild celebrations. And there were more ecstatic scenes when substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra-time before climbing up a security fence to celebrate in front of Inter's fans. It means a second Champions League final in three seasons for three-time European champions Inter after two legs of incredible drama which saw 13 goals and a tie turned on its head on several occasions. Inter, who lost 1-0 to Manchester City in the 2023 final, will play either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday, 31 May in the 2025 showpiece.

Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Alan Shearer perhaps summed it up best when he rounded off his commentary for broadcaster Amazon Prime by simply thanking both sides. ""Thank you Inter Milan, thank you Barcelona for providing us with incredible entertainment and two great football matches,"" he said. ""What we have witnessed has been something very special. It's been a pleasure to be here."" Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Mat makes sense of it in binary form there, but seriously, where do you start? Players on both sides ended the match in tears, but there were no recriminations at the full-time whistle, just a mutual respect. The emotion flooded out of centre-back Francesco Acerbi, who was pushed forward at the end of normal time and scored his first European goal at the age of 37 to make it 3-3 on the night and 6-6 on aggregate. Inter players rushed to offer their commiserations to Barcelona stars Lamine Yamal and Raphinia, who had done so much to drag their side back from two goals down to the brink of victory, before substitute Davide Frattesi settled the tie with an extra-time winner. Frattesi found the bottom corner with a cultured strike to make it 4-3 on the night, 7-6 on aggregate - the combined 13 goals over the two legs the joint highest for a Champions League semi-final.

'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end,'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c23038lpv4mo,"Inter Milan will face Paris St-Germain or Arsenal in the final on 31 May ""It gave us everything. From start to finish last week to this week, everything about this semi-final has been pure entertainment,"" said Alan Shearer. For the second time in six days Inter Milan and Barcelona served up a European classic as the champions of Italy won 4-3 on the night - 7-6 on aggregate - to reach the Champions League final. In a thriller that will be remembered for years to come, Barca had trailed 2-0 and 3-2 in the first leg in Catalonia before salvaging a 3-3 draw. On Tuesday in Milan, they were then 2-0 behind at half-time - 5-3 on aggregate - before scoring three times without reply. Raphinha's 87th-minute strike was the first time Barca had taken the lead on aggregate but Francesco Acerbi's first European goal at the age of 37 took an utterly absorbing tie into extra time, with substitute Davide Frattesi scoring the winner to send more than 70,000 Inter fans inside the San Siro into raptures. It was the joint highest-scoring Champions League semi-final ever, with the 13 goals equalling the 2018 semi-final when Liverpool also defeated Roma 7-6 on aggregate. ""We didn't expect this, did we?"" added former England captain Shearer, who was inside the San Siro for Amazon Prime. ""We expected a good game, but this? Thank you Inter Milan, thank you Barcelona for providing us with incredible entertainment and two great football matches. ""What we have witnessed has been something very special. It's been a pleasure to be here."" Inter will face either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal - who meet in the other semi-final in France on Wednesday (20:00 BST) - after one of the great modern classics. PSG lead 1-0 from the first leg. Inter beat Barcelona in all-time classic to reach Champions League final - reaction Where does Inter v Barca rank among best ever semi-finals? Inter have conceded eight goals in their past three Champions League games No neutrals wanted this tie full of twists and turns to end but, when Polish referee Szymon Marciniak sounded the final whistle at 23:38 local time, Inter Milan's players sank to their knees exhausted but triumphant. They remained on the pitch for a good 15 to 20 minutes after full-time to show their appreciation to their delirious fans, who can start booking flights and hotels for the final in Munich on 31 May. ""Inter were heading out, they were done,"" added Shearer. ""They somehow found a way to get themselves into the final. They deserve to be there."" Inter's success in this season's competition has been built on dogged resilience and clean sheets. Not against Barcelona. They conceded more goals against the La Liga leaders over 210 minutes than they had in their opening 12 matches in this season's Champions League put together. The three-time winners had kept eight clean sheets in all, with Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer recording seven of those. On Tuesday alone, Barcelona peppered Inter's goal with 22 attempts - 10 on target - and scored three times in the space of 33 minutes. But Inter dug deep to go through with substitute Davide Frattesi scoring his side's extra-time winner. ""What happened? I don't know!"" he said afterwards. ""I celebrated so loudly that my head was spinning."" Inter's Francesco Acerbi is the second oldest scorer in a Champions League semi-final (37 years & 85 days) after Ryan Giggs for Manchester United against Schalke in 2010-11 (37 years & 148 days) It is 15 years since Inter - managed by Jose Mourinho at the time - were crowned champions of Europe. No Italian side has won the Champions League since that victory over Bayern Munich in 2010. Will that change at the end of the month? While they weren't necessarily the obvious choice to win this year's competition, before a ball was kicked Opta did rate them as third favourites to go all the way behind Real Madrid and Manchester City. With both of those teams already out, Inter are now in the box seat. And they went back in time to reach their second final in three seasons. The 2023 runners-up to Manchester City are unbeaten in 16 home games in the Champions League - their longest undefeated run on their own turf in Europe since the 1980s. ""It was an amazing night,"" said Inter boss Simone Inzaghi. ""One to share with our fans, our club and our families. The players did something extraordinary. ""We played four amazing games against two world-class teams like Bayern [in the quarter-final] and Barcelona. It was great to celebrate this achievement here with our fans."" Inter's Netherlands defender Denzel Dumfries ended with two goals and three assists over the two legs against Barcelona. ""A crazy match again! Seven goals today... it was incredible,"" said Dumfries. Italy midfielder Frattesi added: ""After the game in Munich, I thought I would never experience anything like this again in terms of emotions. ""But that's the beauty of football. It's part of my career; I've always been the first to believe and the last to give up.""

"'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls","'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cx272egzwweo,"Head coach Andy Farrell (third from left) and his staff have lots of permutations to mull over The action is over, the auditions are done. Last weekend's European semi-finals were the final chance for British and Irish Lions contenders to sway head coach Andy Farrell their way. On Thursday, the talking finishes too. Back in March, Farrell said he had a list of about 75 potential tourists. When he announces his squad for Australia this summer, he and his coaches will have boiled that group down to about 37 players. The squad has been debated for months and will continue to be after Wales and Lions legend Ieuan Evans reads out the names of the chosen few from 14:00 BST on Thursday at the O2 arena. Here are some of the hottest pre-announcement topics chewed over by BBC Sport's team of pundits. LISTEN: 5 Live Lions' squad announcement preview LISTEN: Rugby Union Weekly on Lions watch LISTEN: Scrum V Lions selection committee Itoje led England Under-20s to an age-grade World Cup triumph in 2014, but otherwise had little experience of captaining until this season Might one of the two horses in the race to captain the Lions have fallen at the final hurdle? Ireland number eight Caelan Doris picked up a shoulder injury in Leinster's Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northampton this weekend, putting his touring hopes in danger. Maro Itoje may well have earned the accolade ahead of Doris regardless, but with such uncertainty over his rival for the post now, the way seems even more clear for the second row. The 30-year-old, who had not been either his club or country's regular skipper until the start of this season, would be completing a captaincy clean sweep on his third Lions tour. ""I would agree with it going to Maro,"" former England and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Matt Dawson told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""There are a couple of absolute fundamentals with Lions tour captains - first and foremost they have to be in the team and for me he is, without a shadow of a doubt. ""Secondly, he has to be held in that regard, not just by the coaches, but also by his team-mates as well. The players have to look at their captain and think 'this guy is the man'. ""Thirdly, for Maro specifically, he has blossomed beautifully this season for England. ""He has gone from being a player who was a certainty to be in the team, but was a bit short of the form of his early 20s and a little bit too ill disciplined, to being right in the groove. ""The captaincy has given him a new lease of life and he is ready to step into the role for the Lions."" Shane Horgan, who toured New Zealand alongside Dawson with the 2005 Lions, agrees. ""I think Itoje is the frontrunner,"" he said. ""You need a different type of charisma to be Lions captain because within your own nation, you can get 20 caps, build relationships with the team, become a senior player and then captain. There is none of that with the Lions. ""There are lots of players you won't have a relationship with at all - you have to be 100% respected and have a bit of an aura."" An Achilles tendon injury restricted Finn Russell's game time on the 2021 tour of South Africa Finn Russell is the man in possession of the British and Irish Lions number 10 jersey. Four years ago, he was ushered into the fray early in the deciding third Test against the Springboks and, although the tourists lost, Russell's dexterity and daring stood out. However after a modest Six Nations campaign with Scotland and the appointment of Russell-sceptic Johnny Sexton as one of the Lions coaches, doubt has been cast over whether the 30-year-old could even make the squad. Former Ireland hooker and Scarlets coach Bernard Jackman believes Russell should be straight into the team. ""For me, Russell is the starting 10,"" he told Scrum V. ""I think the stuff around Johnny joining the coaching staff - I think that will be done. ""The area Andy Farrell is most comfortable in coaching is attack. ""When you think of Ireland's attack going into the last Rugby World Cup in 2023, it was so patterned and intricate. Someone with Russell's instinct, with his passing, running and kicking game, could be unbelievably strong in that. ""I would be shocked if he wasn't on the plane. I think it is the job of the coaches to set the team up to bring the best out of him because that would bring the best out of everybody else."" Horgan agrees, adding that Russell's Lions credentials have been proven. ""Given Scotland have won just one of their past 16 meetings against his Ireland team, it will be hard for Andy Farrell to eliminate some of the doubts he may have about some of their players,"" he told 5 Live. ""But, I don't think that counts for Finn. If there was ever any doubts about Finn, they were blown out of the water by his performances on the tour in 2021. ""He was phenomenal and should have played more."" Fin Smith and Sam Prendergast, first-choice fly-halves for England and Ireland respectively, went up against each other in club colours on Saturday Twenty-nine minutes into Northampton's shock win against Leinster in the Champions Cup semi-final on Saturday, Henry Pollock took a short ball off Alex Mitchell, punched a hole and pinned back his ears. The ease with which he rounded Leinster fly-half Sam Prendergast to scorch in for a try set tongues wagging among those on the look-out for Lions. ""That must have been the worst performances Prendergast has had this season,"" said 2009 British and Irish Lions winger Ugo Monye on Rugby Union Weekly. ""You can forgive missed kicks at goal, but there was a lack of control. ""He looked like he was the fly-half playing away, he couldn't impose himself on the game. ""No-one missed more tackles in the Six Nations this year and, as well as being ruined by Henry Pollock, he looked non-committal in defence, making tap tackles. ""He will become such a focus for an attack."" ""I don't think you can take Sam, as great as his attacking ability is at the line,"" agreed former Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert on 5 Live. ""His defence is a real liability and Australia coach Joe Schmidt will be clued into that. ""His tackle completion is way, way too low to be chosen. ""By contrast, I think Northampton fly-half Fin Smith played his way onto the plane. ""That game was as close to an international as you can get, in terms of ferocity and physicality, and Fin Smith was at the heart of it, controlling things in one of the best away wins I have ever seen in Europe."" Scarlets' Murray backed to be a Lions bolter Injured Lions hopeful Hansen out for about five weeks When is the British and Irish Lions squad named? Pollock's exuberance has won over a legion of fans Pollock began this season with just one Premiership appearance to his name. His precipitous climb towards the top shows no sign of stopping though. The 20-year-old has scored more tries and beaten more defenders than any other forward in the Champions Cup this season. He has made more tackles and secured more turnovers than any other player full stop. ""Previously I thought maybe the Lions had come too soon for him,"" said former England scrum-half Danny Care on Rugby Union Weekly. ""But watching that win over Leinster, how can you not take him? ""He looked better, in every aspect, than one of the best Ireland back rows ever. ""He is an 80-minute player. To be at that level mentally and physically, in a Test match-level environment is superb. ""I like everything this kid is about. ""I'm not sure if he would start, but how good would he be for competition on that tour? ""Lob him into a midweek team and if you picked him for Test side, he wouldn't look out of place."" ""Farrell can't not pick him,"" agreed Horgan. ""Pollock was phenomenal at the weekend. It was as good a performance as I have seen in a long time. ""He doesn't know how to be bad and he will bring crazy enthusiasm - and for that reason I think he will be picked."" Williams has shone for club side Gloucester since arriving at Kingsholm from Cardiff in the summer Tomos Williams' livewire performances for both Gloucester and Wales have put him in contention for a scrum-half spot, although Scotland's Ben White - who has a ready-made understanding with Russell - could trump him in the expected race to join Ireland's Jamison Gibson-Park and England's Alex Mitchell in the squad. ""My instinct says that Ben White would better fit the way that Andy Farrell would want to play and how the Lions could play,"" said Dawson. ""And that connection with Finn Russell could be quite handy. ""However it is a valid point that the Lions organisers will want to have a healthy Wales contingent and that might count against White. That factor might edge a toss-of-a-coin decision."" ""I would be very surprised if Tomos is not on that plane, given both his form and the type of bloke he would be in that environment,"" said Cuthbert. ""Andy Farrell would like him. Tomos is very dry, and very good at being the centre of a changing room, bringing the best out of players around him."" Smith suffered an ankle injury on his last outing for Harlequins, a defeat by Leicester at the end of April Marcus Smith was called up for the last British and Lions tour while playing a summer international for England against Canada. While halfway down Allianz Stadium's tunnel, he was told by England support staff that he would be boarding a plane to South Africa, as well as a bus back to south London. The 26-year-old seemed in prime position for a fly-half slot this time around after some virtuoso displays for England in the second half of 2024. However the emergence of namesake Fin and a positional shuffle to full-back during the Six Nations has made predicting Smith's inclusion for 2025 a lot harder. Danny Care, who plays with Smith at Harlequins, backs him. ""Scotland full-back Blair Kinghorn is likely to arrive late on the tour from Toulouse so it is a massive string to Marcus Smith's bow being able to play 15,"" Care said. ""If you have two big movers on the wings, be it James Lowe, Tommy Freeman or Duhan van der Merwe, you need someone who can link and create space for them. ""Marcus Smith is the best one-on-one attacker coming from the back. He has been for two or three years. ""Added to which I don't think Andy Farrell will forget how well he played at 10 in the autumn. Some players have credit in the bank."" However Smith may find that positional specialists are preferred to his versatility. ""For all his brilliance as a player, I don't think Marcus Smith is in the top three for fly-halves who get the most out of their backline,"" said Horgan. ""Finn Russell, Fin Smith and Sam Prendergast all get backlines motoring better and I don't think you can have Marcus Smith as a starting full-back. ""He will do brilliant things, but I don't think he is a starting full-back.""

Inter Miami relinquish option to speak to De Bruyne,Inter Miami relinquish option to speak to De Bruyne,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2303n2zl0yo,"Kevin de Bruyne has scored 108 goals in 418 appearances for Manchester City Inter Miami have relinquished their option to hold talks with departing Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne - leaving Chicago Fire in pole position to sign him should he decide to move to Major League Soccer. Miami had the 33-year-old on their 'discovery list', meaning they were the only MLS team able to negotiate with him in the United States. They had until mid-July to decide whether to hold talks but sources have told BBC Sport they will not pursue his signing meaning De Bruyne will not link up with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets. Chicago now have the first option to speak to De Bruyne, who announced in April he would be leaving City when his current deal expires at the end of the season. Sources say De Bruyne's representatives are to meet with Chicago, who are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference. The Belgian later said he was surprised not to be offered a new contract by the club. De Bruyne has won 16 trophies at Etihad Stadium, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.

Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?,Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93g3g5yp2qo,"In what is already being talked about as one of the greatest Champions League semi-finals of all time, Inter Milan edged past Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate to reach the final in Munich. As one BBC Sport reader messaged to say: ""Football needed that tie."" But where does it rank among other memorable semi-final showdowns? We've picked 10 of the best - including Tuesday's humdinger at the San Siro - which you can read about below and then rank them in order of your favourite. Davide Frattesi celebrated in spectacular style after putting Inter 7-6 up on aggregate in extra time Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of stoppage time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when 37-year-old centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie. And substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra time. Barca had earlier recovered from 5-3 down on aggregate to lead 6-5 - having also trailed 2-0 and 3-2 during an equally remarkable first leg. Real Madrid beat Liverpool in the final in 2022 A thrilling first leg at Etihad Stadium saw Pep Guardiola overcome his old rivals on his most recent pursuit of Champions League glory. His side battled with Real Madrid to take a 4-3 lead into the second leg. In a game which was not short of chances, Riyad Mahrez extended City's advantage at the Bernabeu to leave Carlo Ancelotti's men needing two goals just to take the tie to extra time. Substitute Rodrygo kick-started an incredible turnaround, putting two efforts past Ederson in as many minutes right at the end of normal time. To Manchester City's disbelief they now had to put up with a fully enthused Madrid side, who managed to grab a place in the Champions League final thanks to a 95th-minute penalty from Karim Benzema. Pure drama. Liverpool went on to beat Tottenham 2-0 in the 2019 final Finalists the previous year, Jurgen Klopp's side looked as though they were heading out after a goal from Luis Suarez and a Lionel Messi double - including a dream free-kick - condemned them to a 3-0 first-leg loss at the Nou Camp. Liverpool needed a second-leg miracle. Usual starters Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were missing - but up stepped Divock Origi. The striker pulled one back in the first 10 minutes and, as belief rose inside a fervent Anfield, midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum popped up with two goals in two minutes to level the tie. Rarely have you seen Barcelona so rattled. Messi was as anonymous as he was omnipresent just a week earlier, and when Origi swept in Trent Alexander-Arnold's quick corner with 11 minutes left the incredible had become reality. Tottenham have not reached the Champions League last four since 2019 Ajax had been the breakout side of 2018-19, beating Real Madrid and Juventus to set up a tie with Tottenham. So it was perhaps no surprise when they left London with a 1-0 lead. In Amsterdam things went from bad to worse for Tottenham. With no Harry Kane up front, they were facing a mountain to climb when Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech made it 3-0 on aggregate before half-time. Lucas Moura inspired a magnificent comeback. The forward scored twice in the space of four minutes to leave the visitors needing one goal to go through, and after Jan Vertonghen had headed against the post, Moura's low drive completed his hat-trick to give his side victory on the away goals rule and set up an all-English final against Liverpool. Robert Lewandowski scored a first-leg treble as Borussia Dortmund knocked out Real Madrid in 2013 This was the first year Jurgen Klopp came to the attention of many in the UK, with Borussia Dortmund scoring twice in added time to beat Malaga in the previous round. Still, they weren't fancied to pull up too many trees against Real Madrid, but produced a remarkable first-leg display at the Westfalenstadion. Robert Lewandowski - who would leave a year later for free - scored four times as Real were routed 4-1. The Polish forward was too mobile for Pepe and Sergio Ramos, scoring a second-half treble in front of the yellow wall. Real needed a 3-0 win in the second leg to go through but a fine performance from Klopp's men looked to have done enough. However, two goals in the last 10 minutes, from Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos, ensured a nervy finale as Dortmund just about hung on. John Terry saw red as Chelsea held on to beat Barcelona in 2012 The first leg at Stamford Bridge saw Barcelona come close, but it was Chelsea, through Didier Drogba, who edged ahead 1-0. Back to the Nou Camp and it was the anchorman Sergio Busquets who popped up with a tap-in to level the aggregate scores. It was one-way traffic and soon Chelsea were seriously up against it when captain John Terry saw red for a knee in the back of Alexis Sanchez. Lionel Messi then teed up Andres Iniesta to make it 2-1 on aggregate and Chelsea needed a goal. Ramires was the unlikely man to find it, a superb finish to chip Victor Valdes - all before half-time. Messi then missed a penalty, planting it against the crossbar, before Barcelona, facing defeat on away goals, were caught on the break. Fernando Torres had the whole half to run into, rounded Valdes and rolled in to cap a remarkable win. Avram Grant led Chelsea to their first Champions League final Chelsea came up against their previous semi-final rivals Liverpool, who knocked them out in the last four in both 2004-05 and 2006-07. In a cagey first leg, Liverpool had a one-goal lead thanks to a close-range shot from Dirk Kuyt. However, Chelsea were offered a lifeline in the dying minutes as John Arne Riise nodded a clearing header into his own net. At Stamford Bridge, Didier Drogba gave the Blues the lead in the opening half but opposing forward Fernando Torres levelled after the break. Extra time was needed and Frank Lampard converted a penalty to put Chelsea 3-2 ahead on aggregate before Drogba stepped up again to score his second of the night. Ryan Babel's audacious effort reduced the deficit but it was not enough and Liverpool would not make another semi-final until 2017-18. Kaka scored three goals over the two legs A fantastic start to the tie for Manchester United saw Cristiano Ronaldo put them ahead in the first 10 minutes. But then Kaka entered the scene. The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner collected a pass and glided past United with ease before planting a fine low shot into the far corner. It was a Kaka masterclass and the Brazilian added a beautiful solo goal with his flair too much for United defenders Gabriel Heinze and Patrice Evra. Wayne Rooney did get a leveller and then powered in a superb shot from long range in stoppage time to give United a slender 3-2 lead at the halfway stage of the tie. At the San Siro, it was Kaka once again who proved the difference and his delicious left-footed drive put Milan back ahead on away goals early on. Clarence Seedorf then beat Edwin van der Sar from the edge of the area and Alberto Gilardino provided the coup de grace. Alessandro del Piero starred as Juventus squeezed past Real Madrid in 2003 The first leg was in Madrid and Ronaldo opened the scoring with a superb finish from the edge of the area. Juventus grabbed an away goal on the stroke of half-time when David Trezeguet stabbed in a deflected shot from Alessandro del Piero. Real were back in front when Roberto Carlos' piledriver went through a sea of players and it was on to Turin. Trezeguet spurred Juve's second-leg comeback as his close-range effort put the home side ahead on away goals. Real needed a goal, on came Ronaldo, and he won a penalty with a trademark body swerve. Up stepped Luis Figo, but Gianluigi Buffon saved his spot-kick. It was the key moment as within five minutes Pavel Nedved had outpaced Fernando Hierro to fire in, and while Zinedine Zidane scored against his old team, it was too late. Andrew Cole sealed Man Utd's memorable win against Juventus in 1999 The 1999 Treble win for Manchester United is etched into the public consciousness, even if the final against Bayern Munich was largely quite dull - until the incredible finale. The two-legged semi-final against Juventus was dramatic from start to finish. The first leg at Old Trafford saw future Chelsea boss Antonio Conte strike the Italian giants into an early lead before a second-half United siege finally bore fruit when Ryan Giggs hammered into the roof of the net in the last minute. With the tie all square at 1-1, Juve were favourites in the second leg, even more so when Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Game over? Nobody told Roy Keane. His header gave United hope and he led by example throughout, despite picking up a yellow card that would rule him out of the final. Dwight Yorke headed United level on the night - and ahead on away goals - before half-time in this classic encounter. Inzaghi had a hat-trick 'goal' correctly ruled out for offside, before Andrew Cole tapped in to seal a famous win for United.

Four ways Arteta can mastermind Arsenal comeback v PSG,Four ways Arteta can mastermind Arsenal comeback v PSG,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0r5krkl98do,"PSG have racked up 82 shots (29 on target) when hosting Manchester City, Liverpool and Aston Villa at the intimidating Parc des Princes this season. Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will use ""rage, anger, frustration"" and ""a bad feeling in the tummy"" to try and overturn the 1-0 Champions League semi-final first-leg deficit against Paris St-Germain. For supporters travelling to Paris on Wednesday, the scene of Arsenal's 2006 Champions League final defeat, the stomach churns. Arsenal have not scored in any of their past seven semi-final matches in all competitions (losing five and drawing two). But PSG have their own Champions League ghosts, their own archive of meltdowns. The tie still hangs in the balance. Thomas Partey's return to Arsenal's midfield could be decisive, as could Ousmane Dembele's fitness after only training since Monday. Then there is the tactical battle, won by Luis Enrique in the first leg but, thanks to Mikel Arteta's mid-game tweaks, perhaps set up to swing in Arsenal's favour. Get past the nerves and the historic trauma, and Arsenal supporters have reason to feel optimistic. Four reasons, to be exact. For any pessimistic fans, some good news: the first thing Arsenal have to do can be filed under ""more of the same"". The last 70, that is, not the first 20. PSG overwhelmed Arsenal in the first 20 minutes at the Emirates, cutting through midfield like a knife through butter. They held 77% possession in that spell as wave after wave of attack pushed the hosts back. Enrique's initial setup flummoxed Arsenal's 4-4-2. Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves sat high, pinning Declan Rice and Mikel Merino, which left Ousmane Dembele free to drop off the front line and become the spare man in the middle. Whenever Arsenal's two-man midfield looked to cover Dembele, there was always at least one of those two high eights free. In this example, as shown on Match of the Day, both Ruiz and Neves are free between the lines as Arsenal set up initially in a 4-4-2 shape On Match of the Day, pundit Stephen Warnock explained how Arsenal's Bukayo Saka was breaking out of the 4-4-2 shape ""too early"" which opened up the left-hand side for PSG. So Arteta changed the shape to a 4-2-3-1, below, dropping Martin Odegaard out of the front line and into midfield to track Vitinha. Arsenal now had an extra body in the middle to cope with those intelligent rotations between Vitinha, Neves, and Ruiz, which - coupled with the centre-backs moving more aggressively out to meet Dembele - stopped PSG from dominating. After the opening 20-minute period, Arteta tweaks Arsenal's set-up into a 4-2-3-1 formation. Odegaard sits on Vitinha and Arsenal's midfield five have just one player each to track, solidifying the centre Arsenal grew in confidence and, winning tackles in midfield, started to gain territory and get attackers on the ball. From minutes 21 to 95, Arsenal held 55% possession and out-shot PSG 10-7. Partey's return should help them do that again, only better. He probably would have sniffed out the danger to prevent Dembele's winner last week, and ought to track the PSG midfielders more intelligently than Merino was able to. But all eyes should be on the key battle of the game: Odegaard's man-marking job on Vitinho, the metronome and orchestrator of Enrique's fluid possession football. Across the 'Big Five' leagues in Europe, Vitinha ranks second only to Bayern's Joshua Kimmich for both touches per 90 (117) and passes completed per 90 (98). Stop Vitinha and you probably stop PSG. Either Rice or Merino should have moved across to cover Dembele before his fourth-minute goal In a 4-2-3-1 shape Arsenal should be PSG's equals, immediately solving a lot of problems and creating a more even game territorially. From here, Arteta can move his focus to getting more out of Odegaard when the Gunners have possession, The Norwegian has been criticised by some fans for his lack of big-game impact. ""We had especially one issue that we corrected after 15-20 minutes,"" Arteta said after the first leg. ""We sustained that for the rest of the game, which I think turned the game around."" Pressed further on what he meant, Arteta told reporters it was ""an issue we had with the ball"" adding: ""In a very specific moment, you don't have the chance to present and they decide to bring all the midfielders back, you're going to struggle."" Arteta was probably referring to Odegaard's failure to ""present"" when Arsenal were in possession; he touched the ball just three times in the first 20 minutes. Below, in the 11th minute, Odegaard is nowhere to be seen, forcing William Saliba and David Raya to exchange passes twice before PSG win the ball: Odegaard, roaming too high and out of shot, leaves Saliba (on the ball) without a forward pass Odegaard showed more as the game went on and helped Arsenal build through the thirds, although he still had a limited impact by his high standards. Only 10 of his 30 passes went forward by more than a yard. Odegaard's pass map from the PSG first leg - many of his passes were sideways The solution is to drop Odegaard even deeper. The Arsenal captain thrives when allowed to collect the ball on the right of midfield, getting a feel for possession before starting give-and-goes with team-mates. Notice the difference between Odegaard's heat map from the PSG first leg and from Arsenal's 7-1 victory over PSV Eindhoven earlier in the competition, widely seen as the Norwegian's best performance of the season: Image 1: Odegaard came short, into a deep right midfield position, to run the game against PSV. Image 2: Odegaard playing further forward on average, against PSG 1 of 2 Arteta needs to move Odegaard much deeper, where he can dictate the tempo with press-evading, one-touch passes, not only stopping Arsenal from being caught by the press but linking more fluidly with Saka, too. That's all the learning Arteta can do from the first leg. The rest of his week should have been spent pouring over Aston Villa's remarkable performance in their quarter-final second leg - when they beat PSG 3-2 but lost 4-5 on aggregate. ""I don't think my team has been so dominated by another team in that way,"" Luis Enrique said. ""But this opponent has to take risks because they were going out of the competition. They attacked with great intensity."" That's what Arsenal need to do. Villa's urgency, directness, and fearlessness left PSG in a muddle. Perhaps bearing the scars of collapses past, they gradually dropped deeper until they became overwhelmed by the ball-carrying of Morgan Rodgers and the pace of Marcus Rashford. We've already covered how Arsenal can push PSG back and take control. If they also bravely take risks in possession they can emulate Villa and scramble brains. Their tactical route to doing so is Miles Lewis-Skelley. He briefly became the game's key player last week when he began turning in possession and dribbling around Achraf Hakimi, opening up the pitch. Image 1: Lewis-Skelley's inverted role draws Hakimi in. Image 2: Once turned, the pitch opens up for Arsenal's left-back to drive forward and play Martinelli in behind 1 of 2 Hakimi, caught between marking Gabriel Martinelli and covering Lewis-Skelley when he inverted, might again find himself with too much to do, especially if Rice - freed into a more advanced role now Partey is back - can help create Villa-style chaos by driving forward with the ball. If all of the above goes to plan, Arsenal should win a few more free-kicks and corners than in the first leg. It remains their best route to scoring in Paris. Arsenal have scored 14 set-piece goals in the Premier League this season and produced an expected goals (xG) of 15.91 from dead balls, more than anyone in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues. Meanwhile PSG have conceded 10 set-piece goals in Ligue 1 (six from corners), amounting to 30.35% of their total goals against. That's by far the highest proportion in France and sixth-most in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues. Corners to both the front and back post have been an issue for Enrique's side all season A lot was made of this mismatch before the first leg, only for Arsenal to win just three corners and six free-kicks in the PSG half. Those numbers will climb if Arteta gets his tactical plan right, in turn engineering the kind of set-piece chances that Arsenal have relished over the last few years. That is the four-point tactical path to a famous victory in Paris. Press in a 4-2-3-1 to shut down PSG's midfield rotations; get Odegaard deep to dominate the game; take risks on the ball, and maximise set-pieces.

Titans snatch victory in extraordinary IPL finish,Titans snatch victory in extraordinary IPL finish,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c98g8y1nl96o,"The win means Gujarat close in on a place in the play-off stage Indian Premier League, Mumbai Mumbai Indians 155-8 (20 overs): Jacks 53 (35), Suryakumar 35 (24) Gujarat Titans 147-7 (19 overs): Gill 43 (46), Buttler 30 (27); Bumrah 2-19, Boult 2-22 Gujarat Titans won by three wickets (DLS method) Scorecard Gujarat Titans beat Mumbai Indians - and the rain - to snatch a remarkable final-ball victory and go top of the Indian Premier League. A see-saw match looked to have gone the way of Mumbai when a second rain delay stopped Gujarat's chase with another 24 runs needed from 12 balls - the visitors behind on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method. But the rain stopped and Gujarat's target was adjusted to 147, leaving them 15 to get from the final six balls as the match resumed moments before the cut-off at 00:30 local time. Rahul Tewatia hit the first ball for four and two balls later Gerald Coetzee slammed a straight six to leave four to get from three balls. Bowler Deepak Chahar then overstepped to gift the Titans another run, only for Coetzee to be caught off the penultimate ball with the scores level. New batter Arshad Khan scrambled the one run needed from the last ball for the Titans, although Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya still could have forced a super over but missed with his throw from mid-on when a direct hit would have run out Arshad. The Titans won by three runs via the DLS method. ""It is quite remarkable,"" former England bowler Steven Finn said on BBC Radio 5 Live commentary. ""One over, 15 needed, Coetzee hammers it for six and the tables turned immediately. This game really did have everything apart from a super over."" Titans captain Shubman Gill said: ""There were a lot of emotions, most of them frustrating because at one point we were ahead of the game and it felt like one of those Test match sessions that don't go your way. ""Everything worked out well for us. ""Even after this with so much chaos, wins like these are what get you through in a big tournament."" Who needs what to reach IPL play-offs? IPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport That all came after the visitors were cruising at 107-2 in pursuit of 156 until the first rain delay, after which they lost 4-25 in four overs amid an electric spell of fast bowling from Mumbai's quicks. Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets, Trent Boult one and Ashwani Kumar the other - all of which was in vain for Mumbai who also would have topped the table with a win. Former England captain Jos Buttler scored 30 for the Titans before the rain with a partner of 72 with Gill helped by an 11-ball over from Hardik that included two no-balls and three separate wides. ""My no-balls, and the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20 it is a crime,"" said Hardik. ""It bites you. ""The ball kept getting wetter - I don't know if it helped us or not. It was difficult."" Also wasted by Mumbai was 53 from 35 balls by England all-rounder Will Jacks in Mumbai's 155-8. Jacks, whose fifty was his first for the franchise, put on 73 with Suryakumar Yadav but Mumbai lost 6-58 after Suryakumar was dismissed for 35. The Titans move level on points with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, but sit top of the table courtesy of their superior net run-rate. Mumbai stay in the play-off places in fourth but, having played a game more than those below them, have work to do to qualify for the play-offs.

After every race he'd always have a chat back in the pits, he'd ask me how my race went, I'd ask about his and he'd give me advice on how to get better and where to improve,"" McLaren-Wood said. ""He was such a loving dad. I can't imagine what they're going through right now, it's so sudden and unexpected."" McLaren-Wood said he did not know Jenner ""as much as I would have liked"". Jenner, from Crowborough in East Sussex, started his racing career in Junior Motorcross before progressing to the tarmac. He won the 2018 Team Green, 2020 Junior Supersport and 2023 Junior Superstock titles. Jenner joined the Kramer Team for the 2024 British GP2 season, winning the title with 18 wins out of 20 race finishes. Englishman Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson, of New Zealand, died in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire Fatalities are rare in motorbike racing, but unfortunately not unheard of. British Superbikes rider Chrissy Rouse died after a crash at Donington Park in 2022. Superbikes can reach speeds of up to 200mph, and the bikes used in Supersport regularly clock well in excess of 100mph. Former rider and MLav Racing owner Michael Laverty told BBC Sport that the riders were probably reaching speeds of ""about 90 to 100mph"" when they crashed on the opening corner of Oulton Park on the first lap. McLaren-Wood, who races for Josh Davis Motorsport By UGGLY & Co Kawasaki, expects the incident to impact some of the riders, but insisted they all enter the sport knowing the risks. ""I think it will affect a few people,"" McLaren-Wood said. ""Most of us out there know it's the sport we love to do and we will go out there fighting again, and avoid anything like that happening again."" Motorsport Vision Racing (MSV), who are responsible for circuit operations at Oulton Park, and the Motorcycle Racing Control Board (MCRCB) said on Monday they are ""investigating the full circumstances of the incident in conjunction with the Coroner and Cheshire Constabulary"". ""I think there are always ways to improve in safety in elite sport,"" McLaren-Wood said when asked what the sport could learn. ""Maybe there were too many riders out there, I don't really know. I'm not a safety expert, but I think it was mostly a tragedy."" The Oulton Park event marked the beginning of the 2025 British Superbikes season, with a further seven rounds set to take place across the UK before three 'showdown' events. The Supersport Championship is a support class to the main British Superbike series. The next event of the British Supersport Championship season takes place at Donington Park on 16-18 May.

Ronaldo's son gets first Portugal Under-15s call-up,Ronaldo's son gets first Portugal Under-15s call-up,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm242ye9ppdo,"Cristiano Ronaldo and his son are both at Al-Nassr Cristiano's Ronaldo's eldest son has been called up to the Portugal Under-15s squad for the first time. The 14-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo Jr is at Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia with his father, who signed for the Pro League club in December 2022. Portugal great Ronaldo, 40, posted a picture on social media of his son's name on the national team squad list along with the message, ""Proud of you, son"". Ronaldo Jr has been called up for a youth tournament , external in Croatia between 13-18 May, with Portugal scheduled to play Japan, Greece and England. Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo Sr is still a Portugal international and has scored 136 goals for his country - a world record in men's football. The 40-year-old captained Portugal to their first major title at Euro 2016, although he had to agonisingly watch the majority of the final from the sidelines after suffering an injury in the 25th-minute. Ronaldo also led his national side to the Nations League title in 2019. In March, Ronaldo scored but missed a penalty as Portugal dramatically beat Denmark to reach the Nations League semi-finals. The ex-Manchester United forward has four other children - twins Eva and Mateo, 7, Alana Martina, 7, and Bella, 3. Ronaldo Jr's youth career has played out in tandem with his father's journey around the world - featuring in the academies of Real Madrid, Juventus, Manchester United and Al-Nassr. Reports claim , external he scored 58 goals in a season during his time with Italian giants Juventus. He played alongside Wayne Rooney's son, Kai, in the youth set-up at Manchester United when Ronaldo Sr returned for a second stint at Old Trafford. Videos of the teenager striking Ronaldo Sr's iconic 'Siu' celebration have gone viral while playing for Al-Nassr. Although he has been called-up by Portugal's under-15 side for next month's tournament, Ronaldo Jr is also eligible to play for his country of birth - the United States - or Spain due to residency when his father turned out for Real Madrid.

Real trying to sign Alexander-Arnold in time for Club World Cup,Real seek to sign Alexander-Arnold for Club World Cup,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1lm00mp1elo,"Alexander-Arnold won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with Liverpool Real Madrid are aiming to complete the signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold before the start of the Club World Cup. The England defender has confirmed he will leave Liverpool when his contract expires this summer and the 26-year-old is expected to join the Spanish club as a free agent. Alexander-Arnold's contract with Liverpool expires on 30 June but the Club World Cup begins 16 days earlier. BBC Sport understands Real have approached Liverpool with a view to negotiating a deal to release Alexander-Arnold in time for the full-back to be part of their plans for the Fifa-organised tournament in the United States. It is understood the Spanish club are considering an offer of about £850,000 to release Alexander-Arnold early from his deal. It has also been suggested Real might be willing to pay the wages Liverpool owe Alexander-Arnold as they seek a solution. Discussions between all parties are described as amicable. World football governing body Fifa has confirmed there will be a short initial transfer window this summer - running from 1 to 10 June - which is designed for clubs competing in the Club World Cup to amend their squads in time for the competition. Real's desire to land Alexander-Arnold in time for the tournament presents an opportunity for Liverpool to recoup at least some money for a high-value player who will otherwise leave Anfield for no fee.

'Calamity keeper' or 'human wall' - which Donnarumma will Arsenal face?,'Calamity keeper' or 'human wall' - which Donnarumma will Arsenal face?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr5d9162g23o,"Gianluigi Donnarumma made two superb saves to keep out Arsenal last week - this stop from Gabriel Martinelli, and another to deny Leandro Trossard A calamity keeper or the human wall? Arsenal's Champions League fate could be decided by which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France on Wednesday. Will they be thwarted again by the shot-stopper extraordinaire we saw in last week's semi-final first leg, when the giant Italian's long arms ensured Paris St-Germain escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win? Or could we see the return of the error-prone flapper who was left clutching at thin air as the Gunners scored from two crosses in a group-stage victory in October, where the 26-year-old put in the kind of unconvincing display that has put his entire future at the club in doubt? Arsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, so it probably doesn't help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign. His supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go. Still, if you support England, or even other English teams, you may be wondering why anyone doubts Donnarumma - after all, he has already been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season, and showed the world his prowess at stopping penalties when he helped Italy overcome the Three Lions in the shoot-out that settled the final of Euro 2020. Italy win in penalty shootout against England to become European champions He has performed plenty of heroics down the years, but PSG fans don't just remember Donnarumma for his big saves because, since he arrived on a free transfer from AC Milan in 2021, there have been plenty of bad errors too. In any case, much more is expected of a modern-day goalkeeper than just keeping the ball out of the net, and his distribution with his feet is seen as another weakness. So, does that drop him down the pecking order when we consider who is the best keeper on the planet, or is he just more proof that the perfect all-round player in his position does not exist? BBC Sport spoke to former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson about what makes Donnarumma special, and asked French football journalist Julien Laurens why PSG are considering replacing him this summer. Is Gianluigi Donnarumma's criticism justified? Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer Gianluigi Donnarumma saved two penalties in the shootout that saw PSG get past Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League At 6ft 5in, Donnarumma's sheer size makes him an imposing figure, physically. That clearly helps when he is facing a penalty - just ask Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Darwin Nunez or Curtis Jones - but it is where he puts his enormous frame when he is dealing with shots or onrushing strikers in open play that impresses Robinson more than anything else. ""He's massive, but his positional awareness in his box is excellent,"" Robinson told BBC Sport. ""That's down to the depth perception he has when he is reading a through ball and his understanding of where his line is. ""A lot of goalkeepers get sucked into rushing off their line to try to close down the angle and to close down the shot, and they think they are in a better position further away from the goal. It is something I did myself sometimes, and you find the shot is past you before you are ready. ""What Donnarumma does instead, very cleverly, is stay closer to his line, maybe two or three yards away. Because of his size he knows he can cover most of his goal from there anyway. ""The save he made low down with his left hand from Trossard's shot last week was the perfect example of that, and of him knowing exactly where he is in relation to his line. ""As Trossard runs into the box, if Donnarumma is three or four yards further forward, like a lot of goalkeepers would be, that shot goes past him. Instead, he holds his position, and makes the save on the angle. ""It is a brilliant save and it is his physique that allows him to make it, but also down to his technique and his positional awareness, which is second to none."" While his form has fluctuated, Donnarumma's contract situation is the main reason why his future is uncertain. He has one year left on the five-year deal he signed when he joined PSG, and has reportedly been in talks about an extension. According to his agent, Enzo Raiola, Donnarumma wants to stay - but he has been also been linked to a summer return to Serie A, and Milan, with Inter, while it appears PSG may have alternatives in mind too. ""The club are taking their time to decide what to do,"" explained French football journalist Laurens. ""They like Lucas Chevalier at Lille a lot and Luis Campos (PSG's football advisor in charge of recruitment) knows Chevalier well from when he was there."" Chevalier was reported to be one of Manchester United's targets before they signed Andre Onana as David de Gea's replacement. He helped Lille beat Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the group stage of this season's Champions League before the French side lost to Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 Chevalier, 23, is known for his passing proficiency as well as his saving ability and is seen as the future of French goalkeeping. He broke into the senior squad for the first time at the end of 2024, although he is yet to make his senior debut for Les Bleus. ""PSG have not made their minds up,"" added Laurens. ""Can they really get an upgrade on Donnarumma and, if so, is Chevalier that player? ""Any money they get for Donnarumma – maybe £25-30m - would be pure profit, but then it would probably cost around £50m to get Chevalier, so what do they do? ""The problem they have with Donnarumma is not on his line, where he is great - everyone at the club recognises that. It is just I think (PSG boss) Luis Enrique would rather have a good goalkeeper who is better with the ball at his feet. ""Still, it is a difficult decision. Of course it is ideal if you can get everything you need in a goalkeeper, but I am not sure Chevalier has everything yet."" PSG were in complete control of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022 until Benzema caught Donnarumma in possession and scored. He went on to score a 17-minute hat-trick to send Real into the quarter-finals It is Donnarumma's mistakes that have led some PSG fans to lose patience with him, and seen him targeted by the French media, with one performance in particular proving hard to forget. ""He got some criticism recently for Harvey Elliott's goal against Liverpool, which was bad, then he made a mistake when they lost to Nice too, when their first goal went under his arm,"" Laurens said. ""For a long time, though, he has been seen as just not being good enough at crosses or set-pieces. Kai Havertz put Arsenal ahead in their group-stage win over PSG in October, capitalising when Donnarumma failed to deal with a Leandro Trossard cross ""He has tried to work on that, just like he has tried to improve with the ball at his feet, but I don't see much of an improvement with any of his weaknesses. ""I think also he still carries with him his worst moment, the Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022. ""PSG were 1-0 up at the Bernabeu with 30 minutes to go after winning the first leg 1-0 too, but then Karim Benzema kind of barged into Donnarumma, got the ball off him and scored - and then Benzema scored two more goals quickly and PSG were out. ""A lot of fans remember that moment, and they feel that there is another mistake coming somewhere, but every time we see him doing well, that surely gets him more points to stay and have his contract extended than the other way around."" Donnarumma may have his detractors but the stats are on his side - new data ranks him higher than any other goalkeeper in the world. The CIES Football Observatory Index takes into account the level of games played plus results, and also measures the quality of chances faced at domestic level to look at the how the number of expected goals from those chances compare to how many were conceded. It places Donnarumma above Yann Sommer of Inter Milan and Real Madrid's Thibault Courtois at the top of a list which has a couple of notable omissions - Liverpool's Alisson and Manchester City's Ederson both fail to make the top 20. Donnarumma has won 72 caps for Italy and played 251 games for AC Milan before joining PSG in 2021. He has played 151 games all competitions for the French side, and has won Ligue 1 four times Robinson used a different criteria, including his eyes, to come up with an alternative top three where Alisson does appear, along with Donnarumma. ""For me, Alisson is the best in the world, because he hasn't forgotten the fundamentals of goalkeeping, which are to keep the ball out of the net,"" Robinson explained. ""Commanding your box, communicating with your back four, stopping shots and dealing with one on ones are all part of that, but he can adapt to the modern way of playing out from the back too, without taking it to the next level like Ederson does. ""Ederson is the best with his feet but for the all-round package there is Alisson, Jan Oblak at Atletico Madrid and Donnarumma, and you can put those three in the same bracket. ""To be the very best you need the right mindset too, and Donnarumma has that. He has played so many games since his debut for AC Milan aged 16 that he is much more experienced than most keepers his age. ""That maturity means he is comfortable on the biggest stage, and can make a difference the way he has done so many times already. ""There is this uncertainty about where he will be next year but I bet PSG are glad they have got him at the moment - if they go on to win the Champions League this season, he will play a huge part in that.""

Raducanu set-up 'working well' but jigsaw not complete,Raducanu set-up 'working well' but jigsaw not complete,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cp3139wv6vno,"Emma Raducanu is playing at the Italian Open for just the second time in her career Britain's Emma Raducanu believes her current coaching arrangement is working well but knows she will soon need to ""figure another solution out"". The 22-year-old still has a desire to develop a longer-term partnership with Mark Petchey, even if the pair were unable to agree a more exclusive arrangement. But Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) national women's coach who is alongside Petchey at this week's Italian Open, is only on a sabbatical from her current full-time job in finance. ""It's been working pretty well,"" Raducanu told BBC Sport in Rome. ""Mark is doing his commentary work and around that he is going to help me as much as he can and hopefully the times align that he can be there with me in the matches. ""That's why Jane is here for when he's not able to make it to the session. ""While she's not working it's nice to have her as much as possible, but she will go back to work and then I need to figure another solution out."" Sinner doping ban deal 'best choice in bad moment' How Draper has become a force on clay - Second Serve Sabalenka beats spirited Gauff to win Madrid Open The aim is to find someone who can act in a support role to Petchey, who has significant broadcast commitments throughout the year. ""I just need to work on who that person is,"" Raducanu added. However, former Great Britain number one Dan Evans cast doubt on the feasibility of Raducanu's arrangement with Petchey. ""It can't last if she starts losing matches and Petchey is in the commentary box. That's not going to work,"" Evans, 34, told 5 Live Tennis. ""I think Emma will be looking for a new coach again pretty soon if she starts to lose some matches on the grass into the US swing. I'm not sure how that can last as it is."" Petchey will be able to devote more time to Raducanu during the grass-court season, and the work they have been doing on the practice court is not purely targeted at clay courts. Raducanu lost to Marta Kostyuk in the Madrid Open second round in April and says she does not ""necessarily feel very comfortable"" on the surface. ""I feel slightly better than I did in Madrid,"" she said. ""I want to use this period of the clay season to try and work on certain things in my game that I think are going to help me bridge the gap to the next level. ""I want to take more balls on, I want to be more aggressive in certain points - I want to structure the points more on my terms. ""I know I may make more errors doing that, but I'm willing to go through that."" World number 49 Raducanu begins her Rome campaign against a qualifier on Wednesday. Raducanu also addressed how ""nervous"" she feels about the risk of ingesting contaminated medicine, or even being deliberately targeted when eating in a restaurant. Jannik Sinner returned to the ATP Tour this week after a three-month doping ban, having been inadvertently contaminated by a steroid cream his physiotherapist had applied to his own hands before treating the world number one. Women's world number two Iga Swiatek also served a one-month ban after testing positive after taking contaminated melatonin tablets. ""I don't want to take anything even if the doctors are saying you should take this - just out of risk of contamination,"" Raducanu added. ""Even if it's not prohibited on the anti-doping list, you don't know if it's contaminated by another product. ""It can show a green tick, but if it's contaminated you will still get screwed over. ""We could go to a restaurant [and someone could put something in our drink]. It's really hard, especially if you are noticeable and the waiter recognises you. ""It's something I do worry about - it's nervous every time.""

Learning from Pochettino & aiding Okocha - how PSG loan shaped Arteta,Learning from Pochettino & aiding Okocha - how PSG loan shaped Arteta,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyv7575qneo,"Mikel Arteta made 53 appearances for Paris St-Germain during an 18-month loan spell In January 2001 Mikel Arteta left Barcelona for Paris St-Germain in a move that would ultimately help transform one of the most intelligent midfielders of his generation into one of the game’s top coaches. It was where he first displayed the leadership qualities that have seen him progress to Arsenal manager and he will welcome PSG to Emirates Stadium on Tuesday in the Champions League. The 18-year-old Arteta, faced with the impossible task of usurping the likes of Pep Guardiola, French World Cup winner Emmanuel Petit, Dutch international Phillip Cocu and Xavi Hernandez in Barcelona’s star-studded midfield, had moved to the French capital on an 18-month loan deal. PSG were yet to become French football’s dominant force but had progressed to the second group stage of the Champions League and boasted several big names of their own, including Jay-Jay Okocha, Nicolas Anelka and Mauricio Pochettino. A young Brazilian by the name of Ronaldinho would join the club from Gremio later that year. Arteta barely spoke any French, but a small contingent of Spanish speakers helped him settle quickly into life in Ligue 1 and despite his tender years, the teenager made a big impression at the Parc des Princes. A young Arteta (3rd left) in training with his PSG team-mates One of the first players to take Arteta under his wing was Pochettino, who the Spaniard has since described as his “big brother” and “football father”. The Argentine, 10 years his senior, also arrived in January 2001 after leaving La Liga side Espanyol and struck up a close bond with his new team-mate as they shared a hotel for the first three months of their time in Paris. Arteta’s leadership skills, according to Pochettino, were apparent from the outset. “He was already a coach,” he said of his former PSG colleague in 2023. “He was giving advice to me and the others. [I’d] say ‘wow!’ – the character, the personality, the charisma. He already had the football brain.” Arteta grateful for early-career support from Pochettino Arteta was tasked by manager Luis Fernandez – who had already tried to sign the teenager while in charge of Athletic Bilbao – with orchestrating play from a deep-lying midfield position, a role he fulfilled with a confidence and maturity that belied his age. “Fernandez asked him to play simply and help provide a platform for more creative talents like Okocha, and he carried it out brilliantly,” French football expert Matt Spiro told BBC Sport. “Arteta was a quiet man but already displayed the steely determination we see in him today. Like most Barcelona players he was technically excellent, but the most surprising and impressive aspect of his game, given his age, was his tactical awareness.” Arteta made 11 appearances before the end of the campaign, scoring his first PSG goal in a 2-2 draw with Lille on the season’s penultimate weekend. Despite his fine start, however, Fernandez’s side ended that term in inauspicious fashion. After losing 4-0 to Auxerre in the French Cup fourth round – Arteta’s debut for the club – they finished bottom of their second-round group in the Champions League and only narrowly clinched a top-half finish on the final day of the season. But better times were just around the corner. Arteta: The making of Mikel PSG manager Luis Fernandez (left) had tried to sign Arteta (right) during his time in charge of Athletic Bilbao Victory in that summer’s Intertoto Cup earned Les Parisiens a place in the first round proper of the 2001-02 Uefa Cup. Including those early-season European games, PSG won eight and drew 10 of their first 18 matches of the campaign, eventually suffering their first defeat at Bordeaux on the final day of September. Arteta played the full 90 minutes in all but one of his 16 league appearances before Christmas, as PSG placed themselves firmly in the mix for a return to the Champions League the following season. “The team had style on the pitch,” Fernandez, who remembers Arteta as a player with “good etiquette and behaviour”, told The Athletic last year. “They always met my expectations in relation to the system and the organisation. We were able to make them evolve and grow as players. I am happy to have been able to help them, and Mikel.” PSG would again fall short in France’s domestic cup competitions, losing in the French Cup quarter-finals and League Cup semi-finals to Lorient and Bordeaux respectively. But it was a penalty-shootout defeat by Rangers in the Uefa Cup round of 32 that would prove costly in more ways than one, as it marked the beginning of the end of Arteta’s time at the club. The Glasgow outfit, who knew little of the teenager before the first-leg meeting in late November, were so impressed by his performance across both matches that they decided to offer Barcelona – who by that time had Andres Iniesta knocking on the first-team door – £6m for his services. Fernandez had reportedly made the permanent acquisition of Arteta one of his top priorities, but despite holding a purchase option for the midfielder, PSG were beaten to his signature by Alex McLeish’s side, who agreed a deal in March for Arteta to join in the summer. Arteta on ‘survive or die’ at Rangers Arteta caught the eye of the Rangers hierarchy during a Uefa Cup meeting in late 2001 Confirmation of his imminent departure did little to sour Arteta’s relationship with the fans at PSG, who ended their Ligue 1 campaign in fourth spot – insufficient for a Champions League return but a marked improvement on ninth the previous year, and enough at least to guarantee Uefa Cup football for another season. Arteta ended 2001-02 on 42 appearances in all competitions, his modest return of eight goal involvements misrepresentative of the overall impact he had during his loan spell. As PSG supporters prepare to travel to Emirates Stadium on 1 October, conversations among a certain vintage may turn to their former midfield orchestrator who, in the intervening decades, has blossomed into one of the brightest tactical minds in the game. “Arteta was a major success during his 18 months at PSG,” said Spiro. “Everybody was disappointed they didn’t manage to keep him longer. “They didn’t win any trophies, but fans still recall that period – and Arteta – with great fondness.” Latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views Get Arsenal news sent straight to your phone Champions League reaction as Inter beat Barcelona in thriller to reach final 'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end 'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls Preview the forthcoming drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103 Watchlist Add BBC Trailers to your Watchlist in iPlayer A gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean Bean Watchlist Add This City Is Ours to your Watchlist in iPlayer Stacey Dooley explores Britain’s shoplifting epidemic Watchlist Add Stacey Dooley to your Watchlist in iPlayer Rock group, Jethro Tull, at home, in the studio and on tour Watchlist Add The Lively Arts to your Watchlist in iPlayer 'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?

Inter beat Barca in all-time classic to reach Champions League final,Inter beat Barca in all-time classic to reach Champions League final,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/crrz42r8ve4t,"Inter Milan match-winner Davide Frattesi came on as a 79th-minute substitute for Henrikh Mkhitaryan Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of added time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie, the 37-year-old charging around with his shirt off in wild celebrations. And there were more ecstatic scenes when substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra time before climbing up a security fence to celebrate in front of Inter's fans. It means a second Champions League final in three seasons for three-time European champions Inter after two legs of incredible drama which saw 13 goals and a tie turned on its head on several occasions. Barca were only two minutes away from their first final in 10 years having fought back from 2-0 down - in a similar scenario to the first leg - to lead 3-2 on the night. Lamine Yamal almost took the game to penalties but was twice denied by superb saves by Yann Sommer as Inter held on to reach the final and spark incredible scenes of celebration. Inter, who lost 1-0 to Manchester City in the 2023 final, will play either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday, 31 May in the 2025 showpiece. The Gunners head into Wednesday's second leg in France after losing 1-0 at Emirates Stadium last week. 'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals? Lautaro Martinez scored his ninth goal in this season's Champions League, the most by any Inter Milan player in an edition of the competition, overtaking Samuel Eto'o in 2011 (eight goals) This semi-final will go down as one of the best in the tournament's history. Just like in the first leg in Spain, Inter raced into a 2-0 lead, only to be pegged by Barcelona. After Lautaro Martinez had put Inter ahead following good work from team-mate Denzel Dumfries, Hakan Calhanoglu converted a penalty at the end of the first half to leave Barcelona 5-3 behind on aggregate and in massive trouble. But Hansi Flick's side dominated the second half. Former Manchester City defender Eric Garcia volleyed one back for Barcelona before Dani Olmo's fine diving header in the 60th minute from Gerard Martin's cross made it 2-2 on the night and 5-5 on aggregate. Raphinha grabbed what appeared to be an 87th-minute winner as Barca went ahead for the first time in the tie, when he converted a rebound after Sommer had saved his first strike. Inter saved themselves, although Yamal had a chance to win the tie in the sixth minute of stoppage time only for Sommer to make a vital stop. The hosts then retook the lead in extra time, but Barca still created chances, only for substitute Robert Lewandowski to head over and for 17-year-old Yamal to be denied by Sommer's superb one-handed save. This tie was the joint-highest scoring semi-final tie in the Champions League history, matching the 13 goals scored when Liverpool defeated Roma 7-6 on aggregate in 2017-18. Inter Milan fans displayed a colourful and spectacular tifo around the San Siro before the match started Lamine Yamal was seven years old when Barcelona were last European champions Inter won the European Cup in 1964 and 1965 and clinched the Champions League in 2010, when Jose Mourinho guided them to a 2-0 win in the final against Bayern Munich. No Italian side has won the competition since then with Juventus losing in the 2015 and 2017 finals, before Rodri scored the only goal for Manchester City against Inter in the final two years ago. Simone Inzaghi was Inter's manager then and he has again plotted a route to the final, while also taking them in contention to win a second successive Italian Serie A title as they are second, three points behind leaders Napoli with three games to go. Meanwhile, Barcelona have been European champions five times, but have not reached the final since their last success in 2015. They still have a chance to grab their third domestic trophy this season as they hold a four-point lead at the top of La Liga over reigning champions Real Madrid. Barca entertain Real in El Clasico on Sunday and a victory would go a long way to securing a 28th Spanish title - and only their second in the past six campaigns. Flick's side have already won the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de Espana this season, beating Real in both finals.

Kvitova seals first win of comeback at Italian Open,Kvitova seals first win of comeback at Italian Open,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c3wxwelqly0o,"Petra Kvitova won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014 Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova won her first match since the birth of her first child, then said she had been close to quitting tennis. The Czech claimed a 7-5 6-1 win over Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round of the Italian Open in Rome. Her victory ended a run of four defeats since the 35-year-old returned to competitive action after 15 months away during which she gave birth to her son Petr. Kvitova, who won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014 and reached number two in the world, said she had doubted whether she would return to the international arena. ""I was 95% that I would never come back. I had enough of tennis at that time. I was like, 'I can't do it any more' - so we decided to try for a baby,"" she told the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) website. ""I didn't say anything because it wasn't 100%. When I could do something finally after pregnancy, I played some tennis and it felt so good. I was laughing. Every shot I hit smoothly, I was like, 'Wow - it's still there'."" Kvitova will now play world number 36 Ons Jabeur of Tunisia in the second round of the tournament played on the clay courts of the Foro Italico. Great Britain's Sonay Kartal fought back from a set down to book her place in the second round at the expense of Kimberly Birrell. Kartal saw off the Australian 4-6 6-3 6-4 in a gruelling match which lasted two hours and 10 minutes. The 23-year-old, who was ranked outside the world's top 250 a year ago but is now up to number 56, will play 30th seed Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic next. British number three Kartal won her only WTA tour title at the Jasmin Open in Tunisia last year. Meanwhile, Cameron Norrie was beaten by Dusan Lajovic of Serbia in three sets in qualifying but was handed a place in the main draw as one of three lucky losers. Norrie struggled during a one-sided opening set which Lajovic won 6-1, but rallied and took the second 6-4 to level the contest. The British number three lost the deciding set 6-3, only to get a reprieve later in the day after Zizou Bergs, Jan-Lennard Struff and Benjamin Bonzi all withdrew through injury. Norrie will face world number 81 Christopher O'Connell of Australia.

Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g3ldd20vo,"The BBC has announced plans to make a Call the Midwife film as well as a prequel TV series set during the Second World War. It comes as filming begins for the 15th series of the BBC One drama, which follows a group of nurse midwives working in London's East End from the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will ""delve into the deeper past"", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The new, separate film and prequel projects will be written, created and produced by Thomas and executive producers Dame Pippa Harris and Ann Tricklebank, who will also oversee the production of series 16 of the programme together. The prequel series will feature ""some familiar (if much younger) faces"", Thomas said. She said that while she has ""never run out of stories for our midwives"", she had found herself ""yearning to delve into the deeper past"" than the years 1957 to 1971 which have been covered by the show. ""The Blitz years in the East End were extraordinary - filled with loss, togetherness, courage and joy,"" she said. Meanwhile, the film will see the ""much-loved"" regular characters ""take a short break from Poplar and test themselves in an unfamiliar landscape"", Ms Thomas said. The location of the film remains ""top secret"", she added - but said it would look ""absolutely fantastic"" on the big screen. The first series of the show was originally inspired by the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, who worked as a midwife and nurse in the community in Poplar. Dame Pippa said the prequel series and film project were being made partly for a ""new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face."" The 15th series will begin with a two-part Christmas special which will see characters travelling to Hong Kong on a mercy mission."
27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xvd10xv5o,"Monday night marked one of the world's biggest nights of fashion, as stars served up their most iconic looks for the annual Met Gala in New York City. The theme for this year's event was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"", the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. It was inspired by a newly unveiled exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume institute featuring the ""black dandy"", which Vogue says ""examines the importance of clothing and style to the formation of black identities in the Atlantic diaspora"". A-list celebrities including Zendaya, Demi Moore and Diana Ross brought their own interpretation to the theme, stunning in tailored suits and dramatic gowns. Here is a look at some of the highlights: Actress Zendaya, known for her dazzling red carpet style, opted for a wide-brimmed hat and tailored Louis Vuitton cream suit at this year's Met Gala. But there was one slight pop of colour: her manicured red nails. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny wore a brown Prada suit, which he said he worked on with the Italian fashion house for a few months before the event. He also stayed on theme by accessorising with embellished gloves, a brooch and a hat that paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage. ""We did something special,"" he said of his look. ""I feel good, and I hope people think I'm looking good."" US reality TV star Kim Kardashian wore an all-black ensemble by LA-based brand Chrome Hearts - a fitted leather top and skirt that she offset with diamond necklaces and two strings of pearls. She is, of course, no stranger to the Met Gala - having made headlines with a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in 2022, and a wet-look Thierry Mugler dress in 2019. Black British designer Grace Wales Bonner dressed British Formula One star Sir Lewis Hamilton for the night. Sir Lewis was a co-chair of this year's event. The pair have worked together in the past with Wales Bonner dressing Hamilton for the 2023 British Fashion Awards. Singer Chappell Roan brought a rare pop of colour to the Met's blue carpet, in a patchwork hot pink ensemble sourced from eBay. The singer worked with Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell on her outfit, while make-up artist Pat McGrath was behind her disco-inspired look. Demi Moore gave us another round of method dressing. The American actress's recent press tour for The Substance recalled the body horror themes of the film, while her awards campaign for the role of Elisabeth Sparkle saw her dressing for the glam statuettes. Moore understood the assignment for the Met Gala, coming as a literal men's tie in a sculptural black and white striped sequin gown from Thom Browne. Rihanna, typically one of the most stylish attendees at the Gala, returned to the Met steps this year in Marc Jacobs, debuting her pregnancy with co-chair of the evening A$AP Rocky. Legendary singer Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble, complete with feathers and a long train that required at least two assistants. On the carpet, Ross said her son persuaded her to attend this year's event. The last time she attended the Met Gala is 2003. She added she had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered on her dress train. Actress Sydney Sweeney wore a custom Miu Miu gown - her third time wearing the designer at the Met Gala. This time, her dress was complete with beaded fringe shoulders and gold hardware detailing on the neck. Speaking about her look, Sweeney said it paid homage to actress and painter Kim Novak. Sweeney is set to portray Novak in the upcoming film Scandalous. A custom-made Chanel look was Dua Lipa's choice this year. The chiffon dress, sequin tweed jacket and organza cape - all adorned with pearls, feathers and crystals - took some 2,000 hours to make. Sabrina Carpenter wore a burgundy Louis Vuitton bodysuit that featured all the tailoring of a regular suit. The singer said she worked with recording artist Pharrell Williams - also the men's creative director of Louis Vuitton - on the bottomless look. ""You're quite short, so no pants for you,"" Carpenter recalled Williams telling her. Irish actor Barry Keoghan wore a custom-made Valentino fit, with florals embroidered on the cuffs and a silk red scarf wrapped around the waist. New Zealand singer Lorde made a rare appearance at the Met Gala this year (she has not attended since 2021). She wore a metallic silver floor-length skirt set, and a matching bandeau and blazer designed by Thom Browne. Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Simone Biles brought a pop of colour to the Met Gala carpet with a striking blue minidress that featured a collared neckline, a long train and jewelled appliques. The dress was designed by Harbison Studio. Singer Coco Jones opted for a look designed by Indian brand Manish Malhotra. She wore a tailored cream and white look that featured ornate embroidery and a dramatic long-sleeve coat. Jones also wore a large statement necklace and Jimmy Choo heels. Actor and playwright Colman Domingo could have inspired this year's Met Gala theme, as he's been carrying the baton for well-dressed men on the red carpet for several years now. He donned a royal blue Valentino cloak that paid homage to Andre Leon Talley, former editor-at-large on Vogue whom Anna Wintour called ""a dandy among dandies."" The cape later was removed to reveal a second look underneath: a tailored, patterned suit complete with a big fabric, polka-dotted flower brooch. Actress and singer Teyana Taylor, who hosted Vogue's live stream of the red carpet, arrived in custom Marc Jacobs on the arm of costume designer Ruth E. Carter. Ms Carter has worked with filmmaker Spike Lee and on the Black Panther movie franchise to create some modern pop cultural cues for the black dandy. Taylor wore a burgundy cape embroidered with ""Harlem Rose,"" a nod to her 2018 song A Rose in Harlem. Social media influencer Emma Chamberlain looked sharp and on theme with a backless tailored suit dress designed by French fashion house Courrèges. She accessorised the look with a spiky beach blonde pixie cut and stylish eyeglasses. Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, known for her on-theme style, wore a Givenchy ensemble featuring a bedazzled bodice and an extra-long black train with matching leather boots and nails. Recording artist Doja Cat wore a custom Marc Jacobs look that featured giant shoulder pads and a leopard-print bustier panel. ""I just wanted to feel like a little gangsta,"" she said. ""I feel like he brought that with the strong shape of the shoulders, and all of the exaggerated shapes,"" Doja Cat said of Jacobs. Actress Tracee Ellis Ross, the daughter of Diana Ross, was one of the few people who wore pink at this year's Met Gala. She donned a custom Marc Jacobs suit that was complete with a giant, hot pink bow at the back, a matching top hat and some unique bling. In one of the more memorable looks of the evening, Andre 3000 showed up to the Met Gala carpet with a black and white piano strapped to his back and a trash bag as a purse. The stylish OutKast rapper designed the look himself in collaboration with Burberry. Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o wore a stunning powder blue Chanel suit, with a matching hat and transparent cape. She accessorised the look with bedazzled, black rhinestone eyebrows. Rapper Cardi B debuted a new hairstyle (and eye colour) in a green Burberry pantsuit, complete with matching nails and eye shadow. Doechii took brand representation to new levels, stamping the famous Louis Vuitton logo on her face to go along with the motif of her suit. The American rapper is often seen wearing looks from the French fashion house. This outfit combined the designer's two famous patterns - the LV monogram pattern on the waistcoat and jacket, as well as the damier checkerboard on the shorts. When asked about her outfit on the carpet, Janelle Monáe responded simply - ""free"" - followed by an expletive. ""And when I'm in my suit, that is exactly how I feel,"" she said. She wore a Thom Brown suit, with whom she's attended the Met Gala as a guest for the last several years. The look is styled by the Academy Award-winning costume designer for Wicked, Paul Tazewell. Pop legend Madonna accessorised her cream-colored tuxedo with a cigar, creating an interplay between soft feminine materials and a distinct masculine energy. It's a dynamic that the superstar has played with throughout her career."
Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g03g71qno,"The home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant Khrystyna Starykova has been destroyed by Russian shelling in the city of Myrnograd. The 19-year-old is currently in Switzerland rehearsing for her performance with the band Ziferblat, but posted photos of her damaged apartment block in the Sviltly neighbourhood. ""Home. And I dreamed so much of returning home,"" she captioned the post, which showed the building shrouded in smoke, with its windows blown out and several balconies collapsed. ""Fortunately, all my relatives and friends are alive and well,"" she said, and vowed to perform at Eurovision next week ""for the sake of our country"". ""[I want] to show what a strong people we are."" In an interview with Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne, Starykova said she had almost anticipated the destruction of her home. ""Four months ago, my grandmother lost her home - it was just such a big hole,"" she said. ""Then my aunt lost the roof over her head. ""I understood that maybe I could be the next one and, unfortunately, it happened. It's very terrible news. I had really hoped to go back."" The singer's home is less than five miles from the frontline, near the industrial city of Pokrovsk, a key battleground on Ukraine's eastern front. In a new Instagram post on Tuesday morning, she shared further footage of Myrnograd's bomb-damaged streets. ""I always went home from vocal lessons this way,"" she wrote in the caption. ""It was my favourite way home."" Ziferblat will represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest with Bird of Pray, a song telling the story of Ukrainians who have been separated from their loved ones by the war with Russia. ""It's about our problems we go through, the tragedy for the last three years,"" singer Valentyn Leshchynskyi told Eurovision fansite Wiwibloggs. ""To be honest, the last eleven years."" Starykova is a backing vocalist for the band, affectionately known as ""bird girl"" as she handles the song's high notes. She previously competed in the Ukrainian version of the TV talent show The Voice, reaching the grand final, where she performed a cover of Duncan Lawrence's Eurovision winner, Arcade. Born in Donetsk, she spent her childhood in Myrnograd, living through fierce battles between Russian-supported separatists and Ukrainian government forces in the region. ""When it all started, I was just in shock,"" she later told local news outlet The Eastern Variant, recalling the heavy shelling that hit Myrnograd in 2015. ""The whole sky lit up and we started running to hide in the corridor,"" she said. ""That was the first time I felt it all."" The family later moved to Kyiv, where Starykova studied at the renowned Glière Music College - but she always intended to move back to her hometown. In a TV interview, she said it was important to go ahead with her Eurovision performance as a display of resilience. ""Despite what happened to me, I want to portray our song in a good way,"" she said. ""And just to convey our main message, that everything will be fine. ""Despite our troubles, we will survive. I'm holding on for us."""
Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2jjg10xlo,"Actress Alicia Vikander is set to make her UK theatre debut in a new production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, producers have confirmed. It will mark the Oscar winner's first stage role of any kind for 17 years, following a successful run of film and TV performances. The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday. Vikander told BBC News she was ""thrilled"" to be returning to theatre, but added it was a ""daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult"". The play has been adapted and directed by Simon Stone, and will also star The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln. Speaking from her home in north London, Vikander recalled the influence the theatre had on her when she was younger. ""I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,"" she recalled. ""Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden. ""So I think that's what I always saw in front of me. And then, life happened, and throughout the years [theatre] has always been something I've been waiting for and thinking 'it will happen'."" Vikander has certainly been busy in the meantime. The 36-year-old has starred in Tomb Raider, Ex Machina and Testament of Youth, and won a best supporting actress Oscar for her performance opposite Eddie Redmayne in 2015's The Danish Girl. Vikander will play lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper. Ellida is married to a Norwegian doctor, but when a sailor she used to be engaged to suddenly returns, she is forced to choose between her current and former lover. The play marks the introduction of the character Hilde Wangel, one of the doctor's daughters from a previous marriage. Hilde goes on to appear in one of Ibsen's later plays, The Master Builder, a new adaptation of which is coincidentally also currently in the West End, starring Ewan McGregor. An adaptation of another Ibsen play, Enemy of the People, opened in London last year starring Doctor Who actor Matt Smith. Director Stone has previously helmed films such as The Dig and The Daughter, while his extensive theatre credits include productions of Yerma, Phaedra, Medea and Angels in America. ""He once again is going to take a classic and reinvent it and make it be something that is relatable to our modern audience today,"" Vikander said. ""And when I was told he was doing Ibsen and The Lady from the Sea, I guess that going back to my Scandinavian and Swedish heritage, it kind of felt like a perfect match."" Vikander said she felt the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today. ""I have discussions with my friends, I just passed 35, I'm getting close to my 40s soon and I have my kids, but I still feel extremely young. Really young. Sometimes I'm like, 'I'm 25 still!' ""But then I also realise I'm entering this very new chapter which is really exciting, but I think if you are in a place where you feel like you haven't fulfilled certain dreams or tried things, you're still wondering where these choices or action would have led you, then I think it's extremely human thing. ""Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother. ""So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories."" She aded: ""It's incredible that the big universal questions are something we're still battling in the same way."" Vikander said she was ""super excited and wonderfully nervous"" to begin the workshopping process with Stone in the coming weeks, out of which he will begin to produce the final script. As the show is still being developed, it has not yet been confirmed what the setting will be for this production. Another UK adaptation of The Lady from the Sea performed in 2017 at the Donmar Theatre moved the story to the Caribbean in the 1950s. The new adaptation is billed as her UK stage debut, but Vikander notes it's actually her first theatre of any kind since she was 19. ""I did theatre for my teens for a lot of years, like a child actor, and then the last thing I did was when I was a dancer for the Stockholm Opera House,"" she explained. ""I grew up watching my mother doing theatre, and I 'd always watch from afar, and I can't wait to try and do it myself. ""It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited."""
Vardy must pay £1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,Vardy must pay £1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7939wwxd0jo,"Rebekah Vardy must pay more than £1.4m of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their libel battle, a judge has said. Mrs Rooney ran up a legal bill totalling more than £1.8m while successfully defending herself against Mrs Vardy's High Court claim in 2022. After Mrs Vardy lost the case, court documents showed she had been ordered to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's costs. Earlier on Tuesday, a specialist costs court was told that Mrs Vardy had agreed to pay £1.19m to Mrs Rooney, who was also asking for a further £315,000 in ""assessment costs"". Costs judge Mark Whalan then said it was ""reasonable and proportionate"" for Mrs Vardy to pay her an additional £212,266. This took the total to just over £1.4m, including interest. He said he was ""generally happy"" that the outcome represented a ""commercially satisfactory conclusion for both sides"", but noted there had been ""extraordinary expenditure of costs"" by the parties. ""I do mean it when I say that I hope that this is the end of a long and unhappy road."" Mrs Rooney is the wife of ex-England footballer Wayne Rooney, while Mrs Vardy is married to his former team-mate Jamie Vardy. Both women are now celebrities and TV personalities in their own right. Neither attended the remote hearing, with Judge Whalan declaring they ""can both part to put this matter behind them"". Mrs Vardy's barrister, Juliet Wells, had argued that Mrs Rooney was claiming ""grossly disproportionate"" costs, recommending they were capped at ""no more than £100,000"". In written submissions, Ms Wells said Mrs Rooney's original £1.8m legal bill was ""substandard"" and included costs ""of briefing the press"" and others to which she had ""no entitlement"". But lawyers for Mrs Rooney said in their written submissions that Mrs Vardy was ""the author of her own misfortune"" and that she should ""reflect upon her approach""."
Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde21wnlrpjo,"Singer Rihanna has confirmed she is expecting her third baby while attending fashion's biggest night of the year, the Met Gala in New York. The 37-year-old cradled her bump and smiled for the cameras while appearing on the red carpet, which was navy with daffodils. Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, and her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, already have two sons. A$AP Rocky, also known as Rakim Mayers, thanked reporters who offered their congratulations on the red carpet. ""It is time to just show the people what we were cooking up,"" he said. Rihanna was the last to arrive at the benefit event for New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which marks the opening of its Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit. Each year celebrities wear extravagant outfits in line with the event's theme. This year's concept was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,"" the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the couple's pregnancy news on the red carpet. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" the rapper said. ""I'm glad everybody's happy for us because we're definitely happy"", he added. The couple's first son RZA was born in May 2022 and their second son, Riot, was born in August 2023. The pop star and businesswoman is known for her high-profile pregnancy announcements. She debuted the pregnancy of her first child with a photoshoot with her partner in Harlem, New York City in 2022. When she performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 she revealed she was expecting their second child. She's not the first star to reveal their baby bump at the Met Gala - the former tennis player, Serena Williams and model Karlie Kloss both publicly revealed their pregnancies at the 2023 event."
Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01kx3yrmvo,"Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries. Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying ""a very fast death"". In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a ""calm and steady approach"" to talks in a bid to ""ease pressure on UK businesses"". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being ""jobless"" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a ""knock-out blow"". The UK film sector is worth £1.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October. Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed. White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit. ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said. Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is ""dominated"" by inward investment from US studios and that this ""brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK"". Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned ""against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe"" when the report came out. ""President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,"" she said. Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios. She urged ministers to ""urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way"". Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must ""get a grip"" to secure a trade deal with the US and ""protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success"". It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: ""The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means. ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot? ""Hollywood… has been in decline for some time,"" he said. ""A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia."" He added: ""One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world."" Bell concurred that ""the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places"" and lower costs. ""People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed."" She added: ""The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood."" According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20 percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (£248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive. A government spokesperson said on Monday: ""The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world. ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon. ""Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers."" Dozens of Hollywood blockbusters in recent years have actually seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, including:"
12 of the best films to watch this May,Thunderbolts* to Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning: 12 of the best films to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250423-12-of-the-best-films-to-watch-in-may,"The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream. Cobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance – and as Mr Miyagi once explained, ""Balance is key"". ""Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film – even though they're separate ecosystems – it all made sense for me,"" Macchio said in Variety. ""Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?"" Released on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally Danny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family. ""We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,"" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. ""They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me."" Released on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally The co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells ""the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of"". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed – and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is ""a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive"", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com. Released on 16 May on Apple+ internationally There were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. ""Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,"" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. ""Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed."" Well… maybe. Released on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally In 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri – and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a ""shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre"". Fans of the first film will ""cherish this divinely twisted thriller"". Released on 1 May on Prime Video internationally Tim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian ""breaks up"" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is ""feverishly and hilariously demented"", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. ""Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year."" Released on 9 May in the US Admittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures – so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial. Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally Nicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is ""a gloriously demented B-movie thriller"", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks ""the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic"". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. ""Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,"" says Brooks, ""The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe."" Released on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia Jane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen herself? ""The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,"" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots. Released on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK The original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 – and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. ""You gotta see the movie,"" he told Empire magazine. ""It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience."" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word ""Final"" is in there for a reason. ""It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,"" he says. ""I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate."" Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally It seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles – and enviable kitchens – of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far? Released on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW ""After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,"" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, ""a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top."" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. ""It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,"" says Marric. ""It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.""

10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,The Four Seasons to And Just Like That…: 10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-10-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-may,"From Tina Fey's new relationship comedy to an action drama from the creator of Lost, and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker and co in the third season of the Sex and the City sequel. Tine Fey stars in and co-created this comedy about three couples, long-time friends with enough disposable income to vacation together four times a year through different seasons. As in the 1981 film it is based on, everyone is rattled when one pair heads for divorce. Fey and Will Forte play one of the couples. Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani are another, a same-sex twist that is the most obvious update from '81. And Steve Carell plays a man who is leaving his wife (Kerri Kenney-Silver) for a younger woman (Erika Henningsen), a timeless part of the plot. Fey has called the show ""a love letter to long-term relationships, both platonic and romantic"", adding, ""I hope audiences feel like they are inside a big sweater with us, and also having a dinner party with us."" So if you like dinner parties in chunky sweaters, this is the show for you. The Four Seasons premieres 1 May on Netflix internationally Star Natasha Lyonne and creator Rian Johnson (Knives Out) have brought their popular homage to the classic Peter Falk series Columbo, and 1970s television in general, back for a second season. Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who has an incredible knack for running across murders, scoping out who's telling the truth and who's lying, and solving the case by the end of the episode. Now on the run from a different crime boss than in the first season, Charlie is still on the road, travelling to a different place in every episode, each featuring a slew of guest stars. This time they include Cynthia Erivo, Awkwafina, Giancarlo Esposito, Kumail Nanjiani, John Mulaney, Katie Holmes and about two dozen others, as Charlie stumbles across trouble at a funeral home, a baseball game and an alligator farm. Running through it all are Lyonne's trademark sardonic delivery and the series's fast-paced retro feel. Poker Face premieres 8 May on Peacock in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK Judy Blume's 1975 YA novel about first love is reimagined with an update in this series set in Los Angeles in 2018, with a cast largely composed of black actors. High school students Keisha (Lovie Simone), a track star, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), a basketball player, are childhood friends who lost touch. When they meet again at a party and fall in love, they face all the intense feelings and decisions that brings. Over the years, Blume's novel has been banned in several US states for the direct way its characters confront the question of when to have their first sexual experience (Blume's honesty is exactly what many fans like about her) and the issue needed a new lens for the 21st Century. But the series' showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, has also leant into the timeless theme of romance, and the Los Angeles setting feeds into it. ""What better metaphor for this love story than what LA represents,"" she has said. ""You're looking for a place to follow your dreams, and love is a part of that."" Forever premieres 8 May on Netflix internationally Retro television is having a moment with Poker Face and this action drama set in 1972 in the Southwest US. JJ Abrams is an executive producer and, along with LaToya Morgan, wrote the first two episodes of the series, which stars Josh Holloway, still best known as Sawyer from Abrams's Lost, as a swaggering driver for a crime syndicate. Rachel Hilson plays the first black female FBI agent, who chases him down, with Keith David as the syndicate's boss. In addition to the cat-and-mouse crime story and possibly wavering loyalties, Duster has knife fights, cars flipping over and dust all around. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter that the series came about because ""I had this image of a phone booth in the middle of the desert and a car driving up, and a guy getting on the phone to find out where he was meant to go next"". That turned into a show that he calls ""a crazy story"" with humour, absurdity and lots of plot turns. Duster premieres 15 May on Max in the US Television is full of sci-fi series, but this one has a comic twist and Alexander Skarsgård, as a robot who manages to hack its own system and go rogue. ""I am a security unit,"" it announces in its cheery voiceover. ""I was built to protect and obey humans. And humans are idiots."" Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy) created the show, based on Martha Wells' series of books, The Murderbot Diaries, and have given it a Blade Runner-meets-Black Mirror style. Although the title robot calls itself Murderbot, it doesn't really want to kill anyone. It prefers sitting around bingeing its favourite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a series-within-the-series with John Cho and Jack McBrayer playing the leads. When it lands on a new planet, its social awkwardness creates a very human problem, which makes it, Skarsgård told Empire magazine, ""more relatable than most characters I've ever played"". Of course, he has played Tarzan and a vampire, so relatable is a relative thing. Murderbot premieres 16 May on Apple TV+ internationally Nicole Kidman and her collection of improbable wigs – see The Undoing or The Perfect Couple – are now television mainstays. In season two of this series based on a Liane Moriarty novel, she returns as psychedelic-dispensing wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko, still Russian-accented but now with a pin-straight bob instead of a waist-length mop of waves. She has also relocated her week-long retreat from sunny California to the snowy Austrian Alps, where another crop of troubled, privileged characters turn up – like The White Lotus but with a cult-like, possibly charlatan therapist. As Kidman told Vanity Fair about Masha, ""She morphs. She adapts."" New characters are played by another starry cast, including Henry Golding, Christine Baranski, Mark Strong, Lena Olin and Murray Bartlett. Let the wig-games begin. Vulture has even ranked them. Nine Perfect Strangers premieres 21 May on Hulu in the US and 22 May on Amazon Prime Video in the UK Julianne Moore and Meghann Fahy star in this dark comedy about power, class and control, set over one weekend on a wealthy resort island. Moore plays Michaela, a philanthropist and animal activist who is also iron-fisted in her control of island society. Her personal assistant, Simone (Milly Alcock, who played the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragons), is so in thrall to her that Simone's sister, Devon, (Fahy) comes to the island to stage an intervention. Kevin Bacon plays Michaela's billionaire husband, with Glenn Howerton and Bill Camp among the supporting cast. The series was created by Molly Smith Metzler, who also created the hit Netflix series Maid. She based Sirens on her 2011 play Elemeno Pea, and has said that the show has ""a Greek mythology vibe"", presumably because Michaela sends out such a siren's call to Simone. But details are scarce, so for all we know this siren, as in mythology, could turn out to be half bird. Fully human or not, Moore is always worth watching. Sirens premieres 22 May on Netflix internationally Matthew Goode stars in this crime thriller, the latest show from Scott Frank, the creator of terrific series including The Queen's Gambit and Monsieur Spade. The hero, Carl Morck (Goode), is an abrasive detective in Edinburgh whose partner has been paralyzed on the job, sending him into a tailspin and landing him a low-profile role as head of a new cold-case unit called Department Q. Headquartered in a basement, his unit of misfits is meant to be no more than a publicity move for the police – but as in Slow Horses, the band of outcasts is smarter than their prized colleagues. Frank based the show on a series of Danish novels and changed the setting to Edinburgh, where it was shot. Meanwhile, Morck has been made into an Englishman, a fish out of water whose ex-wife is Scottish, which accounts for his very bad attitude toward all Scots. The top-flight cast includes Kelly Macdonald and Shirley Henderson. Dept Q premieres 29 May on Netflix internationally An unlikely family tangle is beneath the plot of this thriller with Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks as estranged sisters who have very different lives. Biel plays Chloe, a polished media executive who lives in upscale comfort with her lawyer husband (Corey Stoll) and teenage son. Banks plays Nicky, a recovering addict who is struggling financially. When someone in the family is murdered, the death and their old sibling rivalry converge, as the sisters come together to find the truth of what happened. Lorraine Toussaint, Matthew Modine and Gloria Reuben are also in the cast. Olivia Milch, who co-created the show with Regina Corrado (based on a 2019 novel by Alafair Burke) told Glamour that the question of which sister is better ""changes moment to moment"", which sounds just right for a thriller. The Better Sister premieres 29 May on Prime Video internationally As she ambles into her next chapter in life, nearly 30 years after Sex and the City premiered, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) still has great shoes, as seen in the trailer for the third season of this sequel series. The new season puts her where the last one ended, in a new apartment and trying a long-distance relationship with Aiden (John Corbett). But Carrie is now writing a novel, instead of the personal column she used to write. As always, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) have their own issues. Sarita Choudhury and Nicole Ari Parker return as recently-acquired core friends Seema and Lisa, while Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone appear as brand new characters. The show has inspired long-loyal, opinionated fans, who will want to know whether or not two old favourites are missing: Che Diaz (Sarah Ramirez), Miranda's former partner who was a love-them or hate-them character, and Kim Cattrall, whose phoned-in cameo as Samantha last season – really, she was shown in a car on the phone for a minute – was a fizzle.

The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,'It was the cleverest escape in the prison's 30 years': The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240607-it-was-the-cleverest-escape-in-the-prisons-30-years-the-men-who-broke-out-of-alcatraz-with-a-spoon,"On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape – from what was the US's most secure prison – continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime. In May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made ""the most feared journey in the criminal world"" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed ""the Rock"", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped. Alcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". ""Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,"" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it. Four years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night. When the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. ""A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,"" he said. ""Built over the rambling passages of an old fort… the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up."" With Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-mâché grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood. But while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-mâché versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place. More like this: • How D-Day began with a death-defying mission • The US couple who survived the Alaskan wilderness • Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death' Finally, on the night of 11 June 1962, they were ready to put their ingenious plan into motion. Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it – carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower – shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered. The island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. ""When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,"" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. ""I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was."" The prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again. Although the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964."" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,"" he said. ""Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?"" Alcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: ""the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners"". Over the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves – unable to face the unrelenting conditions – and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment. As for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service. But speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them. In 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read ""I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!"" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not. The case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.

The Cold War spy mystery of the vanishing frogman,'He swam out to the Russian vessel and was never seen alive again': The Cold War spy mystery of the 'vanishing frogman',https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250501-the-cold-war-spy-mystery-of-buster-crabb,"In 1956, Royal Navy Commander ""Buster"" Crabb disappeared in murky circumstances during a visit to the UK by Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan read the newly declassified files that detailed Crabb's unofficial secret mission – and how the government tried to cover it up. It was on 9 May 1956, 68 years ago this week, that UK Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden finally succumbed to press pressure and international embarrassment, and ordered an enquiry into the mysterious disappearance of Royal Navy diver Commander Lionel ""Buster"" Crabb. The decorated frogman had vanished during a goodwill visit to the UK by the Soviet leadership at the height of Cold War tensions. When word leaked that Crabb had gone missing, The Admiralty, the government department responsible for the Navy, issued a vague statement that the diver had been testing underwater equipment at Stokes Bay on the Hampshire coast and was presumed drowned. But the story fell apart when the visiting Russians accused their hosts of espionage. The Soviets claimed that they had seen a frogman near the Ordzhonikidze – the ship that had brought the Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev to the UK – while it was docked in Portsmouth Harbour. Despite questions being asked repeatedly in Parliament, Eden refused to say more, claiming: ""It would not be in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which Commander Crabb is presumed to have met his death."" The government's stonewalling merely heightened suspicions that Crabb had been on a covert spy mission. Fourteen months after Crabb vanished, a headless, handless body in a diving suit was found by fishermen in Chichester Harbour on the south coast of England. Its lack of fingerprints and teeth made the mutilated body difficult to identify, but a later inquest ruled that it was Crabb. The whole episode publicly embarrassed Eden and wrecked his attempts to develop a more friendly relationship with a post-Stalin Soviet Union. When he disappeared in 1956, Crabb was well known for his daring underwater exploits. Nicknamed ""Buster"", after the US Olympic swimmer and actor Buster Crabbe, who had risen to fame in the 1930s, he was an expert in underwater bomb disposal. His bravery during World War Two had earned him the George Medal for removing Italian limpet mines from British warships at Malta, and an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his mine clearance work at Livorno in Italy. His wartime amphibious adventures would later be fictionalised in a 1958 film, The Silent Enemy, with Crabb being played by Laurence Harvey. And even after he was officially demobbed in 1947, he continued diving for the military in various capacities, including investigating sunken submarines. For decades following the frogman's disappearance, the UK government staunchly maintained its silence on the incident. It would only be from 2006 onwards, when due to Freedom of Information requests by the BBC, and classified documents being made public under the 50-year rule, that the murky circumstances of Crabb's ill-fated final dive began to emerge. The declassified files showed that, from the start, the UK's security services were keen to use the opportunity of Khruschev's visit to gather intelligence on their Cold War opponents. They suggested hiding microphones in Claridge's hotel, which the Soviet leadership intended to use as their headquarters during their stay. But the prime minister expressly ruled out the idea and made ""clear that adventures of a similar nature were forbidden"". Despite this, MI6 recruited Crabb to undertake an ""unofficial enterprise"" to investigate the Russian ship Ordzhonikidze. The exact nature of his mission is still unclear, but the ex-MI5 officer Peter Wright suggested in his book Spycatcher (1987) that it was to examine and photograph the ship's advanced propeller design. Two days before the mission, Crabb and another MI6 agent, who went by the name Bernard Smith, checked into the Sally Port hotel in Portsmouth. On the evening of 17 April 1956, Crabb met with a military colleague in a local pub. This colleague, whose name was deleted from the file, was a Royal Navy lieutenant commander who agreed to help Crabb get into Portsmouth Harbour for his final dive. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan got the chance to examine the previously classified sworn statement by ""the last man to see Crabb alive"". ""He says he was approached by the commander a couple of days before his final dive and asked 'if I would be prepared to assist him, entirely unofficially and in a strictly private capacity, in connection with a dive he was taking a day or two later'. He goes on to say under no account was this man to contact any responsible naval authority,"" said Buchanan. More like this: • The greatest sailing rescue ever made • A death-defying D-Day mission in a wooden glider • The US's most damaging double agent Just before 07:00 on 19 April, the unnamed lieutenant commander went with Crabb to Portsmouth Harbour, and helped him dress and check his equipment. Crabb then swam out to the Russian vessel, and was never seen alive again. The Royal Navy made no attempt to look for the missing frogman for fear of alerting the Ordzhonikidze's crew. ""The documents further reveal that no search and rescue efforts were made for Crabb as it was not a bonafide operation,"" said Buchanan. ""And they detailed the extensive efforts made by [the Admiralty] to ensure they weren't implicated in a botched mission they knew nothing about."" The intelligence services surmised that Crabb must have either been captured by the Soviets, been destroyed by Russian ""countermeasures"", or suffered a ""natural mishap"". Smith, the MI6 agent, removed Crabb's belongings and checked out of the Sally Port hotel. A few days later, the police removed the pages with their details from the Sally Port's register, which only served to fuel suspicions of a covert mission. Under pressure from MI6 and the government, the Admiralty hastily concocted the spurious story that Crabb had gone missing during a test in Stokes Bay. Records of meetings show the panic at the highest levels of government. Officials feared that if a body was found, the Soviets could use Crabb's death for propaganda purposes. National Archives' Howard Davis told the BBC in 2006 that the file ""makes it perfectly clear that this wasn't an Admiralty operation; they had nothing to do with it and we see them trying to construct a story that they can plausibly tell to face the inevitable questions from the press"". But despite the release of some of the government's classified documents, exactly what happened to the diver that day in 1956 is still unknown. In 1990, Joseph Zwerkin, a former Soviet naval intelligence agent, claimed that a Soviet sniper on the Ordzhonikidze's deck had spotted the diver in the water and shot him. In 2007, a 74-year-old former Russian frogman, Eduard Koltsov, claimed that he slashed Crabb's throat in an underwater fight after catching him attaching a mine to Ordzhonikidze. It has also been suggested that as Crabb was an associate of Sir Anthony Blunt, who was unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1979, he could even have defected. Nicholas Elliott, a former senior MI6 agent who was rumoured to be involved in Crabb's final dive, believed that the 47-year-old diver, who was known for his fondness for whiskey and cigarettes, had succumbed to oxygen poisoning or a heart attack as a result of his exertions while underwater. It may be some time before more details of Crabb's fate come to light. While some papers concerning the affair have been released into the public domain, others have had their classified status extended by the government and are not scheduled for release until 2057. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

"The long tradition of black dandyism, this year's Met Gala theme",'Clothes can contain a lot of emotion': How black men have used flamboyant fashion to express pride and resistance,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250502-how-black-men-have-used-bold-fashion-as-resistance,"This year's Costume Institute spring exhibition and Met Gala are honouring black ""dandy"" style, and the tradition of bold tailoring worn by black men that has made a statement. Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history. The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), ""arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed"". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities – in a context where the very concept of ""blackness"" was created by non-black oppressors. Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme ""Tailored for you"" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James. The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The ""superfine"" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to ""a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'"" – a reminder that how you dress can contain ""a lot of emotion"". Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. ""Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,"" Miller tells the BBC. ""It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised."" Dandyism was already laying its foundations. In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters – in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman. However, in the case of Julius Soubise – manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury – the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be. While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing – once again – boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman – complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles – in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with ""a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]"" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his ""master"" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England. Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of. In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them. The suit, explains Miller, is ""a historical throughline"" in the exhibition, which includes everything ""from livery garments… to tailcoats and different versions of it… to even track suiting"". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom. More like this: • Seven of the best Met Gala looks over the decades • Coachella looks from Lady Gaga to Sabrina Carpenter •The indigenous American supermodel bringing change When rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched ""Hammer pants"". Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as ""a dandy among dandies"", André Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. ""He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,"" writes Wintour. ""For André, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once."" For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Iké Udé, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. ""Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,"" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Udé, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. ""He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,"" explains Miller. ""It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit."" This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline ""designed by an immigrant"". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. ""He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,"" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, ""that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that"". Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. ""Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture."" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. ""It's very much related to a jazz riff,"" Miller adds. ""Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new…"" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025. The accompanying book by Monica L Miller is published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and distributed by Yale University Press. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The true story of the first-ever 'rock star' chef,The 'first celebrity chef': How 19th-Century cook Antonin Carême made extraordinary food fit for kings,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-how-19th-century-bad-boy-antonin-careme-made-food-rock-n-roll,"A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called ""King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"" – shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks. It's described as ""the story of the first celebrity chef"". The French language series Carême is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Carême, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today – giving birth to the very idea of the ""celebrity"" chef. Indeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Carême, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, ""he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,"" he tells the BBC. And Voisin's portrayal of Carême feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen – a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. The series is inspired by a biography of Carême and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a ""bookish innocent"" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Carême aged 25: ""He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater."" Kelly also describes Carême as ""ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic"" as a person – although the Carême on screen risks much for those he loves. Indeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Carême as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as ""the charm of fiction in the show"". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, ""He [Carême] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life… and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing."" What is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Carême's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University. ""He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,"" Freedman tells the BBC. ""He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Carême."" While some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience. Bourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid ""the usual period drama style"" in this story. ""I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Carême,"" he says. ""And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life."" Voisin says their idea of the chef was that he had ""a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me"". ""I love looking to the historical story of Carême, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society."" The historical Carême's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as ""the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"". He's often credited as a founder of French gastronomy and of Grande Cuisine (classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century). However, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman Guillaume Tirel, known as ""Taillevent"", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several restaurants still bear his name. Carême's status is, he says, ""a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs. ""So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant."" The young Carême's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Carême: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that the ""Reign of Terror"" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable pâtissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-Périgord, known as Talleyrand. Even if the real Carême didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now. ""We know that Carême worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Carême brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time."" Politics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, ""Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so"". The visuals directly link the food Carême cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Carême licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri. ""The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,"" Voisin says. ""Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection."" The link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Carême's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital ""had become the City of Light – and the capital of food"". The talk around the young Carême, he says, would have been ""of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris"". Carême's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says. ""I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,"" he tells the BBC. A French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. ""One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit."" The era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Carême's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from ""economic disaster"". ""Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,"" she says. ""That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Carême wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty."" A later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) – who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London – ""is really Carême's heir,"" Cooke says. ""Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,"" she explains. ""He was able to achieve Carême's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Carême could not, because Carême was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too."" (Carême did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.) The emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Carême Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour. In another nod to modernity, the young Carême in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's ""Showstopper"" category might trace its ancestry back to Carême's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France. But now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly ""celebrity"" chef ""My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adrià, who was at El Bulli, or René Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented."" There is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Carême – and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention. ""Although Carême's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,"" he says. ""I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together – food, love and politics."" Carême premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Thunderbolts* is 'the greatest Marvel in years' ★★★★☆,Thunderbolts* review: 'The greatest Marvel offering in years',https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-thunderbolts-film-review,"The latest in the superhero franchise ""is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun"", with a ""charismatic"" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber. Ever since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end. The Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called ""Infinity Saga"" – the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years. The key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods. There's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong – but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep. De Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better. One small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not. More like this: • A combat epic that 'does what film does best' • Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis' • Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' The underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts – and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes. At both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion – and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre. ★★★★☆ -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Why Sinners has become a box-office sensation,'It doesn't stick to the rules': The reason Sinners has become a true box-office sensation,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-the-reason-sinners-has-become-a-true-box-office-sensation,"After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises. In less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a ""rule-defying"" proposition that ""continues to defy all the odds"", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (£34m) against its opening $48m (£36m). ""Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,"" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be ""the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013"". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (£120m), against a $90m (£67m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner – just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that ""profitability remains a question mark"". Perhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film – but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves – which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: ""Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?"" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread. This unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material – or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station – but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as ""something to hide behind"". He wanted to make the most personal film he could – a ""love letter"" to a late uncle from Mississippi – and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions. More like this: • 10 of the best films of 2025 so far • The best films to watch in April • Warfare review: it 'does what film does best' In some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with ""must-see"" and ""must-talk-about"" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: ""I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo."" That could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g3ldd20vo,"The BBC has announced plans to make a Call the Midwife film as well as a prequel TV series set during the Second World War. It comes as filming begins for the 15th series of the BBC One drama, which follows a group of nurse midwives working in London's East End from the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will ""delve into the deeper past"", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The new, separate film and prequel projects will be written, created and produced by Thomas and executive producers Dame Pippa Harris and Ann Tricklebank, who will also oversee the production of series 16 of the programme together. The prequel series will feature ""some familiar (if much younger) faces"", Thomas said. She said that while she has ""never run out of stories for our midwives"", she had found herself ""yearning to delve into the deeper past"" than the years 1957 to 1971 which have been covered by the show. ""The Blitz years in the East End were extraordinary - filled with loss, togetherness, courage and joy,"" she said. Meanwhile, the film will see the ""much-loved"" regular characters ""take a short break from Poplar and test themselves in an unfamiliar landscape"", Ms Thomas said. The location of the film remains ""top secret"", she added - but said it would look ""absolutely fantastic"" on the big screen. The first series of the show was originally inspired by the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, who worked as a midwife and nurse in the community in Poplar. Dame Pippa said the prequel series and film project were being made partly for a ""new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face."" The 15th series will begin with a two-part Christmas special which will see characters travelling to Hong Kong on a mercy mission."

27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xvd10xv5o,"Monday night marked one of the world's biggest nights of fashion, as stars served up their most iconic looks for the annual Met Gala in New York City. The theme for this year's event was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"", the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. It was inspired by a newly unveiled exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume institute featuring the ""black dandy"", which Vogue says ""examines the importance of clothing and style to the formation of black identities in the Atlantic diaspora"". A-list celebrities including Zendaya, Demi Moore and Diana Ross brought their own interpretation to the theme, stunning in tailored suits and dramatic gowns. Here is a look at some of the highlights: Actress Zendaya, known for her dazzling red carpet style, opted for a wide-brimmed hat and tailored Louis Vuitton cream suit at this year's Met Gala. But there was one slight pop of colour: her manicured red nails. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny wore a brown Prada suit, which he said he worked on with the Italian fashion house for a few months before the event. He also stayed on theme by accessorising with embellished gloves, a brooch and a hat that paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage. ""We did something special,"" he said of his look. ""I feel good, and I hope people think I'm looking good."" US reality TV star Kim Kardashian wore an all-black ensemble by LA-based brand Chrome Hearts - a fitted leather top and skirt that she offset with diamond necklaces and two strings of pearls. She is, of course, no stranger to the Met Gala - having made headlines with a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in 2022, and a wet-look Thierry Mugler dress in 2019. Black British designer Grace Wales Bonner dressed British Formula One star Sir Lewis Hamilton for the night. Sir Lewis was a co-chair of this year's event. The pair have worked together in the past with Wales Bonner dressing Hamilton for the 2023 British Fashion Awards. Singer Chappell Roan brought a rare pop of colour to the Met's blue carpet, in a patchwork hot pink ensemble sourced from eBay. The singer worked with Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell on her outfit, while make-up artist Pat McGrath was behind her disco-inspired look. Demi Moore gave us another round of method dressing. The American actress's recent press tour for The Substance recalled the body horror themes of the film, while her awards campaign for the role of Elisabeth Sparkle saw her dressing for the glam statuettes. Moore understood the assignment for the Met Gala, coming as a literal men's tie in a sculptural black and white striped sequin gown from Thom Browne. Rihanna, typically one of the most stylish attendees at the Gala, returned to the Met steps this year in Marc Jacobs, debuting her pregnancy with co-chair of the evening A$AP Rocky. Legendary singer Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble, complete with feathers and a long train that required at least two assistants. On the carpet, Ross said her son persuaded her to attend this year's event. The last time she attended the Met Gala is 2003. She added she had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered on her dress train. Actress Sydney Sweeney wore a custom Miu Miu gown - her third time wearing the designer at the Met Gala. This time, her dress was complete with beaded fringe shoulders and gold hardware detailing on the neck. Speaking about her look, Sweeney said it paid homage to actress and painter Kim Novak. Sweeney is set to portray Novak in the upcoming film Scandalous. A custom-made Chanel look was Dua Lipa's choice this year. The chiffon dress, sequin tweed jacket and organza cape - all adorned with pearls, feathers and crystals - took some 2,000 hours to make. Sabrina Carpenter wore a burgundy Louis Vuitton bodysuit that featured all the tailoring of a regular suit. The singer said she worked with recording artist Pharrell Williams - also the men's creative director of Louis Vuitton - on the bottomless look. ""You're quite short, so no pants for you,"" Carpenter recalled Williams telling her. Irish actor Barry Keoghan wore a custom-made Valentino fit, with florals embroidered on the cuffs and a silk red scarf wrapped around the waist. New Zealand singer Lorde made a rare appearance at the Met Gala this year (she has not attended since 2021). She wore a metallic silver floor-length skirt set, and a matching bandeau and blazer designed by Thom Browne. Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Simone Biles brought a pop of colour to the Met Gala carpet with a striking blue minidress that featured a collared neckline, a long train and jewelled appliques. The dress was designed by Harbison Studio. Singer Coco Jones opted for a look designed by Indian brand Manish Malhotra. She wore a tailored cream and white look that featured ornate embroidery and a dramatic long-sleeve coat. Jones also wore a large statement necklace and Jimmy Choo heels. Actor and playwright Colman Domingo could have inspired this year's Met Gala theme, as he's been carrying the baton for well-dressed men on the red carpet for several years now. He donned a royal blue Valentino cloak that paid homage to Andre Leon Talley, former editor-at-large on Vogue whom Anna Wintour called ""a dandy among dandies."" The cape later was removed to reveal a second look underneath: a tailored, patterned suit complete with a big fabric, polka-dotted flower brooch. Actress and singer Teyana Taylor, who hosted Vogue's live stream of the red carpet, arrived in custom Marc Jacobs on the arm of costume designer Ruth E. Carter. Ms Carter has worked with filmmaker Spike Lee and on the Black Panther movie franchise to create some modern pop cultural cues for the black dandy. Taylor wore a burgundy cape embroidered with ""Harlem Rose,"" a nod to her 2018 song A Rose in Harlem. Social media influencer Emma Chamberlain looked sharp and on theme with a backless tailored suit dress designed by French fashion house Courrèges. She accessorised the look with a spiky beach blonde pixie cut and stylish eyeglasses. Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, known for her on-theme style, wore a Givenchy ensemble featuring a bedazzled bodice and an extra-long black train with matching leather boots and nails. Recording artist Doja Cat wore a custom Marc Jacobs look that featured giant shoulder pads and a leopard-print bustier panel. ""I just wanted to feel like a little gangsta,"" she said. ""I feel like he brought that with the strong shape of the shoulders, and all of the exaggerated shapes,"" Doja Cat said of Jacobs. Actress Tracee Ellis Ross, the daughter of Diana Ross, was one of the few people who wore pink at this year's Met Gala. She donned a custom Marc Jacobs suit that was complete with a giant, hot pink bow at the back, a matching top hat and some unique bling. In one of the more memorable looks of the evening, Andre 3000 showed up to the Met Gala carpet with a black and white piano strapped to his back and a trash bag as a purse. The stylish OutKast rapper designed the look himself in collaboration with Burberry. Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o wore a stunning powder blue Chanel suit, with a matching hat and transparent cape. She accessorised the look with bedazzled, black rhinestone eyebrows. Rapper Cardi B debuted a new hairstyle (and eye colour) in a green Burberry pantsuit, complete with matching nails and eye shadow. Doechii took brand representation to new levels, stamping the famous Louis Vuitton logo on her face to go along with the motif of her suit. The American rapper is often seen wearing looks from the French fashion house. This outfit combined the designer's two famous patterns - the LV monogram pattern on the waistcoat and jacket, as well as the damier checkerboard on the shorts. When asked about her outfit on the carpet, Janelle Monáe responded simply - ""free"" - followed by an expletive. ""And when I'm in my suit, that is exactly how I feel,"" she said. She wore a Thom Brown suit, with whom she's attended the Met Gala as a guest for the last several years. The look is styled by the Academy Award-winning costume designer for Wicked, Paul Tazewell. Pop legend Madonna accessorised her cream-colored tuxedo with a cigar, creating an interplay between soft feminine materials and a distinct masculine energy. It's a dynamic that the superstar has played with throughout her career."
Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g03g71qno,"The home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant Khrystyna Starykova has been destroyed by Russian shelling in the city of Myrnograd. The 19-year-old is currently in Switzerland rehearsing for her performance with the band Ziferblat, but posted photos of her damaged apartment block in the Sviltly neighbourhood. ""Home. And I dreamed so much of returning home,"" she captioned the post, which showed the building shrouded in smoke, with its windows blown out and several balconies collapsed. ""Fortunately, all my relatives and friends are alive and well,"" she said, and vowed to perform at Eurovision next week ""for the sake of our country"". ""[I want] to show what a strong people we are."" In an interview with Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne, Starykova said she had almost anticipated the destruction of her home. ""Four months ago, my grandmother lost her home - it was just such a big hole,"" she said. ""Then my aunt lost the roof over her head. ""I understood that maybe I could be the next one and, unfortunately, it happened. It's very terrible news. I had really hoped to go back."" The singer's home is less than five miles from the frontline, near the industrial city of Pokrovsk, a key battleground on Ukraine's eastern front. In a new Instagram post on Tuesday morning, she shared further footage of Myrnograd's bomb-damaged streets. ""I always went home from vocal lessons this way,"" she wrote in the caption. ""It was my favourite way home."" Ziferblat will represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest with Bird of Pray, a song telling the story of Ukrainians who have been separated from their loved ones by the war with Russia. ""It's about our problems we go through, the tragedy for the last three years,"" singer Valentyn Leshchynskyi told Eurovision fansite Wiwibloggs. ""To be honest, the last eleven years."" Starykova is a backing vocalist for the band, affectionately known as ""bird girl"" as she handles the song's high notes. She previously competed in the Ukrainian version of the TV talent show The Voice, reaching the grand final, where she performed a cover of Duncan Lawrence's Eurovision winner, Arcade. Born in Donetsk, she spent her childhood in Myrnograd, living through fierce battles between Russian-supported separatists and Ukrainian government forces in the region. ""When it all started, I was just in shock,"" she later told local news outlet The Eastern Variant, recalling the heavy shelling that hit Myrnograd in 2015. ""The whole sky lit up and we started running to hide in the corridor,"" she said. ""That was the first time I felt it all."" The family later moved to Kyiv, where Starykova studied at the renowned Glière Music College - but she always intended to move back to her hometown. In a TV interview, she said it was important to go ahead with her Eurovision performance as a display of resilience. ""Despite what happened to me, I want to portray our song in a good way,"" she said. ""And just to convey our main message, that everything will be fine. ""Despite our troubles, we will survive. I'm holding on for us."""
Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2jjg10xlo,"Actress Alicia Vikander is set to make her UK theatre debut in a new production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, producers have confirmed. It will mark the Oscar winner's first stage role of any kind for 17 years, following a successful run of film and TV performances. The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday. Vikander told BBC News she was ""thrilled"" to be returning to theatre, but added it was a ""daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult"". The play has been adapted and directed by Simon Stone, and will also star The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln. Speaking from her home in north London, Vikander recalled the influence the theatre had on her when she was younger. ""I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,"" she recalled. ""Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden. ""So I think that's what I always saw in front of me. And then, life happened, and throughout the years [theatre] has always been something I've been waiting for and thinking 'it will happen'."" Vikander has certainly been busy in the meantime. The 36-year-old has starred in Tomb Raider, Ex Machina and Testament of Youth, and won a best supporting actress Oscar for her performance opposite Eddie Redmayne in 2015's The Danish Girl. Vikander will play lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper. Ellida is married to a Norwegian doctor, but when a sailor she used to be engaged to suddenly returns, she is forced to choose between her current and former lover. The play marks the introduction of the character Hilde Wangel, one of the doctor's daughters from a previous marriage. Hilde goes on to appear in one of Ibsen's later plays, The Master Builder, a new adaptation of which is coincidentally also currently in the West End, starring Ewan McGregor. An adaptation of another Ibsen play, Enemy of the People, opened in London last year starring Doctor Who actor Matt Smith. Director Stone has previously helmed films such as The Dig and The Daughter, while his extensive theatre credits include productions of Yerma, Phaedra, Medea and Angels in America. ""He once again is going to take a classic and reinvent it and make it be something that is relatable to our modern audience today,"" Vikander said. ""And when I was told he was doing Ibsen and The Lady from the Sea, I guess that going back to my Scandinavian and Swedish heritage, it kind of felt like a perfect match."" Vikander said she felt the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today. ""I have discussions with my friends, I just passed 35, I'm getting close to my 40s soon and I have my kids, but I still feel extremely young. Really young. Sometimes I'm like, 'I'm 25 still!' ""But then I also realise I'm entering this very new chapter which is really exciting, but I think if you are in a place where you feel like you haven't fulfilled certain dreams or tried things, you're still wondering where these choices or action would have led you, then I think it's extremely human thing. ""Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother. ""So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories."" She aded: ""It's incredible that the big universal questions are something we're still battling in the same way."" Vikander said she was ""super excited and wonderfully nervous"" to begin the workshopping process with Stone in the coming weeks, out of which he will begin to produce the final script. As the show is still being developed, it has not yet been confirmed what the setting will be for this production. Another UK adaptation of The Lady from the Sea performed in 2017 at the Donmar Theatre moved the story to the Caribbean in the 1950s. The new adaptation is billed as her UK stage debut, but Vikander notes it's actually her first theatre of any kind since she was 19. ""I did theatre for my teens for a lot of years, like a child actor, and then the last thing I did was when I was a dancer for the Stockholm Opera House,"" she explained. ""I grew up watching my mother doing theatre, and I 'd always watch from afar, and I can't wait to try and do it myself. ""It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited."""
Vardy must pay £1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,Vardy must pay £1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7939wwxd0jo,"Rebekah Vardy must pay more than £1.4m of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their libel battle, a judge has said. Mrs Rooney ran up a legal bill totalling more than £1.8m while successfully defending herself against Mrs Vardy's High Court claim in 2022. After Mrs Vardy lost the case, court documents showed she had been ordered to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's costs. Earlier on Tuesday, a specialist costs court was told that Mrs Vardy had agreed to pay £1.19m to Mrs Rooney, who was also asking for a further £315,000 in ""assessment costs"". Costs judge Mark Whalan then said it was ""reasonable and proportionate"" for Mrs Vardy to pay her an additional £212,266. This took the total to just over £1.4m, including interest. He said he was ""generally happy"" that the outcome represented a ""commercially satisfactory conclusion for both sides"", but noted there had been ""extraordinary expenditure of costs"" by the parties. ""I do mean it when I say that I hope that this is the end of a long and unhappy road."" Mrs Rooney is the wife of ex-England footballer Wayne Rooney, while Mrs Vardy is married to his former team-mate Jamie Vardy. Both women are now celebrities and TV personalities in their own right. Neither attended the remote hearing, with Judge Whalan declaring they ""can both part to put this matter behind them"". Mrs Vardy's barrister, Juliet Wells, had argued that Mrs Rooney was claiming ""grossly disproportionate"" costs, recommending they were capped at ""no more than £100,000"". In written submissions, Ms Wells said Mrs Rooney's original £1.8m legal bill was ""substandard"" and included costs ""of briefing the press"" and others to which she had ""no entitlement"". But lawyers for Mrs Rooney said in their written submissions that Mrs Vardy was ""the author of her own misfortune"" and that she should ""reflect upon her approach""."
Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde21wnlrpjo,"Singer Rihanna has confirmed she is expecting her third baby while attending fashion's biggest night of the year, the Met Gala in New York. The 37-year-old cradled her bump and smiled for the cameras while appearing on the red carpet, which was navy with daffodils. Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, and her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, already have two sons. A$AP Rocky, also known as Rakim Mayers, thanked reporters who offered their congratulations on the red carpet. ""It is time to just show the people what we were cooking up,"" he said. Rihanna was the last to arrive at the benefit event for New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which marks the opening of its Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit. Each year celebrities wear extravagant outfits in line with the event's theme. This year's concept was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,"" the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the couple's pregnancy news on the red carpet. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" the rapper said. ""I'm glad everybody's happy for us because we're definitely happy"", he added. The couple's first son RZA was born in May 2022 and their second son, Riot, was born in August 2023. The pop star and businesswoman is known for her high-profile pregnancy announcements. She debuted the pregnancy of her first child with a photoshoot with her partner in Harlem, New York City in 2022. When she performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 she revealed she was expecting their second child. She's not the first star to reveal their baby bump at the Met Gala - the former tennis player, Serena Williams and model Karlie Kloss both publicly revealed their pregnancies at the 2023 event."
Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01kx3yrmvo,"Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries. Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying ""a very fast death"". In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a ""calm and steady approach"" to talks in a bid to ""ease pressure on UK businesses"". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being ""jobless"" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a ""knock-out blow"". The UK film sector is worth £1.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October. Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed. White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit. ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said. Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is ""dominated"" by inward investment from US studios and that this ""brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK"". Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned ""against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe"" when the report came out. ""President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,"" she said. Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios. She urged ministers to ""urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way"". Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must ""get a grip"" to secure a trade deal with the US and ""protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success"". It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: ""The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means. ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot? ""Hollywood… has been in decline for some time,"" he said. ""A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia."" He added: ""One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world."" Bell concurred that ""the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places"" and lower costs. ""People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed."" She added: ""The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood."" According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20 percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (£248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive. A government spokesperson said on Monday: ""The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world. ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon. ""Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers."" Dozens of Hollywood blockbusters in recent years have actually seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, including:"
12 of the best films to watch this May,Thunderbolts* to Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning: 12 of the best films to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250423-12-of-the-best-films-to-watch-in-may,"The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream. Cobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance – and as Mr Miyagi once explained, ""Balance is key"". ""Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film – even though they're separate ecosystems – it all made sense for me,"" Macchio said in Variety. ""Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?"" Released on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally Danny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family. ""We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,"" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. ""They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me."" Released on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally The co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells ""the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of"". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed – and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is ""a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive"", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com. Released on 16 May on Apple+ internationally There were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. ""Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,"" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. ""Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed."" Well… maybe. Released on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally In 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri – and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a ""shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre"". Fans of the first film will ""cherish this divinely twisted thriller"". Released on 1 May on Prime Video internationally Tim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian ""breaks up"" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is ""feverishly and hilariously demented"", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. ""Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year."" Released on 9 May in the US Admittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures – so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial. Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally Nicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is ""a gloriously demented B-movie thriller"", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks ""the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic"". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. ""Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,"" says Brooks, ""The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe."" Released on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia Jane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen herself? ""The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,"" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots. Released on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK The original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 – and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. ""You gotta see the movie,"" he told Empire magazine. ""It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience."" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word ""Final"" is in there for a reason. ""It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,"" he says. ""I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate."" Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally It seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles – and enviable kitchens – of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far? Released on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW ""After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,"" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, ""a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top."" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. ""It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,"" says Marric. ""It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.""

10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,The Four Seasons to And Just Like That…: 10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-10-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-may,"From Tina Fey's new relationship comedy to an action drama from the creator of Lost, and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker and co in the third season of the Sex and the City sequel. Tine Fey stars in and co-created this comedy about three couples, long-time friends with enough disposable income to vacation together four times a year through different seasons. As in the 1981 film it is based on, everyone is rattled when one pair heads for divorce. Fey and Will Forte play one of the couples. Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani are another, a same-sex twist that is the most obvious update from '81. And Steve Carell plays a man who is leaving his wife (Kerri Kenney-Silver) for a younger woman (Erika Henningsen), a timeless part of the plot. Fey has called the show ""a love letter to long-term relationships, both platonic and romantic"", adding, ""I hope audiences feel like they are inside a big sweater with us, and also having a dinner party with us."" So if you like dinner parties in chunky sweaters, this is the show for you. The Four Seasons premieres 1 May on Netflix internationally Star Natasha Lyonne and creator Rian Johnson (Knives Out) have brought their popular homage to the classic Peter Falk series Columbo, and 1970s television in general, back for a second season. Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who has an incredible knack for running across murders, scoping out who's telling the truth and who's lying, and solving the case by the end of the episode. Now on the run from a different crime boss than in the first season, Charlie is still on the road, travelling to a different place in every episode, each featuring a slew of guest stars. This time they include Cynthia Erivo, Awkwafina, Giancarlo Esposito, Kumail Nanjiani, John Mulaney, Katie Holmes and about two dozen others, as Charlie stumbles across trouble at a funeral home, a baseball game and an alligator farm. Running through it all are Lyonne's trademark sardonic delivery and the series's fast-paced retro feel. Poker Face premieres 8 May on Peacock in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK Judy Blume's 1975 YA novel about first love is reimagined with an update in this series set in Los Angeles in 2018, with a cast largely composed of black actors. High school students Keisha (Lovie Simone), a track star, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), a basketball player, are childhood friends who lost touch. When they meet again at a party and fall in love, they face all the intense feelings and decisions that brings. Over the years, Blume's novel has been banned in several US states for the direct way its characters confront the question of when to have their first sexual experience (Blume's honesty is exactly what many fans like about her) and the issue needed a new lens for the 21st Century. But the series' showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, has also leant into the timeless theme of romance, and the Los Angeles setting feeds into it. ""What better metaphor for this love story than what LA represents,"" she has said. ""You're looking for a place to follow your dreams, and love is a part of that."" Forever premieres 8 May on Netflix internationally Retro television is having a moment with Poker Face and this action drama set in 1972 in the Southwest US. JJ Abrams is an executive producer and, along with LaToya Morgan, wrote the first two episodes of the series, which stars Josh Holloway, still best known as Sawyer from Abrams's Lost, as a swaggering driver for a crime syndicate. Rachel Hilson plays the first black female FBI agent, who chases him down, with Keith David as the syndicate's boss. In addition to the cat-and-mouse crime story and possibly wavering loyalties, Duster has knife fights, cars flipping over and dust all around. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter that the series came about because ""I had this image of a phone booth in the middle of the desert and a car driving up, and a guy getting on the phone to find out where he was meant to go next"". That turned into a show that he calls ""a crazy story"" with humour, absurdity and lots of plot turns. Duster premieres 15 May on Max in the US Television is full of sci-fi series, but this one has a comic twist and Alexander Skarsgård, as a robot who manages to hack its own system and go rogue. ""I am a security unit,"" it announces in its cheery voiceover. ""I was built to protect and obey humans. And humans are idiots."" Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy) created the show, based on Martha Wells' series of books, The Murderbot Diaries, and have given it a Blade Runner-meets-Black Mirror style. Although the title robot calls itself Murderbot, it doesn't really want to kill anyone. It prefers sitting around bingeing its favourite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a series-within-the-series with John Cho and Jack McBrayer playing the leads. When it lands on a new planet, its social awkwardness creates a very human problem, which makes it, Skarsgård told Empire magazine, ""more relatable than most characters I've ever played"". Of course, he has played Tarzan and a vampire, so relatable is a relative thing. Murderbot premieres 16 May on Apple TV+ internationally Nicole Kidman and her collection of improbable wigs – see The Undoing or The Perfect Couple – are now television mainstays. In season two of this series based on a Liane Moriarty novel, she returns as psychedelic-dispensing wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko, still Russian-accented but now with a pin-straight bob instead of a waist-length mop of waves. She has also relocated her week-long retreat from sunny California to the snowy Austrian Alps, where another crop of troubled, privileged characters turn up – like The White Lotus but with a cult-like, possibly charlatan therapist. As Kidman told Vanity Fair about Masha, ""She morphs. She adapts."" New characters are played by another starry cast, including Henry Golding, Christine Baranski, Mark Strong, Lena Olin and Murray Bartlett. Let the wig-games begin. Vulture has even ranked them. Nine Perfect Strangers premieres 21 May on Hulu in the US and 22 May on Amazon Prime Video in the UK Julianne Moore and Meghann Fahy star in this dark comedy about power, class and control, set over one weekend on a wealthy resort island. Moore plays Michaela, a philanthropist and animal activist who is also iron-fisted in her control of island society. Her personal assistant, Simone (Milly Alcock, who played the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragons), is so in thrall to her that Simone's sister, Devon, (Fahy) comes to the island to stage an intervention. Kevin Bacon plays Michaela's billionaire husband, with Glenn Howerton and Bill Camp among the supporting cast. The series was created by Molly Smith Metzler, who also created the hit Netflix series Maid. She based Sirens on her 2011 play Elemeno Pea, and has said that the show has ""a Greek mythology vibe"", presumably because Michaela sends out such a siren's call to Simone. But details are scarce, so for all we know this siren, as in mythology, could turn out to be half bird. Fully human or not, Moore is always worth watching. Sirens premieres 22 May on Netflix internationally Matthew Goode stars in this crime thriller, the latest show from Scott Frank, the creator of terrific series including The Queen's Gambit and Monsieur Spade. The hero, Carl Morck (Goode), is an abrasive detective in Edinburgh whose partner has been paralyzed on the job, sending him into a tailspin and landing him a low-profile role as head of a new cold-case unit called Department Q. Headquartered in a basement, his unit of misfits is meant to be no more than a publicity move for the police – but as in Slow Horses, the band of outcasts is smarter than their prized colleagues. Frank based the show on a series of Danish novels and changed the setting to Edinburgh, where it was shot. Meanwhile, Morck has been made into an Englishman, a fish out of water whose ex-wife is Scottish, which accounts for his very bad attitude toward all Scots. The top-flight cast includes Kelly Macdonald and Shirley Henderson. Dept Q premieres 29 May on Netflix internationally An unlikely family tangle is beneath the plot of this thriller with Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks as estranged sisters who have very different lives. Biel plays Chloe, a polished media executive who lives in upscale comfort with her lawyer husband (Corey Stoll) and teenage son. Banks plays Nicky, a recovering addict who is struggling financially. When someone in the family is murdered, the death and their old sibling rivalry converge, as the sisters come together to find the truth of what happened. Lorraine Toussaint, Matthew Modine and Gloria Reuben are also in the cast. Olivia Milch, who co-created the show with Regina Corrado (based on a 2019 novel by Alafair Burke) told Glamour that the question of which sister is better ""changes moment to moment"", which sounds just right for a thriller. The Better Sister premieres 29 May on Prime Video internationally As she ambles into her next chapter in life, nearly 30 years after Sex and the City premiered, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) still has great shoes, as seen in the trailer for the third season of this sequel series. The new season puts her where the last one ended, in a new apartment and trying a long-distance relationship with Aiden (John Corbett). But Carrie is now writing a novel, instead of the personal column she used to write. As always, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) have their own issues. Sarita Choudhury and Nicole Ari Parker return as recently-acquired core friends Seema and Lisa, while Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone appear as brand new characters. The show has inspired long-loyal, opinionated fans, who will want to know whether or not two old favourites are missing: Che Diaz (Sarah Ramirez), Miranda's former partner who was a love-them or hate-them character, and Kim Cattrall, whose phoned-in cameo as Samantha last season – really, she was shown in a car on the phone for a minute – was a fizzle.

The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,'It was the cleverest escape in the prison's 30 years': The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240607-it-was-the-cleverest-escape-in-the-prisons-30-years-the-men-who-broke-out-of-alcatraz-with-a-spoon,"On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape – from what was the US's most secure prison – continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime. In May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made ""the most feared journey in the criminal world"" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed ""the Rock"", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped. Alcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". ""Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,"" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it. Four years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night. When the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. ""A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,"" he said. ""Built over the rambling passages of an old fort… the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up."" With Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-mâché grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood. But while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-mâché versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place. More like this: • How D-Day began with a death-defying mission • The US couple who survived the Alaskan wilderness • Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death' Finally, on the night of 11 June 1962, they were ready to put their ingenious plan into motion. Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it – carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower – shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered. The island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. ""When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,"" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. ""I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was."" The prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again. Although the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964."" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,"" he said. ""Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?"" Alcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: ""the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners"". Over the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves – unable to face the unrelenting conditions – and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment. As for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service. But speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them. In 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read ""I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!"" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not. The case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.

The Cold War spy mystery of the vanishing frogman,'He swam out to the Russian vessel and was never seen alive again': The Cold War spy mystery of the 'vanishing frogman',https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250501-the-cold-war-spy-mystery-of-buster-crabb,"In 1956, Royal Navy Commander ""Buster"" Crabb disappeared in murky circumstances during a visit to the UK by Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan read the newly declassified files that detailed Crabb's unofficial secret mission – and how the government tried to cover it up. It was on 9 May 1956, 68 years ago this week, that UK Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden finally succumbed to press pressure and international embarrassment, and ordered an enquiry into the mysterious disappearance of Royal Navy diver Commander Lionel ""Buster"" Crabb. The decorated frogman had vanished during a goodwill visit to the UK by the Soviet leadership at the height of Cold War tensions. When word leaked that Crabb had gone missing, The Admiralty, the government department responsible for the Navy, issued a vague statement that the diver had been testing underwater equipment at Stokes Bay on the Hampshire coast and was presumed drowned. But the story fell apart when the visiting Russians accused their hosts of espionage. The Soviets claimed that they had seen a frogman near the Ordzhonikidze – the ship that had brought the Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev to the UK – while it was docked in Portsmouth Harbour. Despite questions being asked repeatedly in Parliament, Eden refused to say more, claiming: ""It would not be in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which Commander Crabb is presumed to have met his death."" The government's stonewalling merely heightened suspicions that Crabb had been on a covert spy mission. Fourteen months after Crabb vanished, a headless, handless body in a diving suit was found by fishermen in Chichester Harbour on the south coast of England. Its lack of fingerprints and teeth made the mutilated body difficult to identify, but a later inquest ruled that it was Crabb. The whole episode publicly embarrassed Eden and wrecked his attempts to develop a more friendly relationship with a post-Stalin Soviet Union. When he disappeared in 1956, Crabb was well known for his daring underwater exploits. Nicknamed ""Buster"", after the US Olympic swimmer and actor Buster Crabbe, who had risen to fame in the 1930s, he was an expert in underwater bomb disposal. His bravery during World War Two had earned him the George Medal for removing Italian limpet mines from British warships at Malta, and an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his mine clearance work at Livorno in Italy. His wartime amphibious adventures would later be fictionalised in a 1958 film, The Silent Enemy, with Crabb being played by Laurence Harvey. And even after he was officially demobbed in 1947, he continued diving for the military in various capacities, including investigating sunken submarines. For decades following the frogman's disappearance, the UK government staunchly maintained its silence on the incident. It would only be from 2006 onwards, when due to Freedom of Information requests by the BBC, and classified documents being made public under the 50-year rule, that the murky circumstances of Crabb's ill-fated final dive began to emerge. The declassified files showed that, from the start, the UK's security services were keen to use the opportunity of Khruschev's visit to gather intelligence on their Cold War opponents. They suggested hiding microphones in Claridge's hotel, which the Soviet leadership intended to use as their headquarters during their stay. But the prime minister expressly ruled out the idea and made ""clear that adventures of a similar nature were forbidden"". Despite this, MI6 recruited Crabb to undertake an ""unofficial enterprise"" to investigate the Russian ship Ordzhonikidze. The exact nature of his mission is still unclear, but the ex-MI5 officer Peter Wright suggested in his book Spycatcher (1987) that it was to examine and photograph the ship's advanced propeller design. Two days before the mission, Crabb and another MI6 agent, who went by the name Bernard Smith, checked into the Sally Port hotel in Portsmouth. On the evening of 17 April 1956, Crabb met with a military colleague in a local pub. This colleague, whose name was deleted from the file, was a Royal Navy lieutenant commander who agreed to help Crabb get into Portsmouth Harbour for his final dive. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan got the chance to examine the previously classified sworn statement by ""the last man to see Crabb alive"". ""He says he was approached by the commander a couple of days before his final dive and asked 'if I would be prepared to assist him, entirely unofficially and in a strictly private capacity, in connection with a dive he was taking a day or two later'. He goes on to say under no account was this man to contact any responsible naval authority,"" said Buchanan. More like this: • The greatest sailing rescue ever made • A death-defying D-Day mission in a wooden glider • The US's most damaging double agent Just before 07:00 on 19 April, the unnamed lieutenant commander went with Crabb to Portsmouth Harbour, and helped him dress and check his equipment. Crabb then swam out to the Russian vessel, and was never seen alive again. The Royal Navy made no attempt to look for the missing frogman for fear of alerting the Ordzhonikidze's crew. ""The documents further reveal that no search and rescue efforts were made for Crabb as it was not a bonafide operation,"" said Buchanan. ""And they detailed the extensive efforts made by [the Admiralty] to ensure they weren't implicated in a botched mission they knew nothing about."" The intelligence services surmised that Crabb must have either been captured by the Soviets, been destroyed by Russian ""countermeasures"", or suffered a ""natural mishap"". Smith, the MI6 agent, removed Crabb's belongings and checked out of the Sally Port hotel. A few days later, the police removed the pages with their details from the Sally Port's register, which only served to fuel suspicions of a covert mission. Under pressure from MI6 and the government, the Admiralty hastily concocted the spurious story that Crabb had gone missing during a test in Stokes Bay. Records of meetings show the panic at the highest levels of government. Officials feared that if a body was found, the Soviets could use Crabb's death for propaganda purposes. National Archives' Howard Davis told the BBC in 2006 that the file ""makes it perfectly clear that this wasn't an Admiralty operation; they had nothing to do with it and we see them trying to construct a story that they can plausibly tell to face the inevitable questions from the press"". But despite the release of some of the government's classified documents, exactly what happened to the diver that day in 1956 is still unknown. In 1990, Joseph Zwerkin, a former Soviet naval intelligence agent, claimed that a Soviet sniper on the Ordzhonikidze's deck had spotted the diver in the water and shot him. In 2007, a 74-year-old former Russian frogman, Eduard Koltsov, claimed that he slashed Crabb's throat in an underwater fight after catching him attaching a mine to Ordzhonikidze. It has also been suggested that as Crabb was an associate of Sir Anthony Blunt, who was unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1979, he could even have defected. Nicholas Elliott, a former senior MI6 agent who was rumoured to be involved in Crabb's final dive, believed that the 47-year-old diver, who was known for his fondness for whiskey and cigarettes, had succumbed to oxygen poisoning or a heart attack as a result of his exertions while underwater. It may be some time before more details of Crabb's fate come to light. While some papers concerning the affair have been released into the public domain, others have had their classified status extended by the government and are not scheduled for release until 2057. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

"The long tradition of black dandyism, this year's Met Gala theme",'Clothes can contain a lot of emotion': How black men have used flamboyant fashion to express pride and resistance,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250502-how-black-men-have-used-bold-fashion-as-resistance,"This year's Costume Institute spring exhibition and Met Gala are honouring black ""dandy"" style, and the tradition of bold tailoring worn by black men that has made a statement. Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history. The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), ""arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed"". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities – in a context where the very concept of ""blackness"" was created by non-black oppressors. Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme ""Tailored for you"" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James. The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The ""superfine"" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to ""a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'"" – a reminder that how you dress can contain ""a lot of emotion"". Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. ""Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,"" Miller tells the BBC. ""It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised."" Dandyism was already laying its foundations. In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters – in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman. However, in the case of Julius Soubise – manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury – the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be. While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing – once again – boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman – complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles – in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with ""a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]"" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his ""master"" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England. Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of. In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them. The suit, explains Miller, is ""a historical throughline"" in the exhibition, which includes everything ""from livery garments… to tailcoats and different versions of it… to even track suiting"". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom. More like this: • Seven of the best Met Gala looks over the decades • Coachella looks from Lady Gaga to Sabrina Carpenter •The indigenous American supermodel bringing change When rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched ""Hammer pants"". Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as ""a dandy among dandies"", André Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. ""He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,"" writes Wintour. ""For André, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once."" For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Iké Udé, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. ""Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,"" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Udé, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. ""He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,"" explains Miller. ""It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit."" This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline ""designed by an immigrant"". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. ""He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,"" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, ""that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that"". Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. ""Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture."" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. ""It's very much related to a jazz riff,"" Miller adds. ""Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new…"" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025. The accompanying book by Monica L Miller is published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and distributed by Yale University Press. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The true story of the first-ever 'rock star' chef,The 'first celebrity chef': How 19th-Century cook Antonin Carême made extraordinary food fit for kings,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-how-19th-century-bad-boy-antonin-careme-made-food-rock-n-roll,"A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called ""King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"" – shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks. It's described as ""the story of the first celebrity chef"". The French language series Carême is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Carême, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today – giving birth to the very idea of the ""celebrity"" chef. Indeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Carême, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, ""he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,"" he tells the BBC. And Voisin's portrayal of Carême feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen – a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. The series is inspired by a biography of Carême and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a ""bookish innocent"" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Carême aged 25: ""He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater."" Kelly also describes Carême as ""ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic"" as a person – although the Carême on screen risks much for those he loves. Indeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Carême as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as ""the charm of fiction in the show"". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, ""He [Carême] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life… and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing."" What is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Carême's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University. ""He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,"" Freedman tells the BBC. ""He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Carême."" While some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience. Bourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid ""the usual period drama style"" in this story. ""I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Carême,"" he says. ""And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life."" Voisin says their idea of the chef was that he had ""a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me"". ""I love looking to the historical story of Carême, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society."" The historical Carême's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as ""the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"". He's often credited as a founder of French gastronomy and of Grande Cuisine (classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century). However, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman Guillaume Tirel, known as ""Taillevent"", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several restaurants still bear his name. Carême's status is, he says, ""a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs. ""So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant."" The young Carême's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Carême: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that the ""Reign of Terror"" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable pâtissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-Périgord, known as Talleyrand. Even if the real Carême didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now. ""We know that Carême worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Carême brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time."" Politics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, ""Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so"". The visuals directly link the food Carême cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Carême licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri. ""The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,"" Voisin says. ""Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection."" The link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Carême's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital ""had become the City of Light – and the capital of food"". The talk around the young Carême, he says, would have been ""of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris"". Carême's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says. ""I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,"" he tells the BBC. A French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. ""One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit."" The era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Carême's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from ""economic disaster"". ""Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,"" she says. ""That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Carême wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty."" A later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) – who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London – ""is really Carême's heir,"" Cooke says. ""Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,"" she explains. ""He was able to achieve Carême's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Carême could not, because Carême was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too."" (Carême did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.) The emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Carême Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour. In another nod to modernity, the young Carême in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's ""Showstopper"" category might trace its ancestry back to Carême's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France. But now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly ""celebrity"" chef ""My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adrià, who was at El Bulli, or René Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented."" There is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Carême – and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention. ""Although Carême's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,"" he says. ""I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together – food, love and politics.""

Thunderbolts* is 'the greatest Marvel in years' ★★★★☆,Thunderbolts* review: 'The greatest Marvel offering in years',https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-thunderbolts-film-review,"The latest in the superhero franchise ""is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun"", with a ""charismatic"" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber. Ever since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end. The Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called ""Infinity Saga"" – the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years. The key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods. There's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong – but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep. De Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better. One small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not. More like this: • A combat epic that 'does what film does best' • Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis' • Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' The underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts – and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes. At both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion – and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre. ★★★★☆ -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Why Sinners has become a box-office sensation,'It doesn't stick to the rules': The reason Sinners has become a true box-office sensation,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-the-reason-sinners-has-become-a-true-box-office-sensation,"After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises. In less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a ""rule-defying"" proposition that ""continues to defy all the odds"", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (£34m) against its opening $48m (£36m). ""Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,"" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be ""the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013"". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (£120m), against a $90m (£67m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner – just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that ""profitability remains a question mark"". Perhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film – but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves – which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: ""Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?"" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread. This unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material – or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station – but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as ""something to hide behind"". He wanted to make the most personal film he could – a ""love letter"" to a late uncle from Mississippi – and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions. More like this: • 10 of the best films of 2025 so far • The best films to watch in April • Warfare review: it 'does what film does best' In some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with ""must-see"" and ""must-talk-about"" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: ""I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo."" That could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g3ldd20vo,"The BBC has announced plans to make a Call the Midwife film as well as a prequel TV series set during the Second World War. It comes as filming begins for the 15th series of the BBC One drama, which follows a group of nurse midwives working in London's East End from the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will ""delve into the deeper past"", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The new, separate film and prequel projects will be written, created and produced by Thomas and executive producers Dame Pippa Harris and Ann Tricklebank, who will also oversee the production of series 16 of the programme together. The prequel series will feature ""some familiar (if much younger) faces"", Thomas said. She said that while she has ""never run out of stories for our midwives"", she had found herself ""yearning to delve into the deeper past"" than the years 1957 to 1971 which have been covered by the show. ""The Blitz years in the East End were extraordinary - filled with loss, togetherness, courage and joy,"" she said. Meanwhile, the film will see the ""much-loved"" regular characters ""take a short break from Poplar and test themselves in an unfamiliar landscape"", Ms Thomas said. The location of the film remains ""top secret"", she added - but said it would look ""absolutely fantastic"" on the big screen. The first series of the show was originally inspired by the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, who worked as a midwife and nurse in the community in Poplar. Dame Pippa said the prequel series and film project were being made partly for a ""new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face."" The 15th series will begin with a two-part Christmas special which will see characters travelling to Hong Kong on a mercy mission."

27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xvd10xv5o,"Monday night marked one of the world's biggest nights of fashion, as stars served up their most iconic looks for the annual Met Gala in New York City. The theme for this year's event was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"", the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. It was inspired by a newly unveiled exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume institute featuring the ""black dandy"", which Vogue says ""examines the importance of clothing and style to the formation of black identities in the Atlantic diaspora"". A-list celebrities including Zendaya, Demi Moore and Diana Ross brought their own interpretation to the theme, stunning in tailored suits and dramatic gowns. Here is a look at some of the highlights: Actress Zendaya, known for her dazzling red carpet style, opted for a wide-brimmed hat and tailored Louis Vuitton cream suit at this year's Met Gala. But there was one slight pop of colour: her manicured red nails. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny wore a brown Prada suit, which he said he worked on with the Italian fashion house for a few months before the event. He also stayed on theme by accessorising with embellished gloves, a brooch and a hat that paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage. ""We did something special,"" he said of his look. ""I feel good, and I hope people think I'm looking good."" US reality TV star Kim Kardashian wore an all-black ensemble by LA-based brand Chrome Hearts - a fitted leather top and skirt that she offset with diamond necklaces and two strings of pearls. She is, of course, no stranger to the Met Gala - having made headlines with a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in 2022, and a wet-look Thierry Mugler dress in 2019. Black British designer Grace Wales Bonner dressed British Formula One star Sir Lewis Hamilton for the night. Sir Lewis was a co-chair of this year's event. The pair have worked together in the past with Wales Bonner dressing Hamilton for the 2023 British Fashion Awards. Singer Chappell Roan brought a rare pop of colour to the Met's blue carpet, in a patchwork hot pink ensemble sourced from eBay. The singer worked with Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell on her outfit, while make-up artist Pat McGrath was behind her disco-inspired look. Demi Moore gave us another round of method dressing. The American actress's recent press tour for The Substance recalled the body horror themes of the film, while her awards campaign for the role of Elisabeth Sparkle saw her dressing for the glam statuettes. Moore understood the assignment for the Met Gala, coming as a literal men's tie in a sculptural black and white striped sequin gown from Thom Browne. Rihanna, typically one of the most stylish attendees at the Gala, returned to the Met steps this year in Marc Jacobs, debuting her pregnancy with co-chair of the evening A$AP Rocky. Legendary singer Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble, complete with feathers and a long train that required at least two assistants. On the carpet, Ross said her son persuaded her to attend this year's event. The last time she attended the Met Gala is 2003. She added she had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered on her dress train. Actress Sydney Sweeney wore a custom Miu Miu gown - her third time wearing the designer at the Met Gala. This time, her dress was complete with beaded fringe shoulders and gold hardware detailing on the neck. Speaking about her look, Sweeney said it paid homage to actress and painter Kim Novak. Sweeney is set to portray Novak in the upcoming film Scandalous. A custom-made Chanel look was Dua Lipa's choice this year. The chiffon dress, sequin tweed jacket and organza cape - all adorned with pearls, feathers and crystals - took some 2,000 hours to make. Sabrina Carpenter wore a burgundy Louis Vuitton bodysuit that featured all the tailoring of a regular suit. The singer said she worked with recording artist Pharrell Williams - also the men's creative director of Louis Vuitton - on the bottomless look. ""You're quite short, so no pants for you,"" Carpenter recalled Williams telling her. Irish actor Barry Keoghan wore a custom-made Valentino fit, with florals embroidered on the cuffs and a silk red scarf wrapped around the waist. New Zealand singer Lorde made a rare appearance at the Met Gala this year (she has not attended since 2021). She wore a metallic silver floor-length skirt set, and a matching bandeau and blazer designed by Thom Browne. Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Simone Biles brought a pop of colour to the Met Gala carpet with a striking blue minidress that featured a collared neckline, a long train and jewelled appliques. The dress was designed by Harbison Studio. Singer Coco Jones opted for a look designed by Indian brand Manish Malhotra. She wore a tailored cream and white look that featured ornate embroidery and a dramatic long-sleeve coat. Jones also wore a large statement necklace and Jimmy Choo heels. Actor and playwright Colman Domingo could have inspired this year's Met Gala theme, as he's been carrying the baton for well-dressed men on the red carpet for several years now. He donned a royal blue Valentino cloak that paid homage to Andre Leon Talley, former editor-at-large on Vogue whom Anna Wintour called ""a dandy among dandies."" The cape later was removed to reveal a second look underneath: a tailored, patterned suit complete with a big fabric, polka-dotted flower brooch. Actress and singer Teyana Taylor, who hosted Vogue's live stream of the red carpet, arrived in custom Marc Jacobs on the arm of costume designer Ruth E. Carter. Ms Carter has worked with filmmaker Spike Lee and on the Black Panther movie franchise to create some modern pop cultural cues for the black dandy. Taylor wore a burgundy cape embroidered with ""Harlem Rose,"" a nod to her 2018 song A Rose in Harlem. Social media influencer Emma Chamberlain looked sharp and on theme with a backless tailored suit dress designed by French fashion house Courrèges. She accessorised the look with a spiky beach blonde pixie cut and stylish eyeglasses. Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, known for her on-theme style, wore a Givenchy ensemble featuring a bedazzled bodice and an extra-long black train with matching leather boots and nails. Recording artist Doja Cat wore a custom Marc Jacobs look that featured giant shoulder pads and a leopard-print bustier panel. ""I just wanted to feel like a little gangsta,"" she said. ""I feel like he brought that with the strong shape of the shoulders, and all of the exaggerated shapes,"" Doja Cat said of Jacobs. Actress Tracee Ellis Ross, the daughter of Diana Ross, was one of the few people who wore pink at this year's Met Gala. She donned a custom Marc Jacobs suit that was complete with a giant, hot pink bow at the back, a matching top hat and some unique bling. In one of the more memorable looks of the evening, Andre 3000 showed up to the Met Gala carpet with a black and white piano strapped to his back and a trash bag as a purse. The stylish OutKast rapper designed the look himself in collaboration with Burberry. Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o wore a stunning powder blue Chanel suit, with a matching hat and transparent cape. She accessorised the look with bedazzled, black rhinestone eyebrows. Rapper Cardi B debuted a new hairstyle (and eye colour) in a green Burberry pantsuit, complete with matching nails and eye shadow. Doechii took brand representation to new levels, stamping the famous Louis Vuitton logo on her face to go along with the motif of her suit. The American rapper is often seen wearing looks from the French fashion house. This outfit combined the designer's two famous patterns - the LV monogram pattern on the waistcoat and jacket, as well as the damier checkerboard on the shorts. When asked about her outfit on the carpet, Janelle Monáe responded simply - ""free"" - followed by an expletive. ""And when I'm in my suit, that is exactly how I feel,"" she said. She wore a Thom Brown suit, with whom she's attended the Met Gala as a guest for the last several years. The look is styled by the Academy Award-winning costume designer for Wicked, Paul Tazewell. Pop legend Madonna accessorised her cream-colored tuxedo with a cigar, creating an interplay between soft feminine materials and a distinct masculine energy. It's a dynamic that the superstar has played with throughout her career."
Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g03g71qno,"The home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant Khrystyna Starykova has been destroyed by Russian shelling in the city of Myrnograd. The 19-year-old is currently in Switzerland rehearsing for her performance with the band Ziferblat, but posted photos of her damaged apartment block in the Sviltly neighbourhood. ""Home. And I dreamed so much of returning home,"" she captioned the post, which showed the building shrouded in smoke, with its windows blown out and several balconies collapsed. ""Fortunately, all my relatives and friends are alive and well,"" she said, and vowed to perform at Eurovision next week ""for the sake of our country"". ""[I want] to show what a strong people we are."" In an interview with Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne, Starykova said she had almost anticipated the destruction of her home. ""Four months ago, my grandmother lost her home - it was just such a big hole,"" she said. ""Then my aunt lost the roof over her head. ""I understood that maybe I could be the next one and, unfortunately, it happened. It's very terrible news. I had really hoped to go back."" The singer's home is less than five miles from the frontline, near the industrial city of Pokrovsk, a key battleground on Ukraine's eastern front. In a new Instagram post on Tuesday morning, she shared further footage of Myrnograd's bomb-damaged streets. ""I always went home from vocal lessons this way,"" she wrote in the caption. ""It was my favourite way home."" Ziferblat will represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest with Bird of Pray, a song telling the story of Ukrainians who have been separated from their loved ones by the war with Russia. ""It's about our problems we go through, the tragedy for the last three years,"" singer Valentyn Leshchynskyi told Eurovision fansite Wiwibloggs. ""To be honest, the last eleven years."" Starykova is a backing vocalist for the band, affectionately known as ""bird girl"" as she handles the song's high notes. She previously competed in the Ukrainian version of the TV talent show The Voice, reaching the grand final, where she performed a cover of Duncan Lawrence's Eurovision winner, Arcade. Born in Donetsk, she spent her childhood in Myrnograd, living through fierce battles between Russian-supported separatists and Ukrainian government forces in the region. ""When it all started, I was just in shock,"" she later told local news outlet The Eastern Variant, recalling the heavy shelling that hit Myrnograd in 2015. ""The whole sky lit up and we started running to hide in the corridor,"" she said. ""That was the first time I felt it all."" The family later moved to Kyiv, where Starykova studied at the renowned Glière Music College - but she always intended to move back to her hometown. In a TV interview, she said it was important to go ahead with her Eurovision performance as a display of resilience. ""Despite what happened to me, I want to portray our song in a good way,"" she said. ""And just to convey our main message, that everything will be fine. ""Despite our troubles, we will survive. I'm holding on for us."""
Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2jjg10xlo,"Actress Alicia Vikander is set to make her UK theatre debut in a new production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, producers have confirmed. It will mark the Oscar winner's first stage role of any kind for 17 years, following a successful run of film and TV performances. The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday. Vikander told BBC News she was ""thrilled"" to be returning to theatre, but added it was a ""daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult"". The play has been adapted and directed by Simon Stone, and will also star The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln. Speaking from her home in north London, Vikander recalled the influence the theatre had on her when she was younger. ""I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,"" she recalled. ""Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden. ""So I think that's what I always saw in front of me. And then, life happened, and throughout the years [theatre] has always been something I've been waiting for and thinking 'it will happen'."" Vikander has certainly been busy in the meantime. The 36-year-old has starred in Tomb Raider, Ex Machina and Testament of Youth, and won a best supporting actress Oscar for her performance opposite Eddie Redmayne in 2015's The Danish Girl. Vikander will play lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper. Ellida is married to a Norwegian doctor, but when a sailor she used to be engaged to suddenly returns, she is forced to choose between her current and former lover. The play marks the introduction of the character Hilde Wangel, one of the doctor's daughters from a previous marriage. Hilde goes on to appear in one of Ibsen's later plays, The Master Builder, a new adaptation of which is coincidentally also currently in the West End, starring Ewan McGregor. An adaptation of another Ibsen play, Enemy of the People, opened in London last year starring Doctor Who actor Matt Smith. Director Stone has previously helmed films such as The Dig and The Daughter, while his extensive theatre credits include productions of Yerma, Phaedra, Medea and Angels in America. ""He once again is going to take a classic and reinvent it and make it be something that is relatable to our modern audience today,"" Vikander said. ""And when I was told he was doing Ibsen and The Lady from the Sea, I guess that going back to my Scandinavian and Swedish heritage, it kind of felt like a perfect match."" Vikander said she felt the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today. ""I have discussions with my friends, I just passed 35, I'm getting close to my 40s soon and I have my kids, but I still feel extremely young. Really young. Sometimes I'm like, 'I'm 25 still!' ""But then I also realise I'm entering this very new chapter which is really exciting, but I think if you are in a place where you feel like you haven't fulfilled certain dreams or tried things, you're still wondering where these choices or action would have led you, then I think it's extremely human thing. ""Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother. ""So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories."" She aded: ""It's incredible that the big universal questions are something we're still battling in the same way."" Vikander said she was ""super excited and wonderfully nervous"" to begin the workshopping process with Stone in the coming weeks, out of which he will begin to produce the final script. As the show is still being developed, it has not yet been confirmed what the setting will be for this production. Another UK adaptation of The Lady from the Sea performed in 2017 at the Donmar Theatre moved the story to the Caribbean in the 1950s. The new adaptation is billed as her UK stage debut, but Vikander notes it's actually her first theatre of any kind since she was 19. ""I did theatre for my teens for a lot of years, like a child actor, and then the last thing I did was when I was a dancer for the Stockholm Opera House,"" she explained. ""I grew up watching my mother doing theatre, and I 'd always watch from afar, and I can't wait to try and do it myself. ""It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited."""
Vardy must pay £1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,Vardy must pay £1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7939wwxd0jo,"Rebekah Vardy must pay more than £1.4m of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their libel battle, a judge has said. Mrs Rooney ran up a legal bill totalling more than £1.8m while successfully defending herself against Mrs Vardy's High Court claim in 2022. After Mrs Vardy lost the case, court documents showed she had been ordered to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's costs. Earlier on Tuesday, a specialist costs court was told that Mrs Vardy had agreed to pay £1.19m to Mrs Rooney, who was also asking for a further £315,000 in ""assessment costs"". Costs judge Mark Whalan then said it was ""reasonable and proportionate"" for Mrs Vardy to pay her an additional £212,266. This took the total to just over £1.4m, including interest. He said he was ""generally happy"" that the outcome represented a ""commercially satisfactory conclusion for both sides"", but noted there had been ""extraordinary expenditure of costs"" by the parties. ""I do mean it when I say that I hope that this is the end of a long and unhappy road."" Mrs Rooney is the wife of ex-England footballer Wayne Rooney, while Mrs Vardy is married to his former team-mate Jamie Vardy. Both women are now celebrities and TV personalities in their own right. Neither attended the remote hearing, with Judge Whalan declaring they ""can both part to put this matter behind them"". Mrs Vardy's barrister, Juliet Wells, had argued that Mrs Rooney was claiming ""grossly disproportionate"" costs, recommending they were capped at ""no more than £100,000"". In written submissions, Ms Wells said Mrs Rooney's original £1.8m legal bill was ""substandard"" and included costs ""of briefing the press"" and others to which she had ""no entitlement"". But lawyers for Mrs Rooney said in their written submissions that Mrs Vardy was ""the author of her own misfortune"" and that she should ""reflect upon her approach""."
Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde21wnlrpjo,"Singer Rihanna has confirmed she is expecting her third baby while attending fashion's biggest night of the year, the Met Gala in New York. The 37-year-old cradled her bump and smiled for the cameras while appearing on the red carpet, which was navy with daffodils. Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, and her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, already have two sons. A$AP Rocky, also known as Rakim Mayers, thanked reporters who offered their congratulations on the red carpet. ""It is time to just show the people what we were cooking up,"" he said. Rihanna was the last to arrive at the benefit event for New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which marks the opening of its Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit. Each year celebrities wear extravagant outfits in line with the event's theme. This year's concept was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,"" the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the couple's pregnancy news on the red carpet. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" the rapper said. ""I'm glad everybody's happy for us because we're definitely happy"", he added. The couple's first son RZA was born in May 2022 and their second son, Riot, was born in August 2023. The pop star and businesswoman is known for her high-profile pregnancy announcements. She debuted the pregnancy of her first child with a photoshoot with her partner in Harlem, New York City in 2022. When she performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 she revealed she was expecting their second child. She's not the first star to reveal their baby bump at the Met Gala - the former tennis player, Serena Williams and model Karlie Kloss both publicly revealed their pregnancies at the 2023 event."
Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01kx3yrmvo,"Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries. Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying ""a very fast death"". In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a ""calm and steady approach"" to talks in a bid to ""ease pressure on UK businesses"". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being ""jobless"" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a ""knock-out blow"". The UK film sector is worth £1.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October. Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed. White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit. ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said. Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is ""dominated"" by inward investment from US studios and that this ""brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK"". Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned ""against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe"" when the report came out. ""President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,"" she said. Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios. She urged ministers to ""urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way"". Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must ""get a grip"" to secure a trade deal with the US and ""protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success"". It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: ""The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means. ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot? ""Hollywood… has been in decline for some time,"" he said. ""A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia."" He added: ""One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world."" Bell concurred that ""the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places"" and lower costs. ""People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed."" She added: ""The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood."" According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20 percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (£248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive. A government spokesperson said on Monday: ""The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world. ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon. ""Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers."" Dozens of Hollywood blockbusters in recent years have actually seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, including:"
12 of the best films to watch this May,Thunderbolts* to Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning: 12 of the best films to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250423-12-of-the-best-films-to-watch-in-may,"The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream. Cobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance – and as Mr Miyagi once explained, ""Balance is key"". ""Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film – even though they're separate ecosystems – it all made sense for me,"" Macchio said in Variety. ""Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?"" Released on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally Danny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family. ""We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,"" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. ""They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me."" Released on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally The co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells ""the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of"". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed – and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is ""a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive"", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com. Released on 16 May on Apple+ internationally There were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. ""Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,"" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. ""Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed."" Well… maybe. Released on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally In 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri – and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a ""shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre"". Fans of the first film will ""cherish this divinely twisted thriller"". Released on 1 May on Prime Video internationally Tim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian ""breaks up"" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is ""feverishly and hilariously demented"", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. ""Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year."" Released on 9 May in the US Admittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures – so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial. Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally Nicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is ""a gloriously demented B-movie thriller"", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks ""the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic"". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. ""Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,"" says Brooks, ""The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe."" Released on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia Jane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen herself? ""The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,"" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots. Released on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK The original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 – and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. ""You gotta see the movie,"" he told Empire magazine. ""It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience."" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word ""Final"" is in there for a reason. ""It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,"" he says. ""I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate."" Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally It seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles – and enviable kitchens – of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far? Released on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW ""After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,"" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, ""a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top."" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. ""It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,"" says Marric. ""It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.""

10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,The Four Seasons to And Just Like That…: 10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-10-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-may,"From Tina Fey's new relationship comedy to an action drama from the creator of Lost, and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker and co in the third season of the Sex and the City sequel. Tine Fey stars in and co-created this comedy about three couples, long-time friends with enough disposable income to vacation together four times a year through different seasons. As in the 1981 film it is based on, everyone is rattled when one pair heads for divorce. Fey and Will Forte play one of the couples. Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani are another, a same-sex twist that is the most obvious update from '81. And Steve Carell plays a man who is leaving his wife (Kerri Kenney-Silver) for a younger woman (Erika Henningsen), a timeless part of the plot. Fey has called the show ""a love letter to long-term relationships, both platonic and romantic"", adding, ""I hope audiences feel like they are inside a big sweater with us, and also having a dinner party with us."" So if you like dinner parties in chunky sweaters, this is the show for you. The Four Seasons premieres 1 May on Netflix internationally Star Natasha Lyonne and creator Rian Johnson (Knives Out) have brought their popular homage to the classic Peter Falk series Columbo, and 1970s television in general, back for a second season. Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who has an incredible knack for running across murders, scoping out who's telling the truth and who's lying, and solving the case by the end of the episode. Now on the run from a different crime boss than in the first season, Charlie is still on the road, travelling to a different place in every episode, each featuring a slew of guest stars. This time they include Cynthia Erivo, Awkwafina, Giancarlo Esposito, Kumail Nanjiani, John Mulaney, Katie Holmes and about two dozen others, as Charlie stumbles across trouble at a funeral home, a baseball game and an alligator farm. Running through it all are Lyonne's trademark sardonic delivery and the series's fast-paced retro feel. Poker Face premieres 8 May on Peacock in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK Judy Blume's 1975 YA novel about first love is reimagined with an update in this series set in Los Angeles in 2018, with a cast largely composed of black actors. High school students Keisha (Lovie Simone), a track star, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), a basketball player, are childhood friends who lost touch. When they meet again at a party and fall in love, they face all the intense feelings and decisions that brings. Over the years, Blume's novel has been banned in several US states for the direct way its characters confront the question of when to have their first sexual experience (Blume's honesty is exactly what many fans like about her) and the issue needed a new lens for the 21st Century. But the series' showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, has also leant into the timeless theme of romance, and the Los Angeles setting feeds into it. ""What better metaphor for this love story than what LA represents,"" she has said. ""You're looking for a place to follow your dreams, and love is a part of that."" Forever premieres 8 May on Netflix internationally Retro television is having a moment with Poker Face and this action drama set in 1972 in the Southwest US. JJ Abrams is an executive producer and, along with LaToya Morgan, wrote the first two episodes of the series, which stars Josh Holloway, still best known as Sawyer from Abrams's Lost, as a swaggering driver for a crime syndicate. Rachel Hilson plays the first black female FBI agent, who chases him down, with Keith David as the syndicate's boss. In addition to the cat-and-mouse crime story and possibly wavering loyalties, Duster has knife fights, cars flipping over and dust all around. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter that the series came about because ""I had this image of a phone booth in the middle of the desert and a car driving up, and a guy getting on the phone to find out where he was meant to go next"". That turned into a show that he calls ""a crazy story"" with humour, absurdity and lots of plot turns. Duster premieres 15 May on Max in the US Television is full of sci-fi series, but this one has a comic twist and Alexander Skarsgård, as a robot who manages to hack its own system and go rogue. ""I am a security unit,"" it announces in its cheery voiceover. ""I was built to protect and obey humans. And humans are idiots."" Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy) created the show, based on Martha Wells' series of books, The Murderbot Diaries, and have given it a Blade Runner-meets-Black Mirror style. Although the title robot calls itself Murderbot, it doesn't really want to kill anyone. It prefers sitting around bingeing its favourite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a series-within-the-series with John Cho and Jack McBrayer playing the leads. When it lands on a new planet, its social awkwardness creates a very human problem, which makes it, Skarsgård told Empire magazine, ""more relatable than most characters I've ever played"". Of course, he has played Tarzan and a vampire, so relatable is a relative thing. Murderbot premieres 16 May on Apple TV+ internationally Nicole Kidman and her collection of improbable wigs – see The Undoing or The Perfect Couple – are now television mainstays. In season two of this series based on a Liane Moriarty novel, she returns as psychedelic-dispensing wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko, still Russian-accented but now with a pin-straight bob instead of a waist-length mop of waves. She has also relocated her week-long retreat from sunny California to the snowy Austrian Alps, where another crop of troubled, privileged characters turn up – like The White Lotus but with a cult-like, possibly charlatan therapist. As Kidman told Vanity Fair about Masha, ""She morphs. She adapts."" New characters are played by another starry cast, including Henry Golding, Christine Baranski, Mark Strong, Lena Olin and Murray Bartlett. Let the wig-games begin. Vulture has even ranked them. Nine Perfect Strangers premieres 21 May on Hulu in the US and 22 May on Amazon Prime Video in the UK Julianne Moore and Meghann Fahy star in this dark comedy about power, class and control, set over one weekend on a wealthy resort island. Moore plays Michaela, a philanthropist and animal activist who is also iron-fisted in her control of island society. Her personal assistant, Simone (Milly Alcock, who played the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragons), is so in thrall to her that Simone's sister, Devon, (Fahy) comes to the island to stage an intervention. Kevin Bacon plays Michaela's billionaire husband, with Glenn Howerton and Bill Camp among the supporting cast. The series was created by Molly Smith Metzler, who also created the hit Netflix series Maid. She based Sirens on her 2011 play Elemeno Pea, and has said that the show has ""a Greek mythology vibe"", presumably because Michaela sends out such a siren's call to Simone. But details are scarce, so for all we know this siren, as in mythology, could turn out to be half bird. Fully human or not, Moore is always worth watching. Sirens premieres 22 May on Netflix internationally Matthew Goode stars in this crime thriller, the latest show from Scott Frank, the creator of terrific series including The Queen's Gambit and Monsieur Spade. The hero, Carl Morck (Goode), is an abrasive detective in Edinburgh whose partner has been paralyzed on the job, sending him into a tailspin and landing him a low-profile role as head of a new cold-case unit called Department Q. Headquartered in a basement, his unit of misfits is meant to be no more than a publicity move for the police – but as in Slow Horses, the band of outcasts is smarter than their prized colleagues. Frank based the show on a series of Danish novels and changed the setting to Edinburgh, where it was shot. Meanwhile, Morck has been made into an Englishman, a fish out of water whose ex-wife is Scottish, which accounts for his very bad attitude toward all Scots. The top-flight cast includes Kelly Macdonald and Shirley Henderson. Dept Q premieres 29 May on Netflix internationally An unlikely family tangle is beneath the plot of this thriller with Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks as estranged sisters who have very different lives. Biel plays Chloe, a polished media executive who lives in upscale comfort with her lawyer husband (Corey Stoll) and teenage son. Banks plays Nicky, a recovering addict who is struggling financially. When someone in the family is murdered, the death and their old sibling rivalry converge, as the sisters come together to find the truth of what happened. Lorraine Toussaint, Matthew Modine and Gloria Reuben are also in the cast. Olivia Milch, who co-created the show with Regina Corrado (based on a 2019 novel by Alafair Burke) told Glamour that the question of which sister is better ""changes moment to moment"", which sounds just right for a thriller. The Better Sister premieres 29 May on Prime Video internationally As she ambles into her next chapter in life, nearly 30 years after Sex and the City premiered, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) still has great shoes, as seen in the trailer for the third season of this sequel series. The new season puts her where the last one ended, in a new apartment and trying a long-distance relationship with Aiden (John Corbett). But Carrie is now writing a novel, instead of the personal column she used to write. As always, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) have their own issues. Sarita Choudhury and Nicole Ari Parker return as recently-acquired core friends Seema and Lisa, while Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone appear as brand new characters. The show has inspired long-loyal, opinionated fans, who will want to know whether or not two old favourites are missing: Che Diaz (Sarah Ramirez), Miranda's former partner who was a love-them or hate-them character, and Kim Cattrall, whose phoned-in cameo as Samantha last season – really, she was shown in a car on the phone for a minute – was a fizzle.

The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,'It was the cleverest escape in the prison's 30 years': The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240607-it-was-the-cleverest-escape-in-the-prisons-30-years-the-men-who-broke-out-of-alcatraz-with-a-spoon,"On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape – from what was the US's most secure prison – continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime. In May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made ""the most feared journey in the criminal world"" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed ""the Rock"", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped. Alcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". ""Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,"" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it. Four years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night. When the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. ""A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,"" he said. ""Built over the rambling passages of an old fort… the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up."" With Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-mâché grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood. But while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-mâché versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place.

Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it – carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower – shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered. The island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. ""When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,"" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. ""I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was."" The prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again. Although the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964."" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,"" he said. ""Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?"" Alcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: ""the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners"". Over the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves – unable to face the unrelenting conditions – and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment. As for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service. But speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them. In 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read ""I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!"" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not. The case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.

The Cold War spy mystery of the vanishing frogman,'He swam out to the Russian vessel and was never seen alive again': The Cold War spy mystery of the 'vanishing frogman',https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250501-the-cold-war-spy-mystery-of-buster-crabb,"In 1956, Royal Navy Commander ""Buster"" Crabb disappeared in murky circumstances during a visit to the UK by Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan read the newly declassified files that detailed Crabb's unofficial secret mission – and how the government tried to cover it up. It was on 9 May 1956, 68 years ago this week, that UK Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden finally succumbed to press pressure and international embarrassment, and ordered an enquiry into the mysterious disappearance of Royal Navy diver Commander Lionel ""Buster"" Crabb. The decorated frogman had vanished during a goodwill visit to the UK by the Soviet leadership at the height of Cold War tensions. When word leaked that Crabb had gone missing, The Admiralty, the government department responsible for the Navy, issued a vague statement that the diver had been testing underwater equipment at Stokes Bay on the Hampshire coast and was presumed drowned. But the story fell apart when the visiting Russians accused their hosts of espionage. The Soviets claimed that they had seen a frogman near the Ordzhonikidze – the ship that had brought the Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev to the UK – while it was docked in Portsmouth Harbour. Despite questions being asked repeatedly in Parliament, Eden refused to say more, claiming: ""It would not be in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which Commander Crabb is presumed to have met his death."" The government's stonewalling merely heightened suspicions that Crabb had been on a covert spy mission. Fourteen months after Crabb vanished, a headless, handless body in a diving suit was found by fishermen in Chichester Harbour on the south coast of England. Its lack of fingerprints and teeth made the mutilated body difficult to identify, but a later inquest ruled that it was Crabb. The whole episode publicly embarrassed Eden and wrecked his attempts to develop a more friendly relationship with a post-Stalin Soviet Union. When he disappeared in 1956, Crabb was well known for his daring underwater exploits. Nicknamed ""Buster"", after the US Olympic swimmer and actor Buster Crabbe, who had risen to fame in the 1930s, he was an expert in underwater bomb disposal. His bravery during World War Two had earned him the George Medal for removing Italian limpet mines from British warships at Malta, and an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his mine clearance work at Livorno in Italy. His wartime amphibious adventures would later be fictionalised in a 1958 film, The Silent Enemy, with Crabb being played by Laurence Harvey. And even after he was officially demobbed in 1947, he continued diving for the military in various capacities, including investigating sunken submarines. For decades following the frogman's disappearance, the UK government staunchly maintained its silence on the incident. It would only be from 2006 onwards, when due to Freedom of Information requests by the BBC, and classified documents being made public under the 50-year rule, that the murky circumstances of Crabb's ill-fated final dive began to emerge. The declassified files showed that, from the start, the UK's security services were keen to use the opportunity of Khruschev's visit to gather intelligence on their Cold War opponents. They suggested hiding microphones in Claridge's hotel, which the Soviet leadership intended to use as their headquarters during their stay. But the prime minister expressly ruled out the idea and made ""clear that adventures of a similar nature were forbidden"". Despite this, MI6 recruited Crabb to undertake an ""unofficial enterprise"" to investigate the Russian ship Ordzhonikidze. The exact nature of his mission is still unclear, but the ex-MI5 officer Peter Wright suggested in his book Spycatcher (1987) that it was to examine and photograph the ship's advanced propeller design. Two days before the mission, Crabb and another MI6 agent, who went by the name Bernard Smith, checked into the Sally Port hotel in Portsmouth. On the evening of 17 April 1956, Crabb met with a military colleague in a local pub. This colleague, whose name was deleted from the file, was a Royal Navy lieutenant commander who agreed to help Crabb get into Portsmouth Harbour for his final dive. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan got the chance to examine the previously classified sworn statement by ""the last man to see Crabb alive"". ""He says he was approached by the commander a couple of days before his final dive and asked 'if I would be prepared to assist him, entirely unofficially and in a strictly private capacity, in connection with a dive he was taking a day or two later'. He goes on to say under no account was this man to contact any responsible naval authority,"" said Buchanan. More like this: • The greatest sailing rescue ever made • A death-defying D-Day mission in a wooden glider • The US's most damaging double agent Just before 07:00 on 19 April, the unnamed lieutenant commander went with Crabb to Portsmouth Harbour, and helped him dress and check his equipment. Crabb then swam out to the Russian vessel, and was never seen alive again. The Royal Navy made no attempt to look for the missing frogman for fear of alerting the Ordzhonikidze's crew. ""The documents further reveal that no search and rescue efforts were made for Crabb as it was not a bonafide operation,"" said Buchanan. ""And they detailed the extensive efforts made by [the Admiralty] to ensure they weren't implicated in a botched mission they knew nothing about."" The intelligence services surmised that Crabb must have either been captured by the Soviets, been destroyed by Russian ""countermeasures"", or suffered a ""natural mishap"". Smith, the MI6 agent, removed Crabb's belongings and checked out of the Sally Port hotel. A few days later, the police removed the pages with their details from the Sally Port's register, which only served to fuel suspicions of a covert mission. Under pressure from MI6 and the government, the Admiralty hastily concocted the spurious story that Crabb had gone missing during a test in Stokes Bay. Records of meetings show the panic at the highest levels of government. Officials feared that if a body was found, the Soviets could use Crabb's death for propaganda purposes. National Archives' Howard Davis told the BBC in 2006 that the file ""makes it perfectly clear that this wasn't an Admiralty operation; they had nothing to do with it and we see them trying to construct a story that they can plausibly tell to face the inevitable questions from the press"". But despite the release of some of the government's classified documents, exactly what happened to the diver that day in 1956 is still unknown. In 1990, Joseph Zwerkin, a former Soviet naval intelligence agent, claimed that a Soviet sniper on the Ordzhonikidze's deck had spotted the diver in the water and shot him. In 2007, a 74-year-old former Russian frogman, Eduard Koltsov, claimed that he slashed Crabb's throat in an underwater fight after catching him attaching a mine to Ordzhonikidze. It has also been suggested that as Crabb was an associate of Sir Anthony Blunt, who was unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1979, he could even have defected. Nicholas Elliott, a former senior MI6 agent who was rumoured to be involved in Crabb's final dive, believed that the 47-year-old diver, who was known for his fondness for whiskey and cigarettes, had succumbed to oxygen poisoning or a heart attack as a result of his exertions while underwater. It may be some time before more details of Crabb's fate come to light. While some papers concerning the affair have been released into the public domain, others have had their classified status extended by the government and are not scheduled for release until 2057. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

"The long tradition of black dandyism, this year's Met Gala theme",'Clothes can contain a lot of emotion': How black men have used flamboyant fashion to express pride and resistance,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250502-how-black-men-have-used-bold-fashion-as-resistance,"This year's Costume Institute spring exhibition and Met Gala are honouring black ""dandy"" style, and the tradition of bold tailoring worn by black men that has made a statement. Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history. The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), ""arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed"". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities – in a context where the very concept of ""blackness"" was created by non-black oppressors. Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme ""Tailored for you"" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James. The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The ""superfine"" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to ""a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'"" – a reminder that how you dress can contain ""a lot of emotion"". Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. ""Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,"" Miller tells the BBC. ""It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised."" Dandyism was already laying its foundations. In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters – in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman. However, in the case of Julius Soubise – manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury – the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be. While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing – once again – boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman – complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles – in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with ""a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]"" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his ""master"" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England. Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of. In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them. The suit, explains Miller, is ""a historical throughline"" in the exhibition, which includes everything ""from livery garments… to tailcoats and different versions of it… to even track suiting"". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom. More like this: • Seven of the best Met Gala looks over the decades • Coachella looks from Lady Gaga to Sabrina Carpenter •The indigenous American supermodel bringing change When rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched ""Hammer pants"". Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as ""a dandy among dandies"", André Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. ""He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,"" writes Wintour. ""For André, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once."" For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Iké Udé, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. ""Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,"" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Udé, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. ""He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,"" explains Miller. ""It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit."" This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline ""designed by an immigrant"". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. ""He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,"" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, ""that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that"". Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. ""Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture."" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. ""It's very much related to a jazz riff,"" Miller adds. ""Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new…"" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025. The accompanying book by Monica L Miller is published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and distributed by Yale University Press. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The true story of the first-ever 'rock star' chef,The 'first celebrity chef': How 19th-Century cook Antonin Carême made extraordinary food fit for kings,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-how-19th-century-bad-boy-antonin-careme-made-food-rock-n-roll,"A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called ""King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"" – shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks. It's described as ""the story of the first celebrity chef"". The French language series Carême is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Carême, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today – giving birth to the very idea of the ""celebrity"" chef. Indeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Carême, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, ""he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,"" he tells the BBC. And Voisin's portrayal of Carême feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen – a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. The series is inspired by a biography of Carême and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a ""bookish innocent"" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Carême aged 25: ""He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater."" Kelly also describes Carême as ""ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic"" as a person – although the Carême on screen risks much for those he loves. Indeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Carême as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as ""the charm of fiction in the show"". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, ""He [Carême] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life… and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing."" What is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Carême's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University. ""He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,"" Freedman tells the BBC. ""He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Carême."" While some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience. Bourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid ""the usual period drama style"" in this story. ""I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Carême,"" he says. ""And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life."" Voisin says their idea of the chef was that he had ""a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me"". ""I love looking to the historical story of Carême, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society."" The historical Carême's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as ""the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"". He's often credited as a founder of French gastronomy and of Grande Cuisine (classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century). However, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman Guillaume Tirel, known as ""Taillevent"", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several restaurants still bear his name. Carême's status is, he says, ""a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs. ""So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant."" The young Carême's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Carême: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that the ""Reign of Terror"" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable pâtissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-Périgord, known as Talleyrand. Even if the real Carême didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now. ""We know that Carême worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Carême brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time."" Politics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, ""Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so"". The visuals directly link the food Carême cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Carême licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri. ""The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,"" Voisin says. ""Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection."" The link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Carême's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital ""had become the City of Light – and the capital of food"". The talk around the young Carême, he says, would have been ""of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris"". Carême's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says. ""I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,"" he tells the BBC. A French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. ""One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit."" The era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Carême's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from ""economic disaster"". ""Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,"" she says. ""That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Carême wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty."" A later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) – who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London – ""is really Carême's heir,"" Cooke says. ""Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,"" she explains. ""He was able to achieve Carême's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Carême could not, because Carême was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too."" (Carême did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.) The emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Carême Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour. In another nod to modernity, the young Carême in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's ""Showstopper"" category might trace its ancestry back to Carême's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France. But now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly ""celebrity"" chef ""My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adrià, who was at El Bulli, or René Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented."" There is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Carême – and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention. ""Although Carême's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,"" he says. ""I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together – food, love and politics."" Carême premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Thunderbolts* is 'the greatest Marvel in years' ★★★★☆,Thunderbolts* review: 'The greatest Marvel offering in years',https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-thunderbolts-film-review,"The latest in the superhero franchise ""is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun"", with a ""charismatic"" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber. Ever since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end. The Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called ""Infinity Saga"" – the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years. The key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods. There's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong – but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep. De Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better. One small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not. More like this: • A combat epic that 'does what film does best' • Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis' • Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' The underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts – and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes. At both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion – and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre. ★★★★☆ -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Why Sinners has become a box-office sensation,'It doesn't stick to the rules': The reason Sinners has become a true box-office sensation,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-the-reason-sinners-has-become-a-true-box-office-sensation,"After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises. In less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a ""rule-defying"" proposition that ""continues to defy all the odds"", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (£34m) against its opening $48m (£36m). ""Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,"" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be ""the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013"". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (£120m), against a $90m (£67m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner – just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that ""profitability remains a question mark"". Perhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film – but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves – which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: ""Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?"" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread. This unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material – or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station – but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as ""something to hide behind"". He wanted to make the most personal film he could – a ""love letter"" to a late uncle from Mississippi – and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions. More like this: • 10 of the best films of 2025 so far • The best films to watch in April • Warfare review: it 'does what film does best' In some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with ""must-see"" and ""must-talk-about"" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: ""I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo."" That could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.
