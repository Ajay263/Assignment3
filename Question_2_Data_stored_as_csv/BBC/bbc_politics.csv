"Trump appeasing Putin with pressure on Ukraine, Biden tells BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9mvemxrwo,"Trump appeasing Putin with pressure on Ukraine, Biden tells BBC","Joe Biden has told the BBC that pressure from the Trump administration on Ukraine to give up territory to Russia is ""modern-day appeasement"" in an exclusive interview, his first since leaving the White House. Speaking in Delaware on Monday, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin believed Ukraine was part of Russia and ""anybody that thinks he's going to stop"" if some territory is conceded as part of a peace deal ""is just foolish"". Biden, who spoke as Allied nations mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day this week, said he was concerned about US-Europe relations breaking down under President Donald Trump, which he said ""would change the modern history of the world"". In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Biden was challenged on his own record on Ukraine as well as his decision to end his 2024 re-election bid late in the race after a stumbling debate performance stoked concerns over his fitness and plunged the Democratic Party into crisis. Biden dropped out less than four months before the November election, and when pushed on whether he should have left sooner and allowed more time for a replacement to be chosen, he said: ""I don't think it would have mattered. We left at a time when we had a good candidate."" ""Things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away. And it was a hard decision,"" he said. ""I think it was the right decision. I think that… it was just a difficult decision."" Asked about the current administration's treatment of US allies, the former president condemned Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama Canal, to acquire Greenland and to make Canada the 51st state. ""What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are,"" he said. ""We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation."" On Ukraine, Biden was challenged on whether he gave enough support to Kyiv to ensure they could win the war as opposed to just resist Russia's full-scale invasion. During three years of fighting, his White House shifted its position on the use of US-supplied weapons and lifted some restrictions over time. ""We gave them everything they needed to provide for their independence, and we were prepared to respond, more aggressively, if Putin moved again,"" he said. Biden was also asked about comments from the Trump administration suggesting Kyiv must give up some territory in order to secure a peace deal that would put an end to fighting. US Vice-President JD Vance recently laid out the US vision for a peace plan in Ukraine, saying it would ""freeze the territorial lines... close to where they are today"". He said Ukraine and Russia ""are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own"". Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has echoed that message, saying a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is ""unrealistic"". ""It is modern-day appeasement,"" Biden said on Monday, a reference to the policy of former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who sought in the late 1930s to appease Adolf Hitler's demands in a failed attempt to avoid a catastrophic all-out war in Europe. He also expressed concern that ""Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America and the leadership of America"". The continent's leaders, he added, were ""wondering, well, what do I do now?... Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?"" Trump has said he expects Russia to keep the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, and last month he accused Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations when Zelensky rejected the suggestion. Reports suggest recent US proposals for a truce settlement not only include formal US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, but also de facto US recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas in Ukraine. The White House has not publicly confirmed the details. ""I have no favourites. I don't want to have any favourites. I want to have a deal done,"" Trump said last month when asked about recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea. ""Yes, of course, [the Ukrainians] are angry that they were invaded,"" VP Vance told Fox News last week. ""But are we going to continue to lose thousands and thousands of soldiers over a few miles of territory this or that way?"" The pressure to cede land is not just coming from Washington, with the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, telling the BBC last month that Ukraine may have to temporarily give up territory. Discussing Putin, Biden said: ""I just don't understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he's going to take significant portions of land that aren't his, that that's going to satisfy him. I don't quite understand."" He also said he feared some countries in the Nato alliance that border Russia may ""just say we've got to make an accommodation"" to Putin if Ukraine ultimately gives up land. Trump has long resisted continuing the level of US military support that Biden gave to Ukraine, arguing that his ultimate aim is to end the bloodshed. He has previously said Zelensky played Biden ""like a fiddle"". Tensions between the White House and the Ukrainian leader exploded into public view in February, when Trump and Vance berated Zelensky and demanded he show more gratitude for years of US support during an extraordinary televised meeting in the Oval Office. ""I found it sort of beneath America in the way that took place,"" Biden said of the meeting. Trump and his top officials have repeatedly criticised European countries for not spending enough on their own defence and relying too heavily on US support. The US is by some margin the largest single donor to Ukraine, but European countries combined have spent more money, according to the Kiel Institute, a German-based think tank tracking support for Kyiv. ""I don't understand how they fail to understand that there's strength in alliances,"" Biden said of the Trump administration on Monday. ""There's benefits... It saves us money overall."" When asked about President Trump's first 100 days in office, which has seen a whirlwind of executive actions as well as sweeping cuts to the size and spending of the federal government, Biden touted his own record and sought to draw a stark contrast between when he left office and now. ""Our economy was growing. We were moving in a direction where the stock market was way up. We were in a situation where we were expanding our influence around the world in a positive way, increasing trade"" he said of state of the country when he left the White House in January. Trump, meanwhile, says he is driving a needed overhaul of the world's relationship with the US, rebalancing trade, controlling illegal immigration and making government more efficient. He celebrated the 100-day milestone with a triumphant speech last week. What does Biden make of the start to Trump 2.0? ""I'll let history judge that,"" he said. ""I don't see anything that was triumphant.""

"Russian attack on Kyiv kills two, hours before Putin-announced ceasefire due to start",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cp3y8l7q747t,"Russian attack on Kyiv kills two, hours before Putin-announced ceasefire due to start","We've just had the first reaction from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Russia's overnight attacks. The Ukrainian leader calls for countries to exert more pressure on Russia after the deadly attacks on the capital. We'll bring you more of his comments in our next post. Venezuela's president touched down in Moscow early on Wednesday morning, not long after Ukrainian drone attacks forced airports to close. Nicholas Maduro is one of the high-profile guests attending the Victory Day parade - being held on Friday - which marks 80 years since the surrender of Nazi Germany. Its the third night in a row that Ukraine has targeted the Russian capital and the second night that those attacks have forced airport closures. Moscow regularly halts air traffic in areas where its air defence systems are operating. Ukraine's foreign minister has called for more pressure on Moscow following the overnight attacks on Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. ""Once again, Russian strikes on Kyiv. A loud night in Ukraine's capital,"" Andrii Sybiha says in a post on X. ""Putin responds with such brutal strikes to Ukraine's unconditional proposal for a 30-day or longer ceasefire. He makes a deliberate mockery of US peace efforts."" The foreign minister says commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of WW2 alongside Vladimir Putin is ""unacceptable"". As we've been reporting, a parade in Moscow on Friday will mark the victory of the Soviet Union and allies over Nazi Germany. A building damaged by overnight strikes on the edge of Kyiv Ex-US President Joe Biden has criticised Donald Trump's approach to Russia, in an exclusive interview with the BBC. ""It is modern-day appeasement,"" he tells the Today programme's Nick Robinson, when asked about Ukraine possibly giving up territory. Biden also gives his views on the Oval Office meeting between Trump and President Zelensky - and whether he should have stepped aside as a presidential candidate earlier. Watch below. Watch: Biden's first interview since leaving the White House Frank Gardner Security correspondent, reporting from Kyiv It was a noisy night here in the Ukrainian capital. Twenty-eight Russian drones and one ballistic missile were aimed at the city. Ukrainian air defence kicked in, but two people were killed. Russia’s proposed ceasefire is due to start at midnight Moscow time. We’ll see. More details now on the Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia, which has injured four people. Russia hit the southern Ukrainian city with dozens of drone strikes, Zaporizhzhia's regional head Ivan Fedorov says in a post on Telegram. Multiple houses and high-rise buildings were damaged, as well as critical infrastructure facilities, Fedorov adds. Rescuers carry a man who was trapped beneath a residential building hit by a Russian drone strike Russia says Ukraine launched a drone attack on Moscow overnight - days before foreign leaders gather in the capital for a World War Two parade. The attack forced Moscow to shut four major airports for a few hours - the second night in a row of such closures. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russian air defence units destroyed at least 14 drones. There were no casualties and Ukraine has not commented. Vladimir Putin is due to host a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the victory of the Soviet Union and allies over Nazi Germany. World leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, are arriving in the city today and tomorrow. Rehearsals for the parade are taking place in Moscow - the ""Z"" symbol is a sign of support for Russia's armed forces A drone exploding over Kyiv on Wednesday morning Russian drone and missile strikes have killed two people in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and injured at least six others - including four children - local officials say. Overnight strikes also injured four people in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian police say. On the other side of the border, Russia's air defence forces say they repelled 14 drones flying towards Moscow overnight. It is the third night in a row that Ukraine has targeted Moscow, and the second night in a row that airports in the capital have been forced to temporarily close. The attacks come hours before a three-day ceasefire - announced by Vladimir Putin - is due to begin. Putin says attacks will stop at midnight local time (22:00 BST) - although Ukraine has dismissed the truce as ""theatrical"". The ceasefire was called to mark Victory Day - on Friday, foreign leaders will gather in Moscow's Red Square for a massive parade that commemorates Nazi Germany's surrender in World War Two."
India launches air strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cwyneele13qt,India launches air strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir,"Mock security drills are being held across several Indian cities and towns on Wednesday. As we reported earlier, India's home ministry had asked officials to conduct these in almost 250 districts with the aim of assessing and enhancing ""civil defence mechanisms"". The mock drills aim to test India's readiness for emergency situations such as air raids, blackouts, and evacuations and were announced before the Indian air strikes on Pakistan. Here are some photos from different cities: National Disaster Response Force personnel take part in a civil defence mock drill in Varanasi town in Uttar Pradesh state Fire department officials demonstrate an exercise in Varanasi town National Cadet Corps members participate in a mock drill at a school in Kolkata city in West Bengal state A mock drill being conducted in Lucknow city in Uttar Pradesh state Tensions are rising after India launched air strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap: The story is moving fast. Stay with us as we bring you more updates. BBC Urdu correspondent Farhat Javed reports from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir where an Indian air strike damaged a mosque and some houses. Though many people had left the area last night, some residents have been able to return to assess the damage to their properties, locals told the BBC. A sense of fear and uncertainty remains as people try to make sense of what happened last night. Sense of fear and uncertainty after strikes: BBC reports from Muzaffarabad The toll from cross-border shelling on the Indian side has risen to 10, a top army official has confirmed to the BBC. All the deaths have been reported from Poonch district, which lies near the Line of Control (LoC) - the de-facto border between India and Pakistan. At least 32 people have been injured in the violence, which began after India launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir earlier today. As tensions escalate, Pakistan says it has summoned India's chargé d’affaires to complain about what it calls ""unprovoked"" Indian air strikes. ""These strikes resulted in deaths and injuries of several civilians, including women and children,"" a statement by Pakistan's foreign ministry said, adding that the Indian action ""constituted a clear violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty"". Islamabad says it has also warned Delhi that ""such reckless behaviour poses a serious threat to regional peace and stability"". Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri spoke at a press conference about India's strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. India blames Pakistan for the deadly Pahalgam attack which killed 26 people last month - a claim Pakistan denies. ""It was deemed essential that the perpetrators and planners of the 22 April attack be brought to justice,"" Mr Misri said. He added that India had intelligence that ""further attacks"" were ""impending"". ""There was thus a compulsion both to deter and to pre-empt,"" he said. There was intelligence of further attacks against India: Official Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry says 26 people have been killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and firing along the Line of Control - the de facto border between the countries. Pakistan had earlier put the number of dead at eight. At their briefing earlier today, an Indian army officer had said they had ""no reports of civilian casualties in Pakistan"". India launched air strikes on nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the early hours of Wednesday Aamir Peerzada Reporting from Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir A top official in Poonch district in Indian-administered Kashmir has told the BBC that at least seven people have been killed and around 32 others have been injured in cross-border shelling in Poonch district. Poonch lies near the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India and Pakistan. “The shelling has stopped as of now. We are on the ground assessing the situation,"" said Azhar Majid, sub-divisional magistrate of Poonch. An Indian army spokesperson had earlier confirmed three deaths in the region. (From left) Col Sofiya Qureshi, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh at the briefing in Delhi After Mr Misri's briefing, two Indian military officials - Colonel Sofiya Qureshi from the army and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh from the air force - gave details of the Indian operation. They also showed visuals of what they described as ""destroyed terror camps"". Some points from their briefing: Mr Misri spoke in some detail about the ""barbarity"" of last month's attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which he said was carried out by ""Pakistani and Pakistan-trained terrorists"". He did not share any evidence of this in the briefing. He blamed the attack on The Resistance Front (TRF), describing it as a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba, a group based in Pakistan that India has designated a terrorist organisation. Soon after the attack, a social media post appeared claiming to be speaking on behalf of the TRF, saying it was behind the killings. But the TRF later denied involvement saying someone with access to its social media account had wrongly claimed a role in the attack. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the Pahalgam attack and asked India to show any evidence it has. It hasn't responded to India's latest claims yet. Mr Misri said Indian intelligence's monitoring of ""Pakistan-based terrorist modules"" indicated that further attacks against India were impending. ""There was thus compulsion both to deter and to pre-empt [further attacks]."" He also reiterated that India's strikes in Pakistani territory were ""measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and responsible"". Vikram Misri Some updates from the briefing... Mr Misri said the attack was clearly driven by the ""objective of undermining the normalcy"" returning to Indian-administered Kashmir. It was designed to derail the mainstay of the local economy - tourism, he said. Last year, more than 22.5 million tourists visited Indian-administered Kashmir, Mr Misri added. India's media briefing on the strikes has started in the capital, Delhi. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri is currently speaking about the militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir and about Pakistan's alleged link to the attackers - an accusation Islamabad has denied. Stay with us as we bring you more from the briefing. Debris from an unidentified aircraft has been found in Pampore in Indian-administered Kashmir. There is no official confirmation yet on which aircraft has crashed or who it belongs to. Pakistan’s military claims it has shot down five Indian fighter jets but India has not commented on this yet. The BBC's Riyaz Masroor reports from the ground. Video by Shafat Farooq, BBC Urdu BBC reports from the crash site of unidentified aircraft Archana Shukla India business correspondent India's benchmark stock indexes opened lower on Wednesday after the military strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Sensex lost close to 800 points and the Nifty lost 150 points in pre-trade, though they recovered some losses in the first few minutes after markets opened. Sectoral indices trading in the red include media, consumer goods and pharma. Auto stocks and banks are, however, gaining in trade. Markets are also reacting to news from Tuesday evening of India clinching a trade deal with the UK that looks to boost trade amidst global tariff turmoil. Broader Asian markets were also trading in the green on Wednesday. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah has praised the country's armed forces in a post on X, saying he was proud of them. Operation Sindoor - India's name for its strikes on Pakistan - is the country's response to the ""brutal killing of our innocent brothers in Pahalgam"", he wrote. ""The Modi government is resolved to give a befitting response to any attack on India and its people. Bharat [India's name in the Hindi language] remains firmly committed to eradicating terrorism from its roots,"" he added. Pakistan military claims to have shot down five Indian fighter jets Pakistan has claimed that it has shot down five Indian aircraft. ""So far, I can confirm to you that five Indian aircraft - including three Rafale, one SU-30 and one MiG-29 - and one Heron drone have also been shot down,” Pakistan military spokesperson Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhary has said in a video shared by Reuters. India has not responded to the claims yet. Aamir Peerzada Reporting from Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir We are now getting more details about one of the three civilian deaths that have been confirmed in Indian-administered Kashmir after Pakistan retaliated to India's air strikes with shelling along the Line of Control - the de-facto border between the countries. Buava Singh, a resident of Poonch district located along the LoC, says a mortar shell struck his niece Ruby Kaur's house late in the night. ""She had just woken up to make tea for her husband, who hadn't been keeping well. The shell’s splinters hit her head, causing severe bleeding. We rushed her to a nearby hospital, but she was declared dead,” Singh says. Ruby Kaur's daughter was badly injured. Singh says that there were no community bunkers in the area, forcing residents to take shelter in their homes. ""We have never seen such heavy shelling so far,"" he adds. The Chinese foreign ministry has called India's military operation against Pakistan ""regrettable"". In response to a question on escalating tensions between the South Asian rivals, the foreign ministry spokesperson , external said they were ""concerned"" about the ongoing situation and asked both countries to ""remain calm, exercise restraint and refrain from taking actions that may further complicate the situation"". BBC Urdu Pakistan paramilitary soldiers inspect a collapsed building at a complex in Muridke after the strikes Muhammad Younis Shah, a resident of Muridke in Pakistan's Punjab province, tells the BBC that four missiles fired by India fell on an educational complex there. The first three missiles landed in quick succession while a fourth came after an interval of five-to-seven minutes, he said. The complex - with a school and a college, a hostel and a medical complex as well as a mosque - has been partially damaged. Shah says the complex also has a residential area where some families live. Rescue workers, fire brigade and policemen are present in the area which is gripped by fear and panic, he says. ""All the people have moved from here to a safer place,"" he adds. A view of the destroyed Bilal Mosque in Pakistan-administrated Kashmir after India's strikes Muhammad Waheed lives near the Bilal mosque in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. “I was fast asleep when the first explosion shook my house,” he told the BBC. “I ran out onto the road where people had already gathered. Before we could figure out what was happening, three more missiles were fired, causing widespread panic and chaos."" Waheed says dozens of people, including women, have been injured and taken to a nearby hospital. “I don’t understand why our local mosque was targeted,” Waheed says. “This was a normal neighbourhood mosque where we prayed five times a day. We never saw any suspicious activity around it. ""People are now fleeing their homes and the sense of uncertainty is very high."""
What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6868pdpw4o,What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir,"Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named ""Operation Sindoor"" - were part of a ""commitment"" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead ""accountable"". But Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as ""unprovoked"", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the ""heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished"". Pakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims. Pakistan's military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at least 26 people were killed and 46 injured. India, meanwhile, said at least seven civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir. Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan. It said these sites were ""terrorist infrastructure"" - places where attacks were ""planned and directed"". It emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its ""actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature"". According to Pakistan, three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of ""targeting terrorist camps"" is false. The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam. The 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men. It was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and sparked widespread anger in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country would hunt the suspects ""till the ends of the Earth"" and that those who planned and carried it out ""will be punished beyond their imagination"". However, India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it. But Indian police have alleged two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks. In the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019. Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947. The countries have fought two wars over it. But more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike. This was the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370 that gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status in 2019. Following the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists visiting the region. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control – the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases. In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight. Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various countries and diplomats around the world to stop the current situation escalating. Already, UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for ""maximum restraint"", while US President Donald Trump said he hoped the fighting ""ends very quickly""."
Cardinals from across the world gather in the Vatican to elect new pope,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn4we7prv4rt,Cardinals from across the world gather in the Vatican to elect new pope,"Technically, yes. But it is highly unlikely. The are no rules that forbid the Pope from being elected in the first vote, but it has not happened in centuries. That first ballot is very important though, as the election is a numbers game: a two-thirds majority is needed to elect a new pope so cardinals will have to concentrate on candidates with a certain level of support. The first - or first few - votes will indicate who could emerge as a potential candidate capable of creating enough consensus among the electing cardinals. If today's vote doesn't yield a new pope, cardinals will go back to guesthouse Casa Santa Marta for dinner. It is then, on the side-lines of the voting process, that conversations take place about whom to support. The Sistine Chapel From Thursday morning - if a new pope is not announced on Wednesday - cardinals will have breakfast from 06:30 (05:30 BST) ahead of Mass at 08:15 (07:15 BST), before two votes are scheduled. We're just getting the first images from the Vatican this morning, where cardinals are gathering to start the process of electing a new pope. The day is packed with rituals and ends with an evening prayer in the Sistine Chapel after a first, highly secretive, vote. The cardinals have gathered in Vatican City to choose the 267th pope. In the morning, cardinals will take part in a Mass in St Peter’s Basilica. Later, in the afternoon, the cardinals will walk in a procession along the Via delle Fondamenta to the Sistine Chapel. This is where the highly secretive voting process takes place, beneath the famous Renaissance frescoes. Later the world will witness the first smoke emerge from the Sistine Chapel chimney. If it is black then there will be more voting in the following days. White smoke, of course, means a new pope has been chosen. White smoke signals that a new pope has been chosen but if it's black the voting continues Cardinals from across the world are gathering in Rome to elect the next pontiff following the death of Pope Francis on Easter Monday. We don’t know how long this process will take — previous conclaves have lasted only a few days, though in earlier centuries disagreements sometimes caused the meetings to stretch on for months. Cardinals will take part in a Mass at St Peter's Basilica this morning and will later walk to the Sistine Chapel to cast their votes under Michelangelo's frescoes. Once they enter the chapel, they will have no communication with the outside world until a new pope is elected. Then we wait for smoke to emerge from the chapel’s chimney. If it's black, there will be more rounds of voting tomorrow. White smoke signals that a new pope has been chosen. We'll take you through the day and will later, of course, be on the look out for the first signs of smoke. So stick with us."
The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2de9d8dky0o,The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave,"The Vatican's Santa Marta guesthouse has 128 rooms. From 7 May, it will be filled with cardinals participating in the conclave to elect the next Pope. But one room in the guesthouse is still sealed with a red ribbon, as it has been since its occupant died there on Easter Monday. That suite will only be reopened when the new pope is chosen. The ribbon remains a tangible reminder of the man whose shoes the cardinals are looking to fill – but Pope Francis' presence looms large over this conclave in many profound ways. He spent 12 years in the role and appointed around 80% of the cardinals who will select his successor. He also looked to radically shake up the workings of the Catholic Church, moving its centre of gravity away from its hierarchy at the Vatican in the direction of the rank-and-file faithful all over the world, and focused on the poor and marginalised. My conversations with cardinals and those assessing the needs of the Church in the days leading to this papal election almost always end up looking at what is required through the prism of what Pope Francis did in the role. While in recent days there appears to have been a growing coalescence around the idea that Francis' work should be built on, some of his critics remain far from convinced. So might there be enough of them to sway the vote as the Church attempts to reconcile the different outlooks and realities it faces around the globe? During the two weeks that followed the Pope's death, the cardinals met almost daily at the Vatican for pre-conclave gatherings known as general congregations. While the conclave in the Sistine Chapel is limited to cardinals who haven't yet reached the age of 80 (133 will participate in this one), these preliminary meetings are open to all 252 cardinals. Each attendee was given up to five minutes to air their views, though we know that some took longer. It was during such a meeting ahead of the last conclave of 2013, in a speech lasting less than four minutes, that Pope Francis - then known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina - made an impact, talking of a need to connect with those in the far reaches of the Catholic world. As Pope, he made a conscious drive to appoint cardinals from such places. It is why this is the most diverse conclave there has ever been. For the first time Cape Verde, Haiti, South Sudan, Tonga, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda will be represented. That diversity has already made its mark: the pre-conclave meetings are said to have brought to the fore just how different the needs of the Church appear to be depending on where in the world they are viewed. In Europe, for example, a primary consideration for some might be finding ways to reinvigorate and make relevant the mission of the Church in the face of shrinking congregations, whereas elsewhere - in African or Asian countries - concerns may revolve around social issues, poverty and conflict resolution. A prospective pope is likely to be one who has at least shown recognition of those very different realities. The official titles that the new pope will inherit gives a sense of the breadth of the role: Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Sovereign of the State of Vatican City among them. While some relate to the deeply spiritual, the last of those titles suggests the need for a statesman too, given that the pope is leader of a country, albeit the world's smallest. ""Unlike your average state, the agenda of the Vatican is driven to an extent by where the pope reigning at the time puts their emphasis,"" says Chris Trott, British ambassador to the Holy See. ""On the face of it a very tiny state, [but it is] one that punches many, many times above its weight. ""And Pope Francis had 50 million followers on Twitter, so [it is] a very, very small state and an incredible global influencer."" Pope Francis chose to amplify this part of the role, becoming a powerful global spokesman on behalf of those on the margins, including the poor and victims of war. He also tried to play the role of peacemaker, though not everyone thought he was successful in that regard, in relation to China and Russia in particular. According to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic figure in England and Wales, this expansion of the role is one reason so many even outside the faith are invested in the outcome of the conclave. ""There is a sense that the Pope in the person of Pope Francis became a figure who addressed everybody in the world… religious people and even those who do not have a religious affiliation,"" he says. ""I'm more and more aware that it's not just Catholics who are interested in this."" For many voting cardinals, it is primarily issues within the Catholic Church that are under the spotlight, which brings about the question of the type of pope they want as a manager, and someone who runs the Church's administrative body and its ministries. While Pope Francis worked on improving the way the Church deals with the huge issues of sexual abuse and of financial corruption, it is his successor who will have to ensure that reforms are evenly applied across the Catholic world. Even supporters of Pope Francis' efforts to make changes to the way the Church relates to its rank-and-file believers, and the way he built bridges with those outside the faith, were sometimes left confused about how exactly he envisioned things should work. Pope Francis changed the tone on social issues through comments he made, talking openly about subjects ranging from climate change to financial transparency within the Vatican. But throughout his papacy, some were unclear about what he meant or how it would be applied. One mission he had was to take some of the power and decision-making away from the Vatican hierarchy and into the hands of rank-and-file Catholics. Over nearly four years, at great effort, he commissioned what was, in effect, a poll of many of the world's Catholics to find out what mattered to them. Lay people were invited to participate in the most recent bishop's conference where the results of the survey were discussed. The biggest issues raised related to greater roles for women in the running of the church and welcoming LGBT+ Catholics. But the meeting ended in some confusion, with little in the form of tangible steps forward and little clarity as to how lay people will help steer the future direction of the Church. So, there is a general keenness for greater clarity from the new pope. Throughout his pontificate, some vocal traditionalists opposed what they saw as Pope Francis straying from Church teaching and long-standing tradition. In the pre-conclave meetings of cardinals, a number of those over the age of 80 (who because of their age would not be involved in voting) took the opportunity to play their part. Most contributions remained secret, but one that was reported was that of 83-year-old Italian cardinal, Beniamino Stella. He criticised Pope Francis for ""imposing his own ideas"" by attempting to move Church governance away from the clergy. And yet during the homily, or religious speech, at Pope Francis' funeral, what appeared to resonate with the public in attendance – judging by the volume of the applause – was talk of the themes Francis chose to champion: the dignity of migrants, an end to war, and the environment. This applause would have been heard loud and clear by the rows of cardinals. In some senses, Pope Francis did have clarity in focusing on the Church being relevant to people in their daily lives and, indeed, their struggles. He was clear about connecting with the world outside the faith too. ""There is a sense that in the voice of the pope, there's a voice of something that is needed,"" says Cardinal Nichols. ""For some people it's a moral compass, for some people it's the sense of being accepted, for some people it's the insistence that we must look at things from the point of view of the poorest. ""That's a voice that has fallen silent and our task is to find someone who can carry that forward."" From the death of Pope Francis to the moment cardinals checked into the Santa Marta guesthouse and its overflow residences, there appeared to be a trend towards a desire for continuity of what Pope Francis had achieved. Though perhaps that vision of continuity is one that could bring along more of his sceptics, in a way that was pragmatic. The word ""unity"" has been talked of a lot, after a period where the divides between supporters and detractors of the Pope's vision could sometimes become ugly. But in the end, when they step into the Sistine Chapel, the holiest of voting chambers, for all the pragmatism they may have taken into consideration before they cast their ballot, they will be urged to let God and the Holy Spirit guide them.

US and China to start talks over trade war this week,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgrejkvmjo,US and China to start talks over trade war this week,"US and Chinese officials are set to start talks this week to try to deescalate a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. Mr Bessent said he looked forward to rebalancing the international economic system to better serve the interests of the US. ""My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,"" he said in an interview with Fox News. ""If the United States wants to resolve the issue through negotiations, it must face up to the serious negative impact of unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world,"" a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday morning. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. The report added that China is open to talks but reiterated that if the country decides to continue to fight this trade war – it will fight to the end. The trade war has triggered turmoil in financial markets and sent shockwaves across global trade. Two trade experts told the BBC that they were not particularly optimistic about the talks, at least in the initial phase. ""You have to start somewhere, so I'm not saying it isn't worthwhile. Just unlikely to be the launch event people are hoping to see,"" said Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation. ""We should expect to see a lot of back and forth, just like what happened last time in 2018,"" Henry Gao, Professor of Law at Singapore Management University and a former Chinese lawyer on the World Trade Organization secretariat said. ""I would expect the talks to drag on for several months or even more than a year"". Financial markets in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news as well as announcements by Chinese authorities of measures to support the economy. US stock futures were also higher. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date and are an indication of how markets will trade when they open. Investors are also waiting for the US central bank to make its latest announcement on interest rates on Wednesday afternoon.

"Carney tells Trump that Canada 'won't be for sale, ever'",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4gw18753o,"Carney tells Trump that Canada 'won't be for sale, ever'","Mark Carney has told Donald Trump that Canada ""is not for sale"" as the president raised the prospect of the country becoming the 51st US state while welcoming the prime minister to the White House. Carney won the election last month promising to ""stand up"" to Trump, who has imposed tariffs on some Canadian products and sometimes talks about annexing the country. The former central banker responded with a firm but measured tone after the president proposed a ""wonderful marriage"" of incorporating Canada into the US. Despite a strained relationship recently between the once-close neighbours, the two men also lavished praise on each other in what was a largely cordial Oval Office meeting. Trump has imposed general tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico and sector-specific import taxes on cars, some of which have been suspended pending negotiations. The US president, who accuses Canada of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl south, has levied similar duties on steel and aluminium. Tuesday's meeting was the first time the two had met since Carney won Canada's general election on 28 April, a victory many have credited to concerns in that country about Trump. But the two leaders began with warm words, with Trump describing Carney as ""a very talented person"". He also hailed his guest's election win as ""one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater than mine"". Carney said Trump was a ""transformational president"", with ""a relentless focus on the American worker, securing your border, and securing the world"" and said he had ""revitalised"" Nato. But friction arose when Trump again argued that Canada would be better off as part of the US. Carney came prepared with a carefully worded response. ""As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,"" he told property magnate Trump, likening Canada to the Oval Office itself and to Britain's Buckingham Palace. ""Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign in the last several months, it's not for sale. Won't be for sale, ever."" Trump replied: ""Never say never."" The US leader traced his own red line when a journalist in the Oval Office asked if Carney could say anything to persuade him to lift tariffs. ""No,"" he replied. ""It's just the way it is."" ""This was a very friendly conversation,"" he added. ""But we want to make our own cars."" Trump once again argued that the US was subsidising Canada's military and did not need Canadian goods such as aluminium and steel. He said he and Carney would discuss ""tough points"" at their meeting, but ""regardless of anything, we're going to be friends with Canada"". Trump also criticised his visitor's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, with whom he had an adversarial relationship. Still, he said the meeting with Carney was in stark contrast to another recent Oval Office ""blow-up"" - a reference to a disastrous visit from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in February. Notably, Trump also downplayed the prospect of trade deals, even though his administration has repeatedly pointed to the over 80 countries the White House says are hoping to negotiate as a sign of progress. ""Everyone says, 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?,"" Trump said. ""We don't have to sign deals, they have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market. We don't want a piece of their market."" Carney said that he ""pressed the case"" to Trump on lifting tariffs, and found him to be ""willing to have that negotiation"". ""I think that's the main thing. That doesn't presuppose the outcome of the negotiation,"" Carney added at a news conference at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC. ""There'll be zigs and zags. Difficult aspects to it. But the prospect is there."" Carney did not speculate on timing, saying only that both leaders and their teams would speak again in the coming weeks. Additionally, Carney said he again asked that Trump stopped calling for Canada to become a US state. He added that he believed it important to distinguish between ""wish and reality"". ""He's the president. He's his own person,"" Carney said. ""He understands that we're having a negotiation between sovereign nations."" During Canada's election campaign, Carney argued he was the leader who could fight Trump's ""betrayal"", as well as push back against US threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. In his victory speech, the Liberal leader went as far as to say that the formerly tight US-Canadian relationship was ""over"" and that Canadians must ""fundamentally re-imagine our economy"" in the Trump era. More than $760bn (£570bn) in goods flowed between Canada and the US last year. Canada is the US' second-largest individual trading partner after Mexico, and the largest export market for US goods.

"Jeremy Bowen: Netanyahu's plan for Gaza risks dividing Israel, killing Palestinians and horrifying world",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd020j97l79o,"Jeremy Bowen: Netanyahu's plan for Gaza risks dividing Israel, killing Palestinians and horrifying world","Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis that ""we are on the eve of an intense entry into Gaza."" Israel would, he said, capture territory and hold it: ""They will not enter and come out."" The new offensive is calculated, according to the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Brigadier-General Effie Defrin, to bring back the remaining hostages. After that, he told Israeli radio, ""comes the collapse of the Hamas regime, its defeat, its submission"". The offensive will not start, Israel says, until after Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar next week. Assuming Trump does not dissuade Israel from going ahead, Israel will need a military and political miracle to pull off the results described by Brig-Gen Defrin. It is more likely that the offensive will sharpen everything that makes the Gaza war so controversial. The war, starting with the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, has taken the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis to a point as dangerous as any in its long history. Prolonging the war divides Israelis, kills even more Palestinian civilians and horrifies millions around the world, including many who describe themselves as friends of Israel. While the IDF attacks Hamas in Gaza, the government's plan is that its soldiers will force some or all of the more than two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza into a small area in the ruins of the south. Humanitarian aid would be distributed, perhaps by contractors including American private security firms. The United Nations humanitarian agencies have said they will not cooperate, condemning the plan as a violation of the principles of humanitarian aid. They have also warned of starvation in Gaza caused by Israel's decision more than two months ago to block all humanitarian deliveries. Israel's blockade, which continues, has been widely condemned, not just by the UN and Arab countries. Now, Britain and the European Union both say they are against a new Israeli offensive. A fortnight ago, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany, all allies of Israel who regard Hamas as a terrorist group, warned that the ""intolerable"" blockade put Palestinian civilians, including one million children, at ""an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death"". The ministers also warned, implicitly, that their ally was violating international law. ""Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change"", they insisted. ""Israel is bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid."" Israel denies it violates international humanitarian law and the laws of war in Gaza. But at the same time its own ministers' words suggest otherwise. One of many examples: the defence minister Israel Katz has described the blockade as a ""main pressure lever"" against Hamas. That sounds like an admission that the blockade is a weapon, even though it starves civilians, which amounts to a war crime. Countries and organisations that believe Israel systematically violates its legal obligations, committing a series of war crimes, will scour any new offensive for more evidence. Extreme language used by ministers will have been noted by the South African lawyers arguing the case at the International Court of Justice alleging Israeli genocide in Gaza. Much of it has come from ultra-nationalists who prop up the Netanyahu government. They see the new offensive as another step towards expelling Palestinians from Gaza and replacing them with Jewish settlers. One of the most vocal extremists, Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister said that in six months Gaza would be ""totally destroyed"". Palestinians in the territory would be ""despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places"". ""Relocation"", the word used by Smotrich, will be seen both by his supporters and political enemies as another reference to ""transfer"", an idea discussed since the earliest days of Zionism to force Arabs out of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu's Israeli critics say prolonging the war with a new offensive instead of ending it with a ceasefire is about his own political survival, not Israel's safety or the return of its hostages. In the days after the 7 October attacks there were lines of cars hurriedly parked outside military bases as Israelis rushed to volunteer for reserve duty to fight Hamas. Now thousands of them (some estimates from the Israeli left are higher) are refusing to do any more reserve duty. They argue the prime minister is continuing the war because if he doesn't his hard right will bring down the government and bring on the day of reckoning for mistakes and miscalculations Netanyahu made that gave Hamas an opportunity to attack. Inside Israel, the sharpest criticism of the planned offensive has come from the families of the hostages who fear they have been abandoned by the government that claims to be rescuing them. Hamas still has 24 living hostages in the Gaza Strip, according to Israel, and is holding the bodies of another 35 of the 251 taken on 7 October. The Netanyahu government has claimed repeatedly that only as much military pressure as possible will get the survivors home and return the bodies of the dead to their families. In reality, the biggest releases of hostages have come during ceasefires. The last ceasefire deal, which Trump insisted Israel sign in the final days of the Biden administration, included a planned second phase which was supposed to lead to the release of all the hostages and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu's extremist allies told him they would bring down his government if he agreed to a second phase of the ceasefire. First, Israel blocked humanitarian aid to put pressure, it said, on Hamas to agree to a renegotiated deal that would give Israel the option of going back to war even after the hostages were released. When Hamas refused, Israel went on the offensive again with a massive air attack on the night of 18 March. Since then, Israel has put unrelenting pressure on Palestinians in Gaza. A new offensive will kill many more Palestinian civilians, deepen the misery of the survivors and bereaved inside Gaza and widen the toxic rifts within Israel. On its own, without a ceasefire deal, it is unlikely on past form to force Hamas to free the remaining hostages. The carnage inflicted by Israel inside Gaza has been a recruiting sergeant for Hamas and other armed groups, according to President Joe Biden's administration just before it left office in January of this year. It is worth repeating the words used by Biden's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in a speech in Washington on 14 January. ""We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,"" Blinken said. ""That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war."" When he spoke, Israel was claiming that it had killed around 18,000 Palestinian fighters inside Gaza. More have been killed since then, and many more civilians. Israel's massive onslaught broke the back of Hamas as a structured military organisation more than a year ago. Now Israel faces an insurgency, which history shows can go for as long as recruits are prepared to fight and die to beat their enemy."
Trump says US to stop attacking Houthis in Yemen as group has 'capitulated',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5yd08wy7o,Trump says US to stop attacking Houthis in Yemen as group has 'capitulated',"Donald Trump said the US would stop attacking the Houthis in Yemen because the group had ""capitulated"", as Oman confirmed a ""ceasefire"" had been reached with the Iran-backed group for it to stop targeting shipping in the Red Sea. ""[The Houthis] just don't want to fight, and we will honour that and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,"" he said, speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the White House. Shortly afterwards the Omani foreign minister posted that the deal meant neither side would target the other, ""ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping"". The Houthis have yet to comment. The US stepped up air strikes on the Houthis in March and the US military says it has struck 1,000 targets in Yemen since then. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said the Houthis would ""not be blowing up ships anymore"". ""The Houthis have announced that they are not, or they announced to us at least, that they don't want to fight anymore... but, more importantly, we will take their word. ""They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore and that's what the purpose of what we were doing... so that's just news we just found out about that."" Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi said his country had mediated efforts to achieve de-escalation. ""In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping"" he said. The Houthis began attacking shipping passing through the Red Sea in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, who have been under bombardment by the Israeli military since the Palestinian armed group Hamas attacked Israeli communities in October 2023. They have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks on commercial ships, sinking two vessels, seizing a third and killing four crew members. The attacks forced even major shipping companies to stop using the Red Sea - through which almost 15% of global seaborne trade usually passes - and to take a much longer route around southern Africa instead. US-led naval forces thwarted many Houthi attacks on shipping and former US president Joe Biden began US air strikes against the Houthis, which have intensified under Trump. Last month, the Houthis said at least 68 African migrants were killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in north-western Yemen. The Houthis have continued firing missiles towards Israel, with one missile landing near Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv on Sunday. On Tuesday Israel responded with a large-scale attack on Yemen's main international airport in the capital Sanaa, which left it ""completely destroyed"" according to an airport official quoted by AFP. Other Israeli strikes hit power facilities and a cement factory. On Monday Israel bombed port facilities in Hudaydah and another cement factory in the city."
"'Approach, are you there?' - Audio reveals moment air traffic radar goes dark",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2gr7994lo,"'Approach, are you there?' - Audio reveals moment air traffic radar goes dark","Newly-released audio reveals the moment air traffic controllers at one of New York's busiest airports lost communications with planes under their control - leaving one pilot asking, ""Approach, are you there?"". The pilot called out five separate times over a span of 30 seconds before the control tower was able to respond, the audio recorded by LiveATC.net reveals. The tense moments at Newark Liberty International Airport led to multiple employees going on trauma leave, contributing to hundreds of delayed flights. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that communications were lost for 30 seconds, and that no planes were in danger. A few others have estimated that contact was lost for up to 90 seconds. ""That's 90 seconds of a wholly filled-up sky of planes literally flying blind over one of America's busiest airports,"" said New York Senator Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. ""Thank God nothing happened, but we tempt fate if no changes are made."" The audio released on Tuesday by LiveATC.net is between an air traffic control tower in Philadelphia, and pilots flying in the area around one of New York's busiest travel hubs. ""Approach, are you there?"" one pilot arriving from New Orleans says, to no response. After five further attempts, over thirty seconds, the tower responds: ""I got you loud and clear."" At another point, the control tower tells a United Airlines pilot: ""I am gonna move you here because I just got told that the approach lost all the radars."" ""Three of their four radar screens went black and they have no frequencies."" The pilot is heard calmly responding: ""Alright, we're ready to move."" The incident on 28 April contributed to hundreds of delayed flights that continued into Tuesday. Secretary Duffy said the outage was ""a sign that we have a frail system in place, and it has to be fixed"". The Federal Aviation Administration also acknowledged in a statement that ""our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our work force"". Air traffic control operations at the airport in New Jersey have come under sustained criticism recently. Last week, United Airlines announced it was cancelling 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule because the airport ""cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there""."
Inside the conclave: A visual guide to how the next pope is chosen,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-904185ba-2600-4d37-9419-9204b4da5167,How the next Pope is chosen,N/A
Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxk40ndk1o,Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process,"Who will be the next pope? The decision will be made by 133 cardinals who begin meeting in conclave from 16:30 (14:30GMT) in the 15th Century Sistine Chapel. The cardinals, all under 80, will debate and then vote for their preferred candidate until a single name secures the support of two-thirds of them. Their choice could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics, and it is harder than ever to predict who it will be. With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, most are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective. For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively ""progressive"" or ""traditionalist"". Could the cardinals elect an African, an Asian or even an American pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration? Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis' potential successor. Nationality: Italian Age: 70 Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis – making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration. Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner. He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength. But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world, calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland ""a defeat for humanity"". Catholic watchdog organisation Bishop Accountability has accused Cardinal Parolin of ""suppression of abuse information"" being passed to secular authorities in his role as secretary of state. The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: ""He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal."" Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now. Nationality: Filipino Age: 67 Could the next pope come from Asia? Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience – meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law. The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals – which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle. He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the ""Asian Francis"" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope. He has opposed abortion rights, calling them ""a form of murder"" – a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia. But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its ""severe"" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling ""branded"", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect. The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected. Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: ""I treat it like a joke! It's funny."" Although he did raise concerns about President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war deaths, critics suggest he could have been far more vocal on the issue. Some, including Philippines-based whistleblower priest, Father Shay Cullen, have criticised Tagle's handling of abuse perpetrators. Nationality: American Age: 69 Could the papacy go to an American for the first time? Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role. Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops. He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there. Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese. Nationality: Ghanaian Age: 76 If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years. He has claimed not to want the job. ""I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,"" he told the BBC in 2013. Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because ""those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters"". He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II. Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting. A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence. Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana. In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence. In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised. Nationality: Congolese Age: 65 It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis. He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that ""unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil"". Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church. But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: ""Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity."" Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world. Nationality: Hungarian Age: 72 A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016. He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church. The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate. Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis' two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict. His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the ""illiberal democracy"" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking. Nationality: Maltese Age: 68 If cardinals are looking for a candidate who will advance one of Pope Francis' key goals – to place more power in the hands of rank-and-file Catholics – they may look to Cardinal Grech. Pope Francis made him secretary general of the Synod of Bishops in 2019. In that role Cardinal Grech became instrumental in helping set in motion the Pope's vision of feeding the opinions of individual believers around the world into the Church's governance. Like the Pope he worked closely with, Grech is known to have been on a journey in regards to the way he views social issues. He has changed his tone on homosexuality over the past decade, declaring that Francis' endorsement of same-sex civil unions was a ""storm in a teacup"". Nationality: Italian Age: 69 The Archbishop of Bologna grew up in Rome and soon became part of the Sant'Egidio Community, a charity that focuses on the poor and the marginalised. He helped mediate the end of Mozambique's 15-year civil war in 1990, and took part in further mediation efforts in Guatemala and Burundi. Made a cardinal in 2019, he was chosen by Pope Francis - ahead of his secretary of state Pietro Parolin - to act as envoy after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He travelled to Kyiv and Moscow and sought the release of 19,000 Ukrainian children taken to Russia. He wrote the introduction to a 2018 book that called on the Church to improve its relationship with LGBT Catholics. His closeness to Francis may ultimately count against him in the conclave. Nationality: American Age: 73 Born in Detroit as the eldest of 13 children, the Archbishop of Newark is well known and popular among cardinals. Although he is considered a staunch supporter of Francis' views on offering a more open and welcoming Church, he is seen as a unifying figure. He has in the past deplored political polarisation in the US, warning against divisions in the Church too. In recent years he has said the Church should welcome same-sex couples and said he does not see a ""compelling theological reason why the Pope couldn't name a woman cardinal"". Appointed by Pope Benedict as deputy head of the Vatican office that works with religious orders and their congregations, Tobin also led a religious congregation called the Redemptorists. He was named as archbishop in Indianapolis, before Francis made him cardinal. Nationality: Italian Age: 83 Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected. The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal. His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said ""death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something"". Francis' words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope. Nationality: German Age: 71 Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too. The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican. He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching. But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis. Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church. Nationality: Italian Age: 60 Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since. Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as ""the heart of the life of this world"". Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction. Nationality: Canadian Age: 80 Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013. For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy. As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances. Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests. He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that ""Christ is male, the Church is feminine"". Nationality: Guinean Age: 79 Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis' reformist leanings. The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea. He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites. While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals. Nationality: French Age: 66 Not since Gregory XI died in 1378 has there been a French pope. Although born under French colonial rule in Algeria, Aveline grew up in France's second city Marseille, where he later became archbishop. He has been outspoken on avoiding ""criminalisation of immigrants as the cause of all evil"", chiming very much with Francis' focus on migrants. Aveline also set up an Institute of Science and Theology of Religions in Marseille and promoted dialogue with Islam and Judaism. He has spoken out against one of Marseille's biggest problems, drug trafficking networks. Considered close to Francis, two years ago he brought the Pope to Marseille for a brief visit. Although he speaks Arabic, one potential drawback is that he does not speak fluent Italian. Nationality: Myanmar Age: 76 Another Asian cardinal with strong credentials for the papacy, Bo was brought up in a large family by his mother in a country where only 1.3% of the population are Catholics. Born in the northern Sagaing region, Cardinal Bo has seen for himself the conflict that has ravaged Myanmar. He led Asia's bishops for two terms and was considered close to Francis, who named him as Myanmar's first cardinal and became the first pope to visit the country in 2017. He spoke out over the plight of the Rohingya Muslims who were forced to flee the military in Rakhine state, and said Myanmar should celebrate its diversity. Nationality: Filipino Age: 66 Among the last cardinals appointed by Pope Francis in December 2024, David is widely known for his integrity and for speaking out against abuses during former President Rodrigo Duterte's deadly war on drugs in the Philippines. His actions led to death threats. Widely known as Cardinal Ambo, he was ordained as a priest aged 24 and became known for focusing on the poor, insisting on the Church's involvement in social issues. Francis made him bishop of Kalookan in 2015, and he was appointed by Asian bishops to head a commission for ""synodality"", which he said was Francis' biggest contribution, so that the Church would become ""more inclusive"" and less inward-looking. He attended the same Jesuit-led school as Luis Antonio Tagle in the late 1970s. Nationality: Canadian Age: 78 Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world. Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two. He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya. Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development. During the pre-conclave period he has warned against calls for ""unity"" from traditionalist cardinals, suggesting what they really mean is a ""reversal"" of reforms introduced by Pope Francis. Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession."

Joe Biden on Trump: 'What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89g491e8ewo,Joe Biden on Trump: 'What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are',"In an exclusive and remarkably candid interview - the first since he left office - Joe Biden discusses what he really thinks of his successor's first 100 days, plus his fears for the future if the Atlantic Alliance collapses It is hard to believe that the man I greet in the Delaware hotel where he launched his political career more than half a century ago was the ""leader of the free world"" little over 100 days ago. Joe Biden is still surrounded by all the trappings of power – the black SUVs, the security guys with curly earpieces, the sniffer dogs sent ahead to sweep the room for explosives. And yet he has spent the last three months watching much of what he believes in being swept away by his successor. Donald Trump has deployed the name Biden again and again - it is his political weapon of choice. One recent analysis showed that Trump said or wrote the name Biden at least 580 times in those first 100 days in office. Having claimed that rises in share prices were ""Trump's stock market"" at work, he later blamed sharp falls in share prices on ""Biden's stock market"". Until this week, President Biden himself (former presidents keep their titles after they leave office) has largely observed the convention that former presidents do not criticise their predecessors at the start of their time in office. But from the moment we shake hands it is clear that he is determined to have his say too. In a dark blue suit, the former president arrives smiling and relaxed but with the determined air of a man on a mission. It's his first interview since leaving the White House, and he seems most angry about Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies - in particular Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. ""I found it beneath America, the way that took place,"" he says of the explosive Oval Office row between Trump and Zelensky in February. ""And the way we talk about now that, 'it's the Gulf of America', 'maybe we're going to have to take back Panama', 'maybe we need to acquire Greenland, 'maybe Canada should be a [51st state].' What the hell's going on here? ""What President ever talks like that? That's not who we are. We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity - not about confiscation."" After just over 100 action-packed days of Trump there was no shortage of targets for President Biden to choose from. But his main concern appears to be on the international stage, rather than the domestic one: that is, the threat he believes now faces the alliance between the United States and Europe which, as he puts it, secured peace, freedom and democracy for eight decades. Just before our interview, which took place days before the 80th anniversary of VE Day, Biden took a large gold coin out of his pocket and pressed it into my hand. It was a souvenir of last year's D-Day commemoration. Biden believes that the speech he delivered on that beach in Normandy is one of his most important. In it, he declared that the men who fought and died ""knew – beyond any doubt – that there are things worth fighting and dying for"". I ask him whether he feels that message about sacrifice is in danger of being forgotten in America. Not by the people, he replies but, yes, by the leadership. It is, he says, a ""grave concern"" that the Atlantic Alliance is seen to be dying. ""I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs,"" he argues. ""We're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, [to] lead the world. Otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia, stepping up."" Now more than ever before that Alliance is being questioned. One leading former NATO figure told the BBC this week that the VE Day celebrations felt more like a funeral. President Trump has complained that the United States is being ""ripped off"" by her allies, Vice President JD Vance has said that America is ""bailing out"" Europe whilst Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted that Europe is ""free-loading"". Biden calls the pledge all members of Nato - the Atlantic Alliance - make ""to defend each and every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power"" a ""sacred obligation"". ""I fear that our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been for the last 80 years,"" Biden says. Under his presidency, both Finland and Sweden joined Nato - something he thinks made the alliance stronger. ""We did all that - and in four years we've got a guy who wants to walk away from it all. ""I'm worried that Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America, and the leadership of America in the world, to deal with not only Nato, but other matters that are of consequence."" I meet President Biden in the place he has called home since he was a boy, the city of Wilmington in Delaware. It is an hour and a half Amtrak train ride from Washington DC, a journey he has been making for 50 years since becoming a Senator at the age of just 30. He has spent more years in government than any other president. He was 82 when he left the Oval Office. His age has invited no end of scrutiny - an ""at times addled old man"" is how the journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson describe him in their book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. His calamitous live TV debate performance last June prompted further questions, as Biden stumbled over his words, lost his thread mid-sentence and boasted, somewhat bafflingly, that ""We finally beat Medicare!"". He withdrew from the election campaign soon after. Today, Biden is still warm and charismatic, with the folksy charm that made him an election winner but he is a much slower, quieter and more hesitant version of the leader he was once. Meeting with him in person, I found it hard to imagine he could have served for another four years in the White House, taking him closer to the age of 90. I ask Biden if he's now had to think again about his decisions last year. He pulled out of the presidential race just 107 days before election day, leaving Kamala Harris limited time to put together her own campaign. ""I don't think it would have mattered,"" he says. ""We left at a time when we had a good candidate, she was fully funded. ""What we had set out to do, no-one thought we could do,"" he continues. ""And we had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'No, I'm going to stop now'... It was a hard decision."" One he regrets? Surely withdrawing earlier could have given someone else a greater chance? ""No, I think it was the right decision."" He pauses. ""I think that… Well, it was just a difficult decision."" Biden says he went into politics to fight injustice and to this day has lost none of his appetite for the fight. Last year at the D-Day celebrations he warned: ""We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War Two."" Today, he expands on this: ""Look at the number of European leaders and European countries that are wondering, Well what do I do now? What's the best route for me to take? Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?"" ""Instead of democracy expanding around the world, [it's] receding. Democracy - every generation has to fight for it."" Speaking in Chicago recently, Biden declared that ""nobody's king"" in America. I asked him if he thinks President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than a constitutionally limited president. He chooses his reply carefully. ""He's not behaving like a Republican president,"" he says. Though later in our interview, Biden admits he's less worried about the future of US democracy than he used to be, ""because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about"". President Biden relished his role as the leading figure in Nato, deploying normally top secret intelligence to tell a sceptical world back in 2022 that Vladimir Putin was about to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine. Since taking office President Trump has charted a different course, telling Ukraine that it must consider giving up territory to Russia if it wants the war to end. ""It is modern day appeasement,"" Biden says of Trump's approach. Putin, he says, sees Ukraine as ""part of Mother Russia. He believes he has historical rights to Ukraine... He can't stand the fact that […] the Soviet Union has collapsed. And anybody who thinks he's going to stop is just foolish."" He fears that Trump's approach might signal to other European countries that it's time to give in to Russia. Yet Biden has faced accusations against him concerning the Ukraine War. Some in Kyiv and her allies, as well as some in the UK, claim that he gave President Zelensky just enough support to resist invasion but not enough to defeat Russia, perhaps out of fear that Putin would consider using nuclear weapons if cornered. When Putin was asked point blank on TV this week whether he would use nuclear weapons to win the war, he declared that he hoped that they would ""not be necessary,"" adding that he had the means to bring the war to what he called his ""logical conclusion"". I point out to Biden that it has been argued that he didn't have the courage to go all the way to give Ukraine the weapons it needed - to let Ukraine win. ""We gave them [Ukraine] everything they needed to provide for their independence,"" Biden argues. ""And we were prepared to respond more aggressively if in fact Putin moved again."" He says he was keen to avoid the prospect of ""World War Three, with nuclear powers,"" adding: ""And we did avoid it. ""What would Putin do if things got really tough for him?"" he continues. ""Threaten the use of tactical nuclear weapons. This is not a game or roulette."" Biden's belief in the Atlantic Alliance of the last living President born during World War Two is clearly undiminished. When he first arrived in the Oval Office, Biden hung a portrait of America's wartime leader Franklin D. Roosevelt on the wall. He was born two and a half years after the defeat of the Nazis into the world FDR helped to create - a world of American global leadership and solidarity. But the United States voted to reject Biden's policies and values and instead to endorse Donald Trump's call to put America First. The world is changing from what people like Joe Biden have taken for granted. ""Every generation has to fight to maintain democracy, every one,"" Biden says. ""Every one's going to be challenged. ""We've done it well for the last 80 years. And I'm worried there's the loss of understanding of the consequences of that."" This interview broadcasts on BBC Radio 4's Today on 7 May.
