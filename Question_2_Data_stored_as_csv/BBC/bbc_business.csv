US and China to start talks over trade war this week,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgrejkvmjo,US and China to start talks over trade war this week,"US and Chinese officials are set to start talks this week to try to deescalate a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks in Switzerland from 9 to 12 May, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer will represent Washington at the meeting, their offices announced. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods of up to 145%. Beijing has hit back with levies on some goods from the US of 125%. But global trade experts have told the BBC that they expect negotiations to take several months. It will be the first high-level interaction between the two countries since Chinese Vice-President Han Zheng attended Trump's inauguration in January. Mr Bessent said he looked forward to rebalancing the international economic system to better serve the interests of the US. ""My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,"" he said in an interview with Fox News. ""If the United States wants to resolve the issue through negotiations, it must face up to the serious negative impact of unilateral tariff measures on itself and the world,"" a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday morning. Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses. The report added that China is open to talks but reiterated that if the country decides to continue to fight this trade war – it will fight to the end. The trade war has triggered turmoil in financial markets and sent shockwaves across global trade. Two trade experts told the BBC that they were not particularly optimistic about the talks, at least in the initial phase. ""You have to start somewhere, so I'm not saying it isn't worthwhile. Just unlikely to be the launch event people are hoping to see,"" said Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation. ""We should expect to see a lot of back and forth, just like what happened last time in 2018,"" Henry Gao, Professor of Law at Singapore Management University and a former Chinese lawyer on the World Trade Organization secretariat said. ""I would expect the talks to drag on for several months or even more than a year"". Financial markets in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news as well as announcements by Chinese authorities of measures to support the economy. US stock futures were also higher. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date and are an indication of how markets will trade when they open. Investors are also waiting for the US central bank to make its latest announcement on interest rates on Wednesday afternoon.

UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y6y90e5vzo,UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks,

,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y6y90e5vzo,UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks,"The UK and India have agreed a trade deal that will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The British government said the ""landmark"" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and ""deliver for British people and business"". Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled £42.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was ""ambitious and mutually beneficial"". The pact would help ""catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies"", he said in a post on social media platform X. Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said. That includes lower tariffs on: The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: The British government said the deal was the ""biggest and most economically significant"" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were ""massive"". Tariffs on gin and whisky, a key sticking point in negotiations previously, will be halved to 75%, with further reductions taking effect in later years. Tariffs of 100% on more expensive UK-made cars exported to India will fall to 10%, subject to a quota limiting the total number. The deal also includes provisions on the services sector and procurement allowing British firms to compete for more contracts. Under the terms of the deal, some Indian and British workers will also gain from a three-year exemption from social security payments, which the Indian government called ""an unprecedented achievement"". The exemption applies to the staff of Indian companies temporarily transferred to the UK, and to UK firms' workers transferred to India. Social security contributions will be paid by employers and employees in their home country only, rather than in both places. The UK already has similar reciprocal ""double contribution convention"" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea, the government said. However, leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch described the agreement as ""two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir"", with Labour's increase in employer NI contributions from the Budget coming into force last month. Shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith said: ""Every time Labour negotiates, Britain loses"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it was ""very worrying to hear concerns that Indian workers coming over here, companies may not have to pay taxes on those workers"" and called for MPs to be allowed to vote on the deal. The government said the National Insurance exemption would not affect NHS funding, since Indians working in the UK would still be required to pay the immigration health surcharge. India, currently the fifth largest economy in the world, is forecast to become the third-largest within a few years, making it a desirable trading partner for the UK, currently the world's sixth largest economy. The UK is also a high priority trading partner for Prime Minister Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to increase exports by $1 trillion by 2030. The deal is a win for free trade at a time when US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff campaign has put the idea on the defensive and raised fears of tit-for-tat trade wars. It appears to have increased the impetus to strike this trade deal. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of business lobby group, the CBI, welcomed the deal saying it provided a ""beacon of hope amidst the spectre of protectionism"" following Trump's wave of tariffs. UK businesses saw ""myriad"" opportunities in the Indian market, she added. Allie Renison, from communications firm SEC Newgate, and a former government trade adviser, said the deal was potentially ""transformational"" due to India's size, growth rate and relatively high existing barriers to accessing its market."
Analysis: UK-India deal secured as Trump tariffs everywhere,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn919g2v3w2o,Faisal Islam: Trump tariffs may have helped drive UK-India trade deal,"It has long been the great prize for Britain's post-EU trade freedom - a deal with what is now the world's most populous country. India has agreed its most generous free trade agreement with the UK, which is at the same time Britain's biggest post-Brexit trade deal. It means a big boost for key UK exports such as whisky and cars which will see very high tariffs or taxes on imports slashed. This is not a normal deal taking two way trade down to zero tariffs. India is a highly protectionist economy. So, while 99% of tariffs on India's exports to the UK will be eradicated, 85% of British exports will not be tariffed going to India. But because British exports are so much higher value than Indian exports of clothing, footwear, and food, this should be worth £15bn extra for British exports and £10bn for India by 2040. This could change, though. For example, 88,000 cheaper Indian cars will now be able to be imported tariff free. The UK government sees this as a win-win which helps exporters, creates jobs, and means lower prices for consumers. This is all part of, in Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds words, making the UK the ""most connected market in the world"" - with a Brexit reset, a deal with the US, ""pragmatism"" on China, and new deals with India, and soon the Gulf. But there is also a much bigger picture here. This is the worlds fifth and sixth biggest economies doing a much closer deal to increase trade at a time when the top two - the US and China - are involved in a brutal trade war, and the Trump administration is tariffing everywhere. This may be one of the reasons why this elusive deal, coveted by many previous governments, has finally got over the line. It also turns the page on decades of missed economic opportunities, given the strong historic connections between the two nations."
EU plans to end Russian gas imports by end of 2027,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04547pr9vqo,EU plans to end Russian gas imports by end of 2027,"The European Commission has published a ""roadmap"" outlining its plans to end Europe's reliance on Russian energy in the coming years. Under the plans, imports of all Russian gas and liquefied natural gas to European Union member states will be banned by the end of 2027. ""No more will we permit Russia to weaponise energy against us... No more will we indirectly help fill up the [Kremlin's] war chests,"" European Commissioner for Energy Dan Jorgensen said in a news conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday. In response to the plans, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday that Europe was ""shooting itself in the foot"". The EU vowed to end its energy relations with Russia after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. A set of legislative proposals will be tabled in June asking all EU member states to make ""national plans"" to phase out Russian gas, nuclear fuel and oil imports, according to the European Commission. EU member states must submit strategies under the plans for replacing Russian oil imports by the end of 2027. Countries have also been asked to outline strategies for ending their reliance on Russia for uranium, enriched uranium and other nuclear materials. The EU hopes to move away from Russian gas by ""enhancing energy efficiency, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and diversifying supplies"", the European Commission said. While EU dependence on Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuels has decreased significantly since Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the bloc still imports a significant quantity of its energy from Russia. According to the report, EU gas imports from Russia have decreased from 45% in 2021 to 19% in 2024. The share of Russian oil imports has also shrunk from 27% at the beginning of 2022 to 3% now. Work must be done to reduce the bloc's reliance on Russian nuclear supplies, products and services, the report said, with more than 14% of uranium in the EU sourced from Russia in 2024. The EU's reliance on Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel poses ""risks to our economic security"" and financially supports Russia's war economy, the report said. ""We've come far, but not far enough,"" Jorgensen added in Tuesday's news conference, adding that measures to phase out Russian energy would be ""stepwise and gradual"" to minimise the impact on the EU. The roadmap also includes plans to target Russia's use of ""shadow fleets"" – oil tankers ""with obscure ownership and insurance"" that Russia uses to maintain its oil exports and bypass sanctions."
UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash in £2.9bn deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yr1nz7jwko,UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash in £2.9bn deal,"Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at £2.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. ""The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce,"" the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was ""very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business"". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was ""transformative"". ""The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition."" The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about £172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about £2bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some £8bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to ""squeeze out"" rivals such as Just Eat and ""rattle Uber"" in the UK. ""The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top,"" he added. ""With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast."""

Car giant Ford and Barbie maker Mattel warn over tariffs costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1e7ll07do,Car giant Ford and Barbie maker Mattel warn over tariffs costs,"Barbie maker Mattel says it will put up the prices of some of its toys in the US as President Donald Trump's tariffs increase its costs. The firm also says it will cut the number of products it makes in China for the American market. At the same time, car making giant Ford says the levies will cost it about $1.5bn (£1.13bn) this year. They join a growing list of big businesses warning about the impact of US tariffs on their companies and the wider economy. ""Given the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving US tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending, and Mattel's US sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season,"" Mattel said as it updated investors on its financial performance. The US accounts for about half of Mattel's global toy sales. It imports around 20% of its goods sold there from China. The company said it plans to reduce those Chinese imports to the US to below 15% by next year. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed new import taxes of up to 145% on goods from China. His administration said last month that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US. Apart from China, Mattel imports products – including Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars – from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The three countries were also hit with steep tariffs by Trump in April, before they were paused for 90 days. Last week, Trump acknowledged the potential impact of tariffs. American children might ""have two dolls instead of 30 dolls"", he said, but added that China would suffer more than the US. Carmaker Ford said it expected tariffs to add $2.5bn to its overall costs this year, mainly due to the increased expense of Mexican and Chinese imports. But the firm said it had cut about $1bn of those added costs by taking various measures, including transporting vehicles from Mexico to Canada to avoid US tariffs. The firm also suspended its annual earnings guidance to investors because of uncertainty around Trump's trade policies. In April, firms including technology giant Intel, footwear makers Adidas and Skechers, and consumer goods group Procter & Gamble detailed the impact of tariffs on their businesses. ""The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing,"" Intel's chief financial officer David Zinsner said during a call with investors. Sportswear giant Adidas warned tariffs would lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers, including the Gazelle and the Samba. The finance chief of footwear firm Skechers, David Weinberg, told investors: ""The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success."" And Procter & Gamble – which makes Ariel laundry detergent, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Gillette shaving products – said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places."
India worried about Chinese 'dumping' as trade tensions with Trump escalate,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg5d505v8xo,India worried about Chinese 'dumping' as trade tensions with Trump escalate,"The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down. The viscose yarn – a popular material that goes into making woven garments – he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month. That's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; £0.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports. With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets. India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs. While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps. Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition. ""We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,"" he says. Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are ""slowing production"". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed. China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers. ""We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,"" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper. But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals. While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India. Their sudden inflow will prove ""very disruptive"" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year. In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India. India, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (£75bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells. In response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn. India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down. Despite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. That's because the government has only had ""limited success"" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. While western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit. India's burgeoning deficit is a ""worrying story"", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters. ""This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,"" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. ""We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap."" India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura. Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being ""swamped by China"", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US. China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, ""It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny"". Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar. ""This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have."" Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook."
Colombia's wind farms bring promise and pain for indigenous group,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2ekjjgldo,Colombia's wind farms bring promise and pain for indigenous group,"When José Luis Iguarán steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea. The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguarán belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing. With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature. ""You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,"" Mr Iguarán says. His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more. ""At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,"" Mr Iguarán adds. The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family. Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguarán says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones. Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions. Mr Iguarán believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. ""The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,"" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela. His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption. ""Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,"" he adds. These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits. ""There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,"" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu. ""In Colombia… there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable."" In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renováveis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable. One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113. EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to ""constant protests"" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023. Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard. And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms. ""We call it the 'wind wars',"" says Ms Barney. For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies. ""There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,"" he says. This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects. ""For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected."" By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs. While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix. For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect. One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms. The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits. But it says good community relations are not enough. ""We cannot do these projects alone,"" says Federico Echavarría, general manager of AES Colombia. ""The government must help resolve conflicts between communities."" On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state. Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water. Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jagüeys – reservoirs filled with rainwater. His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit. Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. ""The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,"" he laments. The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term. While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."
Deported gang members get second chance at call centre,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g2e332d9o,Deported gang members get second chance at call centre,"When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby. Born in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old. Growing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life. After his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth. ""It was a shock. It still is,"" he admits. ""When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing."" Alberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. ""Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],"" he reflects. In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company – EZ Call Center – was looking for English-speakers. The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved. ""I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,"" he tells me during a break between calls. Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz. He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico. ""We are all dealing with culture shock,"" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls. ""We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too."" In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing. All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US. Daniel says that agents like Alberto – who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico – are among his most trusted employees. ""They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,"" he explains. Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions. As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation – called the Borderline Crisis Center – which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico. After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls ""the largest deportation in American history"". He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California. Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees. So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing. The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024. However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant ""encounters"" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years. The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors – from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador – may have acted as an effective deterrent. The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings. Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city. The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality. Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce. With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys. ""What happened in the US stays in the US,"" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. ""We don't really do background checks on that."" Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate. ""We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,"" she explains. The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start. He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old. ""Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,"" Luis explains. While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech. Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life. ""I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends."" For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with. ""From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,"" he adds. While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months. If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes. In Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line."
"Highly unlikely for tariffs to be ratcheted up, expert says",https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0l6j1mj/highly-unlikely-for-tariffs-to-be-ratcheted-up-expert-says,N/A,N/A
The ex-Google exec who wants to simplify your life,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20250313-the-ex-google-exec-who-wants-to-simplify-your-life,Why Marissa Mayer wants you to spend less time tapping your phone screen,"The former Google and Yahoo executive believes AI should simplify our lives but warns the real battle for the future will be determined by how the US and China embrace this technology. Marissa Mayer has spent her career at the centre of some of Silicon Valley's biggest moments. She was among Google's earliest employees and its first female engineer, helping to shape the search engine's user experience. She played a key role in many of the company's other now well-known products including maps and Gmail during her 13 years there. Later she would spend five-years as Yahoo's CEO and president, leading the company during a particularly challenging period. Throughout her career, Mayer has always been drawn to the intersection of technology and consumer experience. Recently, she's been tackling a new challenge at Sunshine, her AI-driven startup focused on making everyday tasks more seamless, starting with managing users' phone contacts and reminding them about birthdays. The company's latest AI-powered photo sharing app reflects Mayer's broader vision for how technology can enhance personal connections and interactions. ""I'm a techno-optimist,"" Mayer tells the BBC. ""I believe that AI, when applied thoughtfully, can free up time, strengthen relationships and ultimately bring more joy."" Over the years, Mayer has served on the boards of companies including Walmart and AT&T while also backing startups such as Minted and Square. In 2018, a year after resigning from Yahoo following the sale of its operating business to Verizon for $4.48bn (£3.6bn), Mayer co-founded Lumi Labs with former colleague Enrique Muñoz Torres, with the ambition of bringing AI to everyday consumer tasks. The company rebranded in 2020 as Sunshine after unveiling its first product, Sunshine Contacts, which aimed to use AI to rearrange smartphone users' contacts, delete duplicates and keep information up-to-date. Later it would launch Sunshine Birthdays, which promised to help avoid missing someone's birthday ever again by reminding users and allowing them to order gifts or cards within the app. The company has since pivoted to Shine: Photo Messaging, a free AI-powered app that claims to help users organise and share photos with facial recognition and automation. It's focused on recognising friends in photos and understanding who was together – whether for a BBQ, wedding or baseball game – by using contacts, location data and facial recognition to cluster images and automatically share them without the usual hassle. Still, like many AI-driven platforms, particularly those using facial recognition, the concept raises questions about data privacy and storage. (The company's website says it puts privacy first by requiring user consent before sharing photos but does store data and disclose certain information to third parties but does not sell it). Although she sees AI's potential to make people's lives easier, Mayer acknowledges there are challenges ahead, particularly when it comes to regulation, consumer trust, and ethical oversight of this emerging technology. Mayer spoke to the BBC about her vision for Sunshine, the evolving role of AI in daily life and what keeps her up at night. After spending years running Yahoo and parts of Google, how did you decide what you wanted to do next? I always wanted to be an entrepreneur and try founding something. I've always thought about how technology can bring people closer together and give people more time back. There were lots of things I loved about Google Search for the decade that I ran it, and one was giving people information and their time back because search was better, faster and more efficient. When I founded Sunshine, I really wanted to think about how we could make people's relationships stronger, and how people could spend less time on the screen tapping on things, and more time with each other doing things that are of higher value. What do you make of big tech's close relationship with President Donald Trump's administration? I'm by no means a political expert. So, I think that's an area I'm really remiss to comment on. I know overall I respect a lot of the players who are in the space and in that political dialogue on both sides. But I think it's really hard to say… particularly in the tech space where things are moving so quickly. Are you concerned about tariffs on trade and imports impacting your company? For example, a memo signed by President Donald Trump recently promised to impose tariffs on digital services from countries that placed burdensome regulations on US technology companies. I think eventually it may touch the company, but right now we're very focused on the US and English-speaking markets – and it's all digital goods. At the moment, I think the tariffs are unlikely to affect us. You've long been one of the more prominent female leaders in tech. How do you view the progress made for women in the industry? What are some of the biggest remaining challenges there? A lot has happened over the past 25 years of my career. I've been lucky to have been at places that are very empowering to women. That was true both at Google and Yahoo and it certainly is at Sunshine. It's also been true in my board work within those companies. I would like to see more women entering tech. It involves acquiring talent and retaining talent by having the right environment where they can be promoted and thrive. One of the things we identified early at Google was that, yes, there needs to be more women, but you also need to have an environment with men who are good at working with women. It's about selecting for an accepting environment. Silicon Valley has long been associated with a ""tech bro"" culture. How have you seen the culture evolve over time? At Google, we were so focused… that gender really did fade into the background. I didn't think about the fact that I was one of a few technical women there. In my leadership team at Yahoo, we had more than half women. Here at Sunshine, more than half of our engineers are women. I've always been in playing fields where I think women have been really respected and very much on equal footing, even if we weren't at equal numbers. From that perspective, I didn't necessarily have a hard time because I started my career at Google and was there for the first 13 years. A lot of strong women came out of that culture… including Jen Fitzpatrick [senior VP of core systems and experiences], who's very senior there now, and Sheryl Sandberg [former chief operating officer at Meta]. What did you learn during your time at Yahoo and Google that you're bringing over to Sunshine? So many things. I will say that focus on the product and a great user experience at the center of the design and development process has been part of all the companies I've been involved with. It's a very centering force. It's what really drives our ambition… and turns out superior technologies. You joined Yahoo at a time when it faced challenges in innovation and competition. What do you believe was your greatest accomplishment there? On the product side, I came to Yahoo to bring the company into the mobile era. When I arrived, we basically had no mobile products… and less than 30 global engineers in the company of 18,000. In fairness to Yahoo, it was 2012. I had really sold the board on the idea that much of what Yahoo had in its arsenal was stock, sports scores, news, weather, email and things that could thrive on the phone. But to do that, we had to build a mobile team. The first half of my time there – two and a half years – we had 600 mobile engineers. Apple identified us as the biggest iOS shop in the world. We won back-to-back app of the year awards – when Apple was only giving one a year – for Yahoo weather and Yahoo user Digest. We transformed that product suite and really brought it into the mobile era and ultimately started generating almost $2bn (£1.6bn). And part of that was the growth of mobile. So I'm really proud of what we accomplished in terms of the product offering and making it mobile first. How does Shine differentiate itself in a marketplace crowded with photo sharing services? For the first few years at Sunshine, we worked on contacts and built what I believe is a best-of-breed contacts app. We are really overall excited about it, but it is not viral. No one walks around saying, oh my gosh, my contact manager is so great. So this past year, we've pivoted and gone to something in the space that everyone else is more passionate about, and that's photos and events. But it's the same idea… how do you apply AI to everyday tasks? How can these technologies bring people closer together and give them time back? Tell us how Shine does that for photos. Right now, we're really focused on how we can help people share photos more efficiently by recognising your friends in photos and making it easier to share in small groups. If you're just going to share a photo person-to-person, you can text. If you want to share it with hundreds of people, there's always Instagram and Threads. But if you actually want to take a whole set of photos from [an experience] and then share it with anywhere from five to a few hundred people, that almost certainly involves cross-platforms between iOS and Android, which means neither Google Photos nor Apple Photos is really often the right solution for that group. It's often so much trouble that people just don't share the photos at all. So it's taking things like facial recognition, an understanding of your contacts and location and really trying to put together a whole picture of: who is this group, why were they together, and how would they want to share that photo. As an AI startup, do you worry about AI regulations? Partnerships between the government and thought leaders on both sides, both pessimists and optimists, are going to be absolutely critical. Even experts and people who are trying to stay apprised of everything, and really understand where things are and where they're going, have blind spots. It's very hard right now to keep up. I worry that sometimes we [in the US] get into a mindset that's very isolationist, thinking just about the US or the West. We don't necessarily think about the fact that there are a lot of AI technologies being developed elsewhere – in China in particular. They may have very different value systems than what we have. If we pump the brakes too hard with regulation and regulate this innovation, I don't think that same slowing will happen there. I think DeepSeek makes the point more obvious now. The real competition in terms of how AI is developed and adopted is between the US and China, not between any two companies. Inherent to the US-China AI competition is a tension between the common good and individual liberties, particularly in terms of how the AI is used. Which country is the leader in the AI space will fundamentally impact our global future. This isn't necessarily a values-based statement about which is better, but it raises questions like whether AI should prioritise public safety through large-scale surveillance or uphold strict privacy protections even at the risk of reduced oversight. Where do you think we'll be with AI in the next year or even five to 10 years? I'm incredibly optimistic about AI. I hope that it touches most of what we do. There's an adage that people tend to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term, and that's true generally in technology. I remember being five and watching the Jetsons and being like, wow, when I'm 30 they'll be flying cars. I'll be almost 50... and we're well past that mark and nowhere close to a safe flying car yet, but they are getting closer all the time. At the same time, when I was five, the internet didn't even exist. It has really transformed everything in terms of how we work, learn and navigate the world. AI is moving very fast. I wonder if this is going to be one of the first technologies that breaks that adage where it actually might surpass our expectations in the near term. I certainly think it's going to surpass our expectations in the longer term in terms of what it can do and what can happen. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."
Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp22d2kexo,Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms,"The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called ""Edinburgh Reforms"", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had ""no immediate"" plans to move, he and his company ""got a very warm welcome"" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract."
Trump considering 100% tariffs on movies not made in the US,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7e2z1rxyo,Trump considering 100% tariffs on movies not made in the US,"Donald Trump says he will talk to Hollywood executives, after his earlier announcement to hit films made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs sent shockwaves through the industry. The US president said on Sunday he was authorising the commerce department to start the process to impose the levy because America's film industry was dying ""a very fast death"". But he appeared to soften his stance later on Monday, telling reporters at the White House he was going to ""meet with the industry"" to ""make sure they're happy"" with his proposal. For years, filmmakers have been leaving Hollywood for destinations including the UK and Canada to lower costs. One non-US union said the tariff plan would be a ""knock-out blow"" to the international industry. Trump said on his Truth Social platform: ""It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!"" ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded to the announcement, saying ""We're on it"". But the details are unclear. Trump's statement did not say whether the tariff would apply to American production companies producing films abroad. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" Several recent major films produced by US studios were shot outside of America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. It was also unclear if the tariffs would apply to films on streaming services, such as Netflix, as well as those shown at cinemas, or how they would be calculated. The founder of European cinema chain Vue, Timothy Richards, questioned how Trump would define a US film. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""Is it where the money comes from? The script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?"" Mr Richards said the cost of filming in southern California had grown significantly over the last few decades, prompting filmmakers to move production to locations including the UK, which have increasingly offered tax incentives and lower costs. ""But it's not just the actual financing itself,"" he added. ""One of reasons UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly experienced and skilled film and production crew in the world. ""The devil will be in the details."" Meanwhile, UK media union Bectu warned the tariffs could ""deal a knock-out blow"" to the industry and its tens of thousands of freelancers, as it recovered from the pandemic and a ""recent slowdown"". Union chief Philippa Childs told the BBC: ""The government must move swiftly to defend this vital sector, and support the freelancers who power it, as a matter of essential national economic interest."" The UK government said it was ""absolutely committed"" to ensuring its film sector continued to thrive and create jobs, and would set out plans to do so in its upcoming Creative Industries Sector Plan. It added that talks on an economic deal with the US were ongoing but a ""running commentary"" on progress was ""not in the national interest"". The British Film Institute said it was working closely with the government and industry partners in the UK and the US ""while we understand the detail of the proposal"". ""We want to keep collaboration at the heart of our sectors, so we remain a constructive partner to our friends in the US and internationally,"" it said. The US remains a major film production hub globally despite challenges, according to movie industry research firm ProdPro. Its most recent annual report shows the country saw $14.54bn (£10.94bn) of production spending last year. Although that was down by 26% since 2022. And NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry. Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it ""harder for these films to make profits overseas"". ""It may create a situation where the tariffs in America are causing more harm than good,"" he added. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the five major US film studios, declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. Countries that have attracted an increase in spending since 2022 include Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, according to ProdPro. Following Trump's remarks, Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said: ""Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry."" Industry body Screen Producers Australia said that while there were ""many unknowns"" about the plan, there was ""no doubt it will send shock waves worldwide"". New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon also said his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs. ""But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,"" he told a news conference. Ahead of his inauguration, Trump appointed three film stars - Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone - to be special ambassadors tasked with promoting business opportunities in Hollywood, which he described as a ""great but very troubled place"". Trump wrote at the time: ""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK - BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!"" Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed tariffs on countries around the world. He argues tariffs - which are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries - will boost US manufacturers and protect jobs. But the global economy has been thrown into chaos as a result, and prices on goods around the world are expected to rise. Even before this most recent announcement, the US movie industry had been impacted by the fallout from Trump's trade policies. In April, China said it was reducing its quota of American films allowed into the country. ""The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favourability towards American films,"" the China Film Administration said. ""We will follow the market rules, respect the audience's choice, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.""

OpenAI says non-profit will remain in control after backlash,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy603eg0w8o,OpenAI says non-profit will remain in control after backlash,"OpenAI, the parent of artificial intelligence service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan after a bitter power struggle over the business. Boss Sam Altman said OpenAI would remain under the control of its non-profit board, while becoming what is known in the US as a public benefit corporation. Mr Altman had put forward a similar plan in December - but without clarifying the control of the non-profit. The update follows widespread scrutiny of the startup, which began as a non-profit and faced criticism, including from co-founder Elon Musk, that its quest for growth is pushing it to stray from its original mission of creating technology for the benefit of humanity. Last month, a group of former open AI staff and outside experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, wrote to regulators in California and Delaware, which have power over non-profits, asking them to intervene to block the conversion. OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the start-up made the decision ""after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California"". In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said the non-profit would continue to control OpenAI, receiving a ""big"", yet-to-be determined stake in OpenAI's business arm, which would give it access to money to put towards its own goals. He said the new plan would still allow the organisation to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits. That was seen as a sticking point for investors, including Microsoft, that hindered the firm's ability to raise money. ""We are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock,"" he wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the OpenAI website. ""This is not a sale, but a change of structure to something simpler."" Unlike traditional for-profit companies, which are bound to act in service to shareholders, a public benefit corporation is also responsible for a public mission. In the update on Monday, Mr Altman said he believed that growth and extending access to AI, which would take money, was consistent with the firm's mission, because it would help people ""build incredible things for each other and continue to drive society and quality of life forward"". ""It will of course not be all used for good, but we trust humanity and think the good will outweigh the bad by orders of magnitude,"" he wrote. It is not clear to what extent the new plan will satisfy investors or critics. After the announcement Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics adviser, who had spearheaded last month's letter, said the update did not resolve issues such as who would own the firm's technology and how its goals would be prioritised. ""We're glad that OpenAI is listening to concerns from civil society leaders ... but crucial questions remain,"" he said.

Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01kx3yrmvo,Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,"Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries. Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying ""a very fast death"". In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a ""calm and steady approach"" to talks in a bid to ""ease pressure on UK businesses"". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being ""jobless"" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a ""knock-out blow"". The UK film sector is worth £1.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October. Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed. White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit. ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said. Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is ""dominated"" by inward investment from US studios and that this ""brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK"". Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned ""against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe"" when the report came out. ""President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,"" she said. Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios. She urged ministers to ""urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way"". Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must ""get a grip"" to secure a trade deal with the US and ""protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success"". It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: ""The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means. ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot? ""Hollywood… has been in decline for some time,"" he said. ""A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia."" He added: ""One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world."" Bell concurred that ""the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places"" and lower costs. ""People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed."" She added: ""The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood."" According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20 percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (£248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive. A government spokesperson said on Monday: ""The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world. ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon. ""Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers."" Dozens of Hollywood blockbusters in recent years have actually seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, including:"
What impact might Trump's Hollywood tariffs plan have?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy04kjwk09o,What impact might Trump's Hollywood tariffs plan have?,"US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying ""a very fast death"". He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if ""they're happy"" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry. So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business, including the UK? Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was ""dying"". So is it? It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years. The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing. Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses. Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes. Then the wildfires struck earlier this year. And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content. The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far. The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season. But Hollywood is definitely still up against it. The president says he wants to ""immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!"" This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad. Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas. We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively. Trump later told reporters that ""other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States"", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that ""no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made"", and added that the administration is ""exploring all options"". We will have to wait for more detail. Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on. But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad. Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol? What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London? And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood. Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with. Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as ""grossly incompetent"" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually. While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: ""We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law."" There are more questions than answers at this stage. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods. And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing? Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?"" And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries? Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs. Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market. Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: ""Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real. ""Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way."" Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, ""was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK"". ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" she told PA. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries. ""Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,"" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said. New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs. ""But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,"" he added. And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights. Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made. More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale. NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry. Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it ""harder for these films to make profits overseas"". ""It may create a situation where the tariffs in America are causing more harm than good,"" he added."
Elon Musk's Starbase in Texas will officially become a city,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39j8rj4nmmo,Elon Musk's Starbase in Texas will officially become a city,"The area where Elon Musk's SpaceX company operates on the southern tip of Texas is to officially become a city called Starbase. Residents approved incorporating a patch of land as the new municipality in an election on Saturday. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote ""Starbase, Texas is now a real city!"" on his social media platform X. The new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012. The city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment. Since SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised. About 500 people are estimated to live nearby. The possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote. The first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. The BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment. Starbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League. A bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity. Currently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island. The result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year. The top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures. In recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics. The headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase. In contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers – most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities. Environmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. In 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (£113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water. The company has called the fines the result of ""disagreements over paperwork"" and maintains it follows environmental laws. The BBC approached SpaceX for comment."
