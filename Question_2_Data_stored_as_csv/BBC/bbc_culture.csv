Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g3ldd20vo,Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced,"The BBC has announced plans to make a Call the Midwife film as well as a prequel TV series set during the Second World War. It comes as filming begins for the 15th series of the BBC One drama, which follows a group of nurse midwives working in London's East End from the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will ""delve into the deeper past"", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The new, separate film and prequel projects will be written, created and produced by Thomas and executive producers Dame Pippa Harris and Ann Tricklebank, who will also oversee the production of series 16 of the programme together. The prequel series will feature ""some familiar (if much younger) faces"", Thomas said. She said that while she has ""never run out of stories for our midwives"", she had found herself ""yearning to delve into the deeper past"" than the years 1957 to 1971 which have been covered by the show. ""The Blitz years in the East End were extraordinary - filled with loss, togetherness, courage and joy,"" she said. Meanwhile, the film will see the ""much-loved"" regular characters ""take a short break from Poplar and test themselves in an unfamiliar landscape"", Ms Thomas said. The location of the film remains ""top secret"", she added - but said it would look ""absolutely fantastic"" on the big screen. The first series of the show was originally inspired by the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, who worked as a midwife and nurse in the community in Poplar. Dame Pippa said the prequel series and film project were being made partly for a ""new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face."" The 15th series will begin with a two-part Christmas special which will see characters travelling to Hong Kong on a mercy mission."

27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xvd10xv5o,27 of the best looks from Met Gala 2025,"Monday night marked one of the world's biggest nights of fashion, as stars served up their most iconic looks for the annual Met Gala in New York City. The theme for this year's event was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"", the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. It was inspired by a newly unveiled exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume institute featuring the ""black dandy"", which Vogue says ""examines the importance of clothing and style to the formation of black identities in the Atlantic diaspora"". A-list celebrities including Zendaya, Demi Moore and Diana Ross brought their own interpretation to the theme, stunning in tailored suits and dramatic gowns. Here is a look at some of the highlights: Actress Zendaya, known for her dazzling red carpet style, opted for a wide-brimmed hat and tailored Louis Vuitton cream suit at this year's Met Gala. But there was one slight pop of colour: her manicured red nails. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny wore a brown Prada suit, which he said he worked on with the Italian fashion house for a few months before the event. He also stayed on theme by accessorising with embellished gloves, a brooch and a hat that paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage. ""We did something special,"" he said of his look. ""I feel good, and I hope people think I'm looking good."" US reality TV star Kim Kardashian wore an all-black ensemble by LA-based brand Chrome Hearts - a fitted leather top and skirt that she offset with diamond necklaces and two strings of pearls. She is, of course, no stranger to the Met Gala - having made headlines with a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in 2022, and a wet-look Thierry Mugler dress in 2019. Black British designer Grace Wales Bonner dressed British Formula One star Sir Lewis Hamilton for the night. Sir Lewis was a co-chair of this year's event. The pair have worked together in the past with Wales Bonner dressing Hamilton for the 2023 British Fashion Awards. Singer Chappell Roan brought a rare pop of colour to the Met's blue carpet, in a patchwork hot pink ensemble sourced from eBay. The singer worked with Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell on her outfit, while make-up artist Pat McGrath was behind her disco-inspired look. Demi Moore gave us another round of method dressing. The American actress's recent press tour for The Substance recalled the body horror themes of the film, while her awards campaign for the role of Elisabeth Sparkle saw her dressing for the glam statuettes. Moore understood the assignment for the Met Gala, coming as a literal men's tie in a sculptural black and white striped sequin gown from Thom Browne. Rihanna, typically one of the most stylish attendees at the Gala, returned to the Met steps this year in Marc Jacobs, debuting her pregnancy with co-chair of the evening A$AP Rocky. Legendary singer Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble, complete with feathers and a long train that required at least two assistants. On the carpet, Ross said her son persuaded her to attend this year's event. The last time she attended the Met Gala is 2003. She added she had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered on her dress train. Actress Sydney Sweeney wore a custom Miu Miu gown - her third time wearing the designer at the Met Gala. This time, her dress was complete with beaded fringe shoulders and gold hardware detailing on the neck. Speaking about her look, Sweeney said it paid homage to actress and painter Kim Novak. Sweeney is set to portray Novak in the upcoming film Scandalous. A custom-made Chanel look was Dua Lipa's choice this year. The chiffon dress, sequin tweed jacket and organza cape - all adorned with pearls, feathers and crystals - took some 2,000 hours to make. Sabrina Carpenter wore a burgundy Louis Vuitton bodysuit that featured all the tailoring of a regular suit. The singer said she worked with recording artist Pharrell Williams - also the men's creative director of Louis Vuitton - on the bottomless look. ""You're quite short, so no pants for you,"" Carpenter recalled Williams telling her. Irish actor Barry Keoghan wore a custom-made Valentino fit, with florals embroidered on the cuffs and a silk red scarf wrapped around the waist. New Zealand singer Lorde made a rare appearance at the Met Gala this year (she has not attended since 2021). She wore a metallic silver floor-length skirt set, and a matching bandeau and blazer designed by Thom Browne. Olympic gymnast and gold medalist Simone Biles brought a pop of colour to the Met Gala carpet with a striking blue minidress that featured a collared neckline, a long train and jewelled appliques. The dress was designed by Harbison Studio. Singer Coco Jones opted for a look designed by Indian brand Manish Malhotra. She wore a tailored cream and white look that featured ornate embroidery and a dramatic long-sleeve coat. Jones also wore a large statement necklace and Jimmy Choo heels. Actor and playwright Colman Domingo could have inspired this year's Met Gala theme, as he's been carrying the baton for well-dressed men on the red carpet for several years now. He donned a royal blue Valentino cloak that paid homage to Andre Leon Talley, former editor-at-large on Vogue whom Anna Wintour called ""a dandy among dandies."" The cape later was removed to reveal a second look underneath: a tailored, patterned suit complete with a big fabric, polka-dotted flower brooch. Actress and singer Teyana Taylor, who hosted Vogue's live stream of the red carpet, arrived in custom Marc Jacobs on the arm of costume designer Ruth E. Carter. Ms Carter has worked with filmmaker Spike Lee and on the Black Panther movie franchise to create some modern pop cultural cues for the black dandy. Taylor wore a burgundy cape embroidered with ""Harlem Rose,"" a nod to her 2018 song A Rose in Harlem. Social media influencer Emma Chamberlain looked sharp and on theme with a backless tailored suit dress designed by French fashion house Courr√®ges. She accessorised the look with a spiky beach blonde pixie cut and stylish eyeglasses. Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, known for her on-theme style, wore a Givenchy ensemble featuring a bedazzled bodice and an extra-long black train with matching leather boots and nails. Recording artist Doja Cat wore a custom Marc Jacobs look that featured giant shoulder pads and a leopard-print bustier panel. ""I just wanted to feel like a little gangsta,"" she said. ""I feel like he brought that with the strong shape of the shoulders, and all of the exaggerated shapes,"" Doja Cat said of Jacobs. Actress Tracee Ellis Ross, the daughter of Diana Ross, was one of the few people who wore pink at this year's Met Gala. She donned a custom Marc Jacobs suit that was complete with a giant, hot pink bow at the back, a matching top hat and some unique bling. In one of the more memorable looks of the evening, Andre 3000 showed up to the Met Gala carpet with a black and white piano strapped to his back and a trash bag as a purse. The stylish OutKast rapper designed the look himself in collaboration with Burberry. Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o wore a stunning powder blue Chanel suit, with a matching hat and transparent cape. She accessorised the look with bedazzled, black rhinestone eyebrows. Rapper Cardi B debuted a new hairstyle (and eye colour) in a green Burberry pantsuit, complete with matching nails and eye shadow. Doechii took brand representation to new levels, stamping the famous Louis Vuitton logo on her face to go along with the motif of her suit. The American rapper is often seen wearing looks from the French fashion house. This outfit combined the designer's two famous patterns - the LV monogram pattern on the waistcoat and jacket, as well as the damier checkerboard on the shorts. When asked about her outfit on the carpet, Janelle Mon√°e responded simply - ""free"" - followed by an expletive. ""And when I'm in my suit, that is exactly how I feel,"" she said. She wore a Thom Brown suit, with whom she's attended the Met Gala as a guest for the last several years. The look is styled by the Academy Award-winning costume designer for Wicked, Paul Tazewell. Pop legend Madonna accessorised her cream-colored tuxedo with a cigar, creating an interplay between soft feminine materials and a distinct masculine energy. It's a dynamic that the superstar has played with throughout her career."
Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93g03g71qno,Home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant destroyed,"The home of Ukrainian Eurovision contestant Khrystyna Starykova has been destroyed by Russian shelling in the city of Myrnograd. The 19-year-old is currently in Switzerland rehearsing for her performance with the band Ziferblat, but posted photos of her damaged apartment block in the Sviltly neighbourhood. ""Home. And I dreamed so much of returning home,"" she captioned the post, which showed the building shrouded in smoke, with its windows blown out and several balconies collapsed. ""Fortunately, all my relatives and friends are alive and well,"" she said, and vowed to perform at Eurovision next week ""for the sake of our country"". ""[I want] to show what a strong people we are."" In an interview with Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne, Starykova said she had almost anticipated the destruction of her home. ""Four months ago, my grandmother lost her home - it was just such a big hole,"" she said. ""Then my aunt lost the roof over her head. ""I understood that maybe I could be the next one and, unfortunately, it happened. It's very terrible news. I had really hoped to go back."" The singer's home is less than five miles from the frontline, near the industrial city of Pokrovsk, a key battleground on Ukraine's eastern front. In a new Instagram post on Tuesday morning, she shared further footage of Myrnograd's bomb-damaged streets. ""I always went home from vocal lessons this way,"" she wrote in the caption. ""It was my favourite way home."" Ziferblat will represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest with Bird of Pray, a song telling the story of Ukrainians who have been separated from their loved ones by the war with Russia. ""It's about our problems we go through, the tragedy for the last three years,"" singer Valentyn Leshchynskyi told Eurovision fansite Wiwibloggs. ""To be honest, the last eleven years."" Starykova is a backing vocalist for the band, affectionately known as ""bird girl"" as she handles the song's high notes. She previously competed in the Ukrainian version of the TV talent show The Voice, reaching the grand final, where she performed a cover of Duncan Lawrence's Eurovision winner, Arcade. Born in Donetsk, she spent her childhood in Myrnograd, living through fierce battles between Russian-supported separatists and Ukrainian government forces in the region. ""When it all started, I was just in shock,"" she later told local news outlet The Eastern Variant, recalling the heavy shelling that hit Myrnograd in 2015. ""The whole sky lit up and we started running to hide in the corridor,"" she said. ""That was the first time I felt it all."" The family later moved to Kyiv, where Starykova studied at the renowned Gli√®re Music College - but she always intended to move back to her hometown. In a TV interview, she said it was important to go ahead with her Eurovision performance as a display of resilience. ""Despite what happened to me, I want to portray our song in a good way,"" she said. ""And just to convey our main message, that everything will be fine. ""Despite our troubles, we will survive. I'm holding on for us."""
Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2jjg10xlo,Oscar winner Vikander returns to stage after 17 years,"Actress Alicia Vikander is set to make her UK theatre debut in a new production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, producers have confirmed. It will mark the Oscar winner's first stage role of any kind for 17 years, following a successful run of film and TV performances. The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday. Vikander told BBC News she was ""thrilled"" to be returning to theatre, but added it was a ""daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult"". The play has been adapted and directed by Simon Stone, and will also star The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln. Speaking from her home in north London, Vikander recalled the influence the theatre had on her when she was younger. ""I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,"" she recalled. ""Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden. ""So I think that's what I always saw in front of me. And then, life happened, and throughout the years [theatre] has always been something I've been waiting for and thinking 'it will happen'."" Vikander has certainly been busy in the meantime. The 36-year-old has starred in Tomb Raider, Ex Machina and Testament of Youth, and won a best supporting actress Oscar for her performance opposite Eddie Redmayne in 2015's The Danish Girl. Vikander will play lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper. Ellida is married to a Norwegian doctor, but when a sailor she used to be engaged to suddenly returns, she is forced to choose between her current and former lover. The play marks the introduction of the character Hilde Wangel, one of the doctor's daughters from a previous marriage. Hilde goes on to appear in one of Ibsen's later plays, The Master Builder, a new adaptation of which is coincidentally also currently in the West End, starring Ewan McGregor. An adaptation of another Ibsen play, Enemy of the People, opened in London last year starring Doctor Who actor Matt Smith. Director Stone has previously helmed films such as The Dig and The Daughter, while his extensive theatre credits include productions of Yerma, Phaedra, Medea and Angels in America. ""He once again is going to take a classic and reinvent it and make it be something that is relatable to our modern audience today,"" Vikander said. ""And when I was told he was doing Ibsen and The Lady from the Sea, I guess that going back to my Scandinavian and Swedish heritage, it kind of felt like a perfect match."" Vikander said she felt the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today. ""I have discussions with my friends, I just passed 35, I'm getting close to my 40s soon and I have my kids, but I still feel extremely young. Really young. Sometimes I'm like, 'I'm 25 still!' ""But then I also realise I'm entering this very new chapter which is really exciting, but I think if you are in a place where you feel like you haven't fulfilled certain dreams or tried things, you're still wondering where these choices or action would have led you, then I think it's extremely human thing. ""Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother. ""So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories."" She aded: ""It's incredible that the big universal questions are something we're still battling in the same way."" Vikander said she was ""super excited and wonderfully nervous"" to begin the workshopping process with Stone in the coming weeks, out of which he will begin to produce the final script. As the show is still being developed, it has not yet been confirmed what the setting will be for this production. Another UK adaptation of The Lady from the Sea performed in 2017 at the Donmar Theatre moved the story to the Caribbean in the 1950s. The new adaptation is billed as her UK stage debut, but Vikander notes it's actually her first theatre of any kind since she was 19. ""I did theatre for my teens for a lot of years, like a child actor, and then the last thing I did was when I was a dancer for the Stockholm Opera House,"" she explained. ""I grew up watching my mother doing theatre, and I 'd always watch from afar, and I can't wait to try and do it myself. ""It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited."""
Vardy must pay ¬£1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7939wwxd0jo,Vardy must pay ¬£1.4m of Rooney's 'Wagatha' legal costs,"Rebekah Vardy must pay more than ¬£1.4m of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their libel battle, a judge has said. Mrs Rooney ran up a legal bill totalling more than ¬£1.8m while successfully defending herself against Mrs Vardy's High Court claim in 2022. After Mrs Vardy lost the case, court documents showed she had been ordered to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's costs. Earlier on Tuesday, a specialist costs court was told that Mrs Vardy had agreed to pay ¬£1.19m to Mrs Rooney, who was also asking for a further ¬£315,000 in ""assessment costs"". Costs judge Mark Whalan then said it was ""reasonable and proportionate"" for Mrs Vardy to pay her an additional ¬£212,266. This took the total to just over ¬£1.4m, including interest. He said he was ""generally happy"" that the outcome represented a ""commercially satisfactory conclusion for both sides"", but noted there had been ""extraordinary expenditure of costs"" by the parties. ""I do mean it when I say that I hope that this is the end of a long and unhappy road."" Mrs Rooney is the wife of ex-England footballer Wayne Rooney, while Mrs Vardy is married to his former team-mate Jamie Vardy. Both women are now celebrities and TV personalities in their own right. Neither attended the remote hearing, with Judge Whalan declaring they ""can both part to put this matter behind them"". Mrs Vardy's barrister, Juliet Wells, had argued that Mrs Rooney was claiming ""grossly disproportionate"" costs, recommending they were capped at ""no more than ¬£100,000"". In written submissions, Ms Wells said Mrs Rooney's original ¬£1.8m legal bill was ""substandard"" and included costs ""of briefing the press"" and others to which she had ""no entitlement"". But lawyers for Mrs Rooney said in their written submissions that Mrs Vardy was ""the author of her own misfortune"" and that she should ""reflect upon her approach""."
Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde21wnlrpjo,Rihanna reveals she is expecting third child with A$AP Rocky,"Singer Rihanna has confirmed she is expecting her third baby while attending fashion's biggest night of the year, the Met Gala in New York. The 37-year-old cradled her bump and smiled for the cameras while appearing on the red carpet, which was navy with daffodils. Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, and her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, already have two sons. A$AP Rocky, also known as Rakim Mayers, thanked reporters who offered their congratulations on the red carpet. ""It is time to just show the people what we were cooking up,"" he said. Rihanna was the last to arrive at the benefit event for New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which marks the opening of its Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit. Each year celebrities wear extravagant outfits in line with the event's theme. This year's concept was ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,"" the first since 2003 to focus exclusively on menswear. A$AP Rocky, a co-chair of the event, confirmed the couple's pregnancy news on the red carpet. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" the rapper said. ""I'm glad everybody's happy for us because we're definitely happy"", he added. The couple's first son RZA was born in May 2022 and their second son, Riot, was born in August 2023. The pop star and businesswoman is known for her high-profile pregnancy announcements. She debuted the pregnancy of her first child with a photoshoot with her partner in Harlem, New York City in 2022. When she performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 she revealed she was expecting their second child. She's not the first star to reveal their baby bump at the Met Gala - the former tennis player, Serena Williams and model Karlie Kloss both publicly revealed their pregnancies at the 2023 event."
Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01kx3yrmvo,Trump film tariffs to be part of UK-US trade talks,"Film tariffs are set to form part of trade negotiations between the UK and US after Donald Trump threatened to apply a 100% charge against movies made in foreign countries. Trump said in an announcement overnight that he would apply tariffs to foreign-made films to help America's movie industry, which he said was dying ""a very fast death"". In response, the UK government said trade negotiations with Washington were ongoing and it was taking a ""calm and steady approach"" to talks in a bid to ""ease pressure on UK businesses"". UK filmmakers warned freelancers in the industry risked being ""jobless"" if US productions were pulled, with one union saying the tariffs could be a ""knock-out blow"". The UK film sector is worth ¬£1.36 billion and employs more than 195,000 people, the government said in October. Much of the detail of the new tariff has yet to be confirmed. White House spokesman Kush Desai said later on Monday: ""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again."" But there is worry that UK film companies, which often produce movies with US firms - including recent blockbusters like Barbie and Wicked - could be badly hit. ""If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,"" Kirsty Bell, chief executive of UK production company Goldfinch, said. Philippa Childs, head of media and entertainment trade union, Bectu, echoed those fears: ""These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK."" A parliamentary committee's report published last month noted the UK's film and high-end television industry is ""dominated"" by inward investment from US studios and that this ""brings significant economic and social benefits to the UK"". Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) chairwoman Dame Caroline Dinenage said on Monday that MPs had warned ""against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe"" when the report came out. ""President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real,"" she said. Dame Caroline argued that making it more difficult to produce films in the UK was not in the interests of American businesses, many of which have invested in UK facilities, such as sound stages and studios. She urged ministers to ""urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way"". Shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew said Labour must ""get a grip"" to secure a trade deal with the US and ""protect the UK film industry, otherwise we risk seeing long-term damage to a sector that is a global success"". It is still not entirely clear whether Trump's plans will affect only British films exported to the US or if it will also have an impact on co-productions, as referenced by Bell and others. The uncertainty itself is worrying for many. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Tim Richards, CEO and founder of Vue Entertainment, said: ""The devil will be in the details and we need to parcel through exactly what [Trump] means. ""A big part of this is what constitutes US film, is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot? ""Hollywood‚Ä¶ has been in decline for some time,"" he said. ""A lot of films are being shot in other states and in other markets, principally Canada, the UK and Australia."" He added: ""One of the reasons the UK has done so well is we have some of the most highly skilled and experienced filmmakers and production crews in the world."" Bell concurred that ""the issue isn't that foreign films are taking precedence over domestic films, it's that, firstly, films are cheaper to make overseas, because of lack of tax credits in certain places"" and lower costs. ""People aren't going to the cinema as much and decline in subscription services and rise of social media platforms and content creators... the industry is entirely changed."" She added: ""The answer is not tariffs if [Trump is] trying to kick-start the industry in Hollywood."" According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Californian film commission offers a 20 percent base credit to feature films and TV series - lower than most other US states and countries like the UK and has a $330m (¬£248m) cap on the programme, which can make countries like the UK more attractive. A government spokesperson said on Monday: ""The film sector is a key part of the UK's world-class creative industries, which employ millions of people, generate billions for our economy and showcase the best of our creativity and culture to the world. ""We are absolutely committed to ensuring these sectors can continue to thrive and create good jobs right across the country, and will set this out through a new Creative Industries Sector Plan to be published soon. ""Talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK are ongoing - but we are not going to provide a running commentary on the details of live discussions or set any timelines because it is not in the national interest. We will continue to take a calm and steady approach to talks and aim to find a resolution to help ease the pressure on UK businesses and consumers."" Dozens of Hollywood blockbusters in recent years have actually seen the majority of their filming - known as principal photography - in the UK, including:"
12 of the best films to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250423-12-of-the-best-films-to-watch-in-may,Thunderbolts* to Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning: 12 of the best films to watch this May,"The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream. Cobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance ‚Äì and as Mr Miyagi once explained, ""Balance is key"". ""Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film ‚Äì even though they're separate ecosystems ‚Äì it all made sense for me,"" Macchio said in Variety. ""Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?"" Released on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally Danny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family. ""We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,"" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. ""They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me."" Released on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally The co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells ""the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of"". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed ‚Äì and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is ""a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive"", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com. Released on 16 May on Apple+ internationally There were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. ""Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,"" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. ""Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed."" Well‚Ä¶ maybe. Released on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally In 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri ‚Äì and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a ""shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre"". Fans of the first film will ""cherish this divinely twisted thriller"". Released on 1 May on Prime Video internationally Tim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian ""breaks up"" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is ""feverishly and hilariously demented"", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. ""Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year."" Released on 9 May in the US Admittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures ‚Äì so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial. Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally Nicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is ""a gloriously demented B-movie thriller"", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks ""the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic"". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. ""Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,"" says Brooks, ""The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe."" Released on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia Jane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen herself? ""The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,"" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots. Released on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK The original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 ‚Äì and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. ""You gotta see the movie,"" he told Empire magazine. ""It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience."" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word ""Final"" is in there for a reason. ""It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,"" he says. ""I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate."" Released on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally It seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles ‚Äì and enviable kitchens ‚Äì of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far? Released on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW ""After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,"" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, ""a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top."" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. ""It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,"" says Marric. ""It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.""

10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-10-of-the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-this-may,The Four Seasons to And Just Like That‚Ä¶: 10 of the best TV shows to watch this May,"From Tina Fey's new relationship comedy to an action drama from the creator of Lost, and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker and co in the third season of the Sex and the City sequel. Tine Fey stars in and co-created this comedy about three couples, long-time friends with enough disposable income to vacation together four times a year through different seasons. As in the 1981 film it is based on, everyone is rattled when one pair heads for divorce. Fey and Will Forte play one of the couples. Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani are another, a same-sex twist that is the most obvious update from '81. And Steve Carell plays a man who is leaving his wife (Kerri Kenney-Silver) for a younger woman (Erika Henningsen), a timeless part of the plot. Fey has called the show ""a love letter to long-term relationships, both platonic and romantic"", adding, ""I hope audiences feel like they are inside a big sweater with us, and also having a dinner party with us."" So if you like dinner parties in chunky sweaters, this is the show for you. The Four Seasons premieres 1 May on Netflix internationally Star Natasha Lyonne and creator Rian Johnson (Knives Out) have brought their popular homage to the classic Peter Falk series Columbo, and 1970s television in general, back for a second season. Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who has an incredible knack for running across murders, scoping out who's telling the truth and who's lying, and solving the case by the end of the episode. Now on the run from a different crime boss than in the first season, Charlie is still on the road, travelling to a different place in every episode, each featuring a slew of guest stars. This time they include Cynthia Erivo, Awkwafina, Giancarlo Esposito, Kumail Nanjiani, John Mulaney, Katie Holmes and about two dozen others, as Charlie stumbles across trouble at a funeral home, a baseball game and an alligator farm. Running through it all are Lyonne's trademark sardonic delivery and the series's fast-paced retro feel. Poker Face premieres 8 May on Peacock in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK Judy Blume's 1975 YA novel about first love is reimagined with an update in this series set in Los Angeles in 2018, with a cast largely composed of black actors. High school students Keisha (Lovie Simone), a track star, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), a basketball player, are childhood friends who lost touch. When they meet again at a party and fall in love, they face all the intense feelings and decisions that brings. Over the years, Blume's novel has been banned in several US states for the direct way its characters confront the question of when to have their first sexual experience (Blume's honesty is exactly what many fans like about her) and the issue needed a new lens for the 21st Century. But the series' showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, has also leant into the timeless theme of romance, and the Los Angeles setting feeds into it. ""What better metaphor for this love story than what LA represents,"" she has said. ""You're looking for a place to follow your dreams, and love is a part of that."" Forever premieres 8 May on Netflix internationally Retro television is having a moment with Poker Face and this action drama set in 1972 in the Southwest US. JJ Abrams is an executive producer and, along with LaToya Morgan, wrote the first two episodes of the series, which stars Josh Holloway, still best known as Sawyer from Abrams's Lost, as a swaggering driver for a crime syndicate. Rachel Hilson plays the first black female FBI agent, who chases him down, with Keith David as the syndicate's boss. In addition to the cat-and-mouse crime story and possibly wavering loyalties, Duster has knife fights, cars flipping over and dust all around. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter that the series came about because ""I had this image of a phone booth in the middle of the desert and a car driving up, and a guy getting on the phone to find out where he was meant to go next"". That turned into a show that he calls ""a crazy story"" with humour, absurdity and lots of plot turns. Duster premieres 15 May on Max in the US Television is full of sci-fi series, but this one has a comic twist and Alexander Skarsg√•rd, as a robot who manages to hack its own system and go rogue. ""I am a security unit,"" it announces in its cheery voiceover. ""I was built to protect and obey humans. And humans are idiots."" Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy) created the show, based on Martha Wells' series of books, The Murderbot Diaries, and have given it a Blade Runner-meets-Black Mirror style. Although the title robot calls itself Murderbot, it doesn't really want to kill anyone. It prefers sitting around bingeing its favourite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a series-within-the-series with John Cho and Jack McBrayer playing the leads. When it lands on a new planet, its social awkwardness creates a very human problem, which makes it, Skarsg√•rd told Empire magazine, ""more relatable than most characters I've ever played"". Of course, he has played Tarzan and a vampire, so relatable is a relative thing. Murderbot premieres 16 May on Apple TV+ internationally Nicole Kidman and her collection of improbable wigs ‚Äì see The Undoing or The Perfect Couple ‚Äì are now television mainstays. In season two of this series based on a Liane Moriarty novel, she returns as psychedelic-dispensing wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko, still Russian-accented but now with a pin-straight bob instead of a waist-length mop of waves. She has also relocated her week-long retreat from sunny California to the snowy Austrian Alps, where another crop of troubled, privileged characters turn up ‚Äì like The White Lotus but with a cult-like, possibly charlatan therapist. As Kidman told Vanity Fair about Masha, ""She morphs. She adapts."" New characters are played by another starry cast, including Henry Golding, Christine Baranski, Mark Strong, Lena Olin and Murray Bartlett. Let the wig-games begin. Vulture has even ranked them. Nine Perfect Strangers premieres 21 May on Hulu in the US and 22 May on Amazon Prime Video in the UK Julianne Moore and Meghann Fahy star in this dark comedy about power, class and control, set over one weekend on a wealthy resort island. Moore plays Michaela, a philanthropist and animal activist who is also iron-fisted in her control of island society. Her personal assistant, Simone (Milly Alcock, who played the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragons), is so in thrall to her that Simone's sister, Devon, (Fahy) comes to the island to stage an intervention. Kevin Bacon plays Michaela's billionaire husband, with Glenn Howerton and Bill Camp among the supporting cast. The series was created by Molly Smith Metzler, who also created the hit Netflix series Maid. She based Sirens on her 2011 play Elemeno Pea, and has said that the show has ""a Greek mythology vibe"", presumably because Michaela sends out such a siren's call to Simone. But details are scarce, so for all we know this siren, as in mythology, could turn out to be half bird. Fully human or not, Moore is always worth watching. Sirens premieres 22 May on Netflix internationally Matthew Goode stars in this crime thriller, the latest show from Scott Frank, the creator of terrific series including The Queen's Gambit and Monsieur Spade. The hero, Carl Morck (Goode), is an abrasive detective in Edinburgh whose partner has been paralyzed on the job, sending him into a tailspin and landing him a low-profile role as head of a new cold-case unit called Department Q. Headquartered in a basement, his unit of misfits is meant to be no more than a publicity move for the police ‚Äì but as in Slow Horses, the band of outcasts is smarter than their prized colleagues. Frank based the show on a series of Danish novels and changed the setting to Edinburgh, where it was shot. Meanwhile, Morck has been made into an Englishman, a fish out of water whose ex-wife is Scottish, which accounts for his very bad attitude toward all Scots. The top-flight cast includes Kelly Macdonald and Shirley Henderson. Dept Q premieres 29 May on Netflix internationally An unlikely family tangle is beneath the plot of this thriller with Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks as estranged sisters who have very different lives. Biel plays Chloe, a polished media executive who lives in upscale comfort with her lawyer husband (Corey Stoll) and teenage son. Banks plays Nicky, a recovering addict who is struggling financially. When someone in the family is murdered, the death and their old sibling rivalry converge, as the sisters come together to find the truth of what happened. Lorraine Toussaint, Matthew Modine and Gloria Reuben are also in the cast. Olivia Milch, who co-created the show with Regina Corrado (based on a 2019 novel by Alafair Burke) told Glamour that the question of which sister is better ""changes moment to moment"", which sounds just right for a thriller. The Better Sister premieres 29 May on Prime Video internationally As she ambles into her next chapter in life, nearly 30 years after Sex and the City premiered, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) still has great shoes, as seen in the trailer for the third season of this sequel series. The new season puts her where the last one ended, in a new apartment and trying a long-distance relationship with Aiden (John Corbett). But Carrie is now writing a novel, instead of the personal column she used to write. As always, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) have their own issues. Sarita Choudhury and Nicole Ari Parker return as recently-acquired core friends Seema and Lisa, while Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone appear as brand new characters. The show has inspired long-loyal, opinionated fans, who will want to know whether or not two old favourites are missing: Che Diaz (Sarah Ramirez), Miranda's former partner who was a love-them or hate-them character, and Kim Cattrall, whose phoned-in cameo as Samantha last season ‚Äì really, she was shown in a car on the phone for a minute ‚Äì was a fizzle.

The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240607-it-was-the-cleverest-escape-in-the-prisons-30-years-the-men-who-broke-out-of-alcatraz-with-a-spoon,'It was the cleverest escape in the prison's 30 years': The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon,"On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape ‚Äì from what was the US's most secure prison ‚Äì continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime. In May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made ""the most feared journey in the criminal world"" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed ""the Rock"", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped. Alcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". ""Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,"" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it. Four years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night. When the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. ""A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,"" he said. ""Built over the rambling passages of an old fort‚Ä¶ the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up."" With Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-m√¢ch√© grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood. But while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-m√¢ch√© versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place. More like this: ‚Ä¢ How D-Day began with a death-defying mission ‚Ä¢ The US couple who survived the Alaskan wilderness ‚Ä¢ Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death' Finally, on the night of 11 June 1962, they were ready to put their ingenious plan into motion. Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it ‚Äì carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower ‚Äì shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered. The island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. ""When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,"" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. ""I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was."" The prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again. Although the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964."" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,"" he said. ""Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?"" Alcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: ""the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners"". Over the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves ‚Äì unable to face the unrelenting conditions ‚Äì and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment. As for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service. But speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them. In 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read ""I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!"" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not. The case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.

The Cold War spy mystery of the vanishing frogman,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250501-the-cold-war-spy-mystery-of-buster-crabb,'He swam out to the Russian vessel and was never seen alive again': The Cold War spy mystery of the 'vanishing frogman',"In 1956, Royal Navy Commander ""Buster"" Crabb disappeared in murky circumstances during a visit to the UK by Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan read the newly declassified files that detailed Crabb's unofficial secret mission ‚Äì and how the government tried to cover it up. It was on 9 May 1956, 68 years ago this week, that UK Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden finally succumbed to press pressure and international embarrassment, and ordered an enquiry into the mysterious disappearance of Royal Navy diver Commander Lionel ""Buster"" Crabb. The decorated frogman had vanished during a goodwill visit to the UK by the Soviet leadership at the height of Cold War tensions. When word leaked that Crabb had gone missing, The Admiralty, the government department responsible for the Navy, issued a vague statement that the diver had been testing underwater equipment at Stokes Bay on the Hampshire coast and was presumed drowned. But the story fell apart when the visiting Russians accused their hosts of espionage. The Soviets claimed that they had seen a frogman near the Ordzhonikidze ‚Äì the ship that had brought the Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev to the UK ‚Äì while it was docked in Portsmouth Harbour. Despite questions being asked repeatedly in Parliament, Eden refused to say more, claiming: ""It would not be in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which Commander Crabb is presumed to have met his death."" The government's stonewalling merely heightened suspicions that Crabb had been on a covert spy mission. Fourteen months after Crabb vanished, a headless, handless body in a diving suit was found by fishermen in Chichester Harbour on the south coast of England. Its lack of fingerprints and teeth made the mutilated body difficult to identify, but a later inquest ruled that it was Crabb. The whole episode publicly embarrassed Eden and wrecked his attempts to develop a more friendly relationship with a post-Stalin Soviet Union. When he disappeared in 1956, Crabb was well known for his daring underwater exploits. Nicknamed ""Buster"", after the US Olympic swimmer and actor Buster Crabbe, who had risen to fame in the 1930s, he was an expert in underwater bomb disposal. His bravery during World War Two had earned him the George Medal for removing Italian limpet mines from British warships at Malta, and an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his mine clearance work at Livorno in Italy. His wartime amphibious adventures would later be fictionalised in a 1958 film, The Silent Enemy, with Crabb being played by Laurence Harvey. And even after he was officially demobbed in 1947, he continued diving for the military in various capacities, including investigating sunken submarines. For decades following the frogman's disappearance, the UK government staunchly maintained its silence on the incident. It would only be from 2006 onwards, when due to Freedom of Information requests by the BBC, and classified documents being made public under the 50-year rule, that the murky circumstances of Crabb's ill-fated final dive began to emerge. The declassified files showed that, from the start, the UK's security services were keen to use the opportunity of Khruschev's visit to gather intelligence on their Cold War opponents. They suggested hiding microphones in Claridge's hotel, which the Soviet leadership intended to use as their headquarters during their stay. But the prime minister expressly ruled out the idea and made ""clear that adventures of a similar nature were forbidden"". Despite this, MI6 recruited Crabb to undertake an ""unofficial enterprise"" to investigate the Russian ship Ordzhonikidze. The exact nature of his mission is still unclear, but the ex-MI5 officer Peter Wright suggested in his book Spycatcher (1987) that it was to examine and photograph the ship's advanced propeller design. Two days before the mission, Crabb and another MI6 agent, who went by the name Bernard Smith, checked into the Sally Port hotel in Portsmouth. On the evening of 17 April 1956, Crabb met with a military colleague in a local pub. This colleague, whose name was deleted from the file, was a Royal Navy lieutenant commander who agreed to help Crabb get into Portsmouth Harbour for his final dive. In 2006, the BBC's Michael Buchanan got the chance to examine the previously classified sworn statement by ""the last man to see Crabb alive"". ""He says he was approached by the commander a couple of days before his final dive and asked 'if I would be prepared to assist him, entirely unofficially and in a strictly private capacity, in connection with a dive he was taking a day or two later'. He goes on to say under no account was this man to contact any responsible naval authority,"" said Buchanan. More like this: ‚Ä¢ The greatest sailing rescue ever made ‚Ä¢ A death-defying D-Day mission in a wooden glider ‚Ä¢ The US's most damaging double agent Just before 07:00 on 19 April, the unnamed lieutenant commander went with Crabb to Portsmouth Harbour, and helped him dress and check his equipment. Crabb then swam out to the Russian vessel, and was never seen alive again. The Royal Navy made no attempt to look for the missing frogman for fear of alerting the Ordzhonikidze's crew. ""The documents further reveal that no search and rescue efforts were made for Crabb as it was not a bonafide operation,"" said Buchanan. ""And they detailed the extensive efforts made by [the Admiralty] to ensure they weren't implicated in a botched mission they knew nothing about."" The intelligence services surmised that Crabb must have either been captured by the Soviets, been destroyed by Russian ""countermeasures"", or suffered a ""natural mishap"". Smith, the MI6 agent, removed Crabb's belongings and checked out of the Sally Port hotel. A few days later, the police removed the pages with their details from the Sally Port's register, which only served to fuel suspicions of a covert mission. Under pressure from MI6 and the government, the Admiralty hastily concocted the spurious story that Crabb had gone missing during a test in Stokes Bay. Records of meetings show the panic at the highest levels of government. Officials feared that if a body was found, the Soviets could use Crabb's death for propaganda purposes. National Archives' Howard Davis told the BBC in 2006 that the file ""makes it perfectly clear that this wasn't an Admiralty operation; they had nothing to do with it and we see them trying to construct a story that they can plausibly tell to face the inevitable questions from the press"". But despite the release of some of the government's classified documents, exactly what happened to the diver that day in 1956 is still unknown. In 1990, Joseph Zwerkin, a former Soviet naval intelligence agent, claimed that a Soviet sniper on the Ordzhonikidze's deck had spotted the diver in the water and shot him. In 2007, a 74-year-old former Russian frogman, Eduard Koltsov, claimed that he slashed Crabb's throat in an underwater fight after catching him attaching a mine to Ordzhonikidze. It has also been suggested that as Crabb was an associate of Sir Anthony Blunt, who was unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1979, he could even have defected. Nicholas Elliott, a former senior MI6 agent who was rumoured to be involved in Crabb's final dive, believed that the 47-year-old diver, who was known for his fondness for whiskey and cigarettes, had succumbed to oxygen poisoning or a heart attack as a result of his exertions while underwater. It may be some time before more details of Crabb's fate come to light. While some papers concerning the affair have been released into the public domain, others have had their classified status extended by the government and are not scheduled for release until 2057. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

"The long tradition of black dandyism, this year's Met Gala theme",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250502-how-black-men-have-used-bold-fashion-as-resistance,'Clothes can contain a lot of emotion': How black men have used flamboyant fashion to express pride and resistance,"This year's Costume Institute spring exhibition and Met Gala are honouring black ""dandy"" style, and the tradition of bold tailoring worn by black men that has made a statement. Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history. The story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), ""arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed"". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities ‚Äì in a context where the very concept of ""blackness"" was created by non-black oppressors. Inspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme ""Tailored for you"" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James. The show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The ""superfine"" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to ""a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'"" ‚Äì a reminder that how you dress can contain ""a lot of emotion"". Indeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. ""Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,"" Miller tells the BBC. ""It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised."" Dandyism was already laying its foundations. In the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters ‚Äì in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman. However, in the case of Julius Soubise ‚Äì manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury ‚Äì the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be. While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing ‚Äì once again ‚Äì boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman ‚Äì complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles ‚Äì in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with ""a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]"" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his ""master"" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England. Later, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of. In forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them. The suit, explains Miller, is ""a historical throughline"" in the exhibition, which includes everything ""from livery garments‚Ä¶ to tailcoats and different versions of it‚Ä¶ to even track suiting"". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom. More like this: ‚Ä¢ Seven of the best Met Gala looks over the decades ‚Ä¢ Coachella looks from Lady Gaga to Sabrina Carpenter ‚Ä¢The indigenous American supermodel bringing change When rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched ""Hammer pants"". Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as ""a dandy among dandies"", Andr√© Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. ""He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,"" writes Wintour. ""For Andr√©, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once."" For Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Ik√© Ud√©, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. ""Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,"" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Ud√©, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. ""He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,"" explains Miller. ""It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit."" This theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline ""designed by an immigrant"". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. ""He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,"" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, ""that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that"". Black dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. ""Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture."" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. ""It's very much related to a jazz riff,"" Miller adds. ""Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new‚Ä¶"" Superfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025. The accompanying book by Monica L Miller is published by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and distributed by Yale University Press. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter ‚Äì a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The true story of the first-ever 'rock star' chef,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-how-19th-century-bad-boy-antonin-careme-made-food-rock-n-roll,The 'first celebrity chef': How 19th-Century cook Antonin Car√™me made extraordinary food fit for kings,"A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called ""King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"" ‚Äì shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks. It's described as ""the story of the first celebrity chef"". The French language series Car√™me is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Car√™me, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today ‚Äì giving birth to the very idea of the ""celebrity"" chef. Indeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Car√™me, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, ""he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,"" he tells the BBC. And Voisin's portrayal of Car√™me feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen ‚Äì a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. The series is inspired by a biography of Car√™me and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a ""bookish innocent"" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Car√™me aged 25: ""He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater."" Kelly also describes Car√™me as ""ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic"" as a person ‚Äì although the Car√™me on screen risks much for those he loves. Indeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Car√™me as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as ""the charm of fiction in the show"". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, ""He [Car√™me] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life‚Ä¶ and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing."" What is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Car√™me's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University. ""He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,"" Freedman tells the BBC. ""He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Car√™me."" While some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience. Bourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid ""the usual period drama style"" in this story. ""I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Car√™me,"" he says. ""And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life."" Voisin says their idea of the chef was that he had ""a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me"". ""I love looking to the historical story of Car√™me, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society."" The historical Car√™me's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as ""the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings"". He's often credited as a founder of French gastronomy and of Grande Cuisine (classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century). However, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman Guillaume Tirel, known as ""Taillevent"", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several restaurants still bear his name. Car√™me's status is, he says, ""a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs. ""So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant."" The young Car√™me's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Car√™me: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that the ""Reign of Terror"" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable p√¢tissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-P√©rigord, known as Talleyrand. Even if the real Car√™me didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now. ""We know that Car√™me worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Car√™me brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time."" Politics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, ""Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so"". The visuals directly link the food Car√™me cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Car√™me licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri. ""The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,"" Voisin says. ""Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection."" The link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Car√™me's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital ""had become the City of Light ‚Äì and the capital of food"". The talk around the young Car√™me, he says, would have been ""of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris"". Car√™me's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says. ""I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,"" he tells the BBC. A French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. ""One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit."" The era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Car√™me's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from ""economic disaster"". ""Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,"" she says. ""That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Car√™me wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty."" A later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) ‚Äì who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London ‚Äì ""is really Car√™me's heir,"" Cooke says. ""Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,"" she explains. ""He was able to achieve Car√™me's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Car√™me could not, because Car√™me was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too."" (Car√™me did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.) The emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Car√™me Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour. In another nod to modernity, the young Car√™me in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's ""Showstopper"" category might trace its ancestry back to Car√™me's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France. But now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly ""celebrity"" chef ""My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adri√†, who was at El Bulli, or Ren√© Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented."" There is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Car√™me ‚Äì and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention. ""Although Car√™me's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,"" he says. ""I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together ‚Äì food, love and politics."" Car√™me premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Thunderbolts* is 'the greatest Marvel in years' ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250429-thunderbolts-film-review,Thunderbolts* review: 'The greatest Marvel offering in years',"The latest in the superhero franchise ""is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun"", with a ""charismatic"" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber. Ever since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end. The Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called ""Infinity Saga"" ‚Äì the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years. The key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods. There's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong ‚Äì but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep. De Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better. One small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not. More like this: ‚Ä¢ A combat epic that 'does what film does best' ‚Ä¢ Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis' ‚Ä¢ Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' The underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts ‚Äì and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes. At both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion ‚Äì and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter ‚Äì a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Why Sinners has become a box-office sensation,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250428-the-reason-sinners-has-become-a-true-box-office-sensation,'It doesn't stick to the rules': The reason Sinners has become a true box-office sensation,"After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises. In less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a ""rule-defying"" proposition that ""continues to defy all the odds"", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (¬£34m) against its opening $48m (¬£36m). ""Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,"" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be ""the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013"". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (¬£120m), against a $90m (¬£67m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner ‚Äì just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that ""profitability remains a question mark"". Perhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film ‚Äì but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves ‚Äì which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: ""Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?"" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread. This unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material ‚Äì or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station ‚Äì but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as ""something to hide behind"". He wanted to make the most personal film he could ‚Äì a ""love letter"" to a late uncle from Mississippi ‚Äì and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions. More like this: ‚Ä¢ 10 of the best films of 2025 so far ‚Ä¢ The best films to watch in April ‚Ä¢ Warfare review: it 'does what film does best' In some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with ""must-see"" and ""must-talk-about"" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: ""I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo."" That could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today. -- If you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.
