Chris from Tilbury If you are English, I think the Liverpool-Barcelona semi-final is still the one to beat. But for the neutral fan, last night's game was absolutely bonkers and absolutely brilliant. Mark the ""elite"" fan, from Hastings Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of added time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie, the 37-year-old charging around with his shirt off in wild celebrations. And there were more ecstatic scenes when substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra-time before climbing up a security fence to celebrate in front of Inter's fans. It means a second Champions League final in three seasons for three-time European champions Inter after two legs of incredible drama which saw 13 goals and a tie turned on its head on several occasions. Inter, who lost 1-0 to Manchester City in the 2023 final, will play either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday, 31 May in the 2025 showpiece. OK, let's walk back through last night's game now together. For those who missed it, sit down as there is a lot to take in...

Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Alan Shearer perhaps summed it up best when he rounded off his commentary for broadcaster Amazon Prime by simply thanking both sides. ""Thank you Inter Milan, thank you Barcelona for providing us with incredible entertainment and two great football matches,"" he said. ""What we have witnessed has been something very special. It's been a pleasure to be here."" Inter Milan 4-3 Barcelona AET (agg 7-6) Mat makes sense of it in binary form there, but seriously, where do you start? Players on both sides ended the match in tears, but there were no recriminations at the full-time whistle, just a mutual respect. The emotion flooded out of centre-back Francesco Acerbi, who was pushed forward at the end of normal time and scored his first European goal at the age of 37 to make it 3-3 on the night and 6-6 on aggregate. Inter players rushed to offer their commiserations to Barcelona stars Lamine Yamal and Raphinia, who had done so much to drag their side back from two goals down to the brink of victory, before substitute Davide Frattesi settled the tie with an extra-time winner. Frattesi found the bottom corner with a cultured strike to make it 4-3 on the night, 7-6 on aggregate - the combined 13 goals over the two legs the joint highest for a Champions League semi-final.

'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c23038lpv4mo,'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end,"Inter Milan will face Paris St-Germain or Arsenal in the final on 31 May ""It gave us everything. From start to finish last week to this week, everything about this semi-final has been pure entertainment,"" said Alan Shearer. For the second time in six days Inter Milan and Barcelona served up a European classic as the champions of Italy won 4-3 on the night - 7-6 on aggregate - to reach the Champions League final. In a thriller that will be remembered for years to come, Barca had trailed 2-0 and 3-2 in the first leg in Catalonia before salvaging a 3-3 draw. On Tuesday in Milan, they were then 2-0 behind at half-time - 5-3 on aggregate - before scoring three times without reply. Raphinha's 87th-minute strike was the first time Barca had taken the lead on aggregate but Francesco Acerbi's first European goal at the age of 37 took an utterly absorbing tie into extra time, with substitute Davide Frattesi scoring the winner to send more than 70,000 Inter fans inside the San Siro into raptures. It was the joint highest-scoring Champions League semi-final ever, with the 13 goals equalling the 2018 semi-final when Liverpool also defeated Roma 7-6 on aggregate. ""We didn't expect this, did we?"" added former England captain Shearer, who was inside the San Siro for Amazon Prime. ""We expected a good game, but this? Thank you Inter Milan, thank you Barcelona for providing us with incredible entertainment and two great football matches. ""What we have witnessed has been something very special. It's been a pleasure to be here."" Inter will face either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal - who meet in the other semi-final in France on Wednesday (20:00 BST) - after one of the great modern classics. PSG lead 1-0 from the first leg. Inter beat Barcelona in all-time classic to reach Champions League final - reaction Where does Inter v Barca rank among best ever semi-finals? Inter have conceded eight goals in their past three Champions League games No neutrals wanted this tie full of twists and turns to end but, when Polish referee Szymon Marciniak sounded the final whistle at 23:38 local time, Inter Milan's players sank to their knees exhausted but triumphant. They remained on the pitch for a good 15 to 20 minutes after full-time to show their appreciation to their delirious fans, who can start booking flights and hotels for the final in Munich on 31 May. ""Inter were heading out, they were done,"" added Shearer. ""They somehow found a way to get themselves into the final. They deserve to be there."" Inter's success in this season's competition has been built on dogged resilience and clean sheets. Not against Barcelona. They conceded more goals against the La Liga leaders over 210 minutes than they had in their opening 12 matches in this season's Champions League put together. The three-time winners had kept eight clean sheets in all, with Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer recording seven of those. On Tuesday alone, Barcelona peppered Inter's goal with 22 attempts - 10 on target - and scored three times in the space of 33 minutes. But Inter dug deep to go through with substitute Davide Frattesi scoring his side's extra-time winner. ""What happened? I don't know!"" he said afterwards. ""I celebrated so loudly that my head was spinning."" Inter's Francesco Acerbi is the second oldest scorer in a Champions League semi-final (37 years & 85 days) after Ryan Giggs for Manchester United against Schalke in 2010-11 (37 years & 148 days) It is 15 years since Inter - managed by Jose Mourinho at the time - were crowned champions of Europe. No Italian side has won the Champions League since that victory over Bayern Munich in 2010. Will that change at the end of the month? While they weren't necessarily the obvious choice to win this year's competition, before a ball was kicked Opta did rate them as third favourites to go all the way behind Real Madrid and Manchester City. With both of those teams already out, Inter are now in the box seat. And they went back in time to reach their second final in three seasons. The 2023 runners-up to Manchester City are unbeaten in 16 home games in the Champions League - their longest undefeated run on their own turf in Europe since the 1980s. ""It was an amazing night,"" said Inter boss Simone Inzaghi. ""One to share with our fans, our club and our families. The players did something extraordinary. ""We played four amazing games against two world-class teams like Bayern [in the quarter-final] and Barcelona. It was great to celebrate this achievement here with our fans."" Inter's Netherlands defender Denzel Dumfries ended with two goals and three assists over the two legs against Barcelona. ""A crazy match again! Seven goals today... it was incredible,"" said Dumfries. Italy midfielder Frattesi added: ""After the game in Munich, I thought I would never experience anything like this again in terms of emotions. ""But that's the beauty of football. It's part of my career; I've always been the first to believe and the last to give up.""

"'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls",https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cx272egzwweo,"'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls","Head coach Andy Farrell (third from left) and his staff have lots of permutations to mull over The action is over, the auditions are done. Last weekend's European semi-finals were the final chance for British and Irish Lions contenders to sway head coach Andy Farrell their way. On Thursday, the talking finishes too. Back in March, Farrell said he had a list of about 75 potential tourists. When he announces his squad for Australia this summer, he and his coaches will have boiled that group down to about 37 players. The squad has been debated for months and will continue to be after Wales and Lions legend Ieuan Evans reads out the names of the chosen few from 14:00 BST on Thursday at the O2 arena. Here are some of the hottest pre-announcement topics chewed over by BBC Sport's team of pundits. LISTEN: 5 Live Lions' squad announcement preview LISTEN: Rugby Union Weekly on Lions watch LISTEN: Scrum V Lions selection committee Itoje led England Under-20s to an age-grade World Cup triumph in 2014, but otherwise had little experience of captaining until this season Might one of the two horses in the race to captain the Lions have fallen at the final hurdle? Ireland number eight Caelan Doris picked up a shoulder injury in Leinster's Champions Cup semi-final defeat by Northampton this weekend, putting his touring hopes in danger. Maro Itoje may well have earned the accolade ahead of Doris regardless, but with such uncertainty over his rival for the post now, the way seems even more clear for the second row. The 30-year-old, who had not been either his club or country's regular skipper until the start of this season, would be completing a captaincy clean sweep on his third Lions tour. ""I would agree with it going to Maro,"" former England and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Matt Dawson told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""There are a couple of absolute fundamentals with Lions tour captains - first and foremost they have to be in the team and for me he is, without a shadow of a doubt. ""Secondly, he has to be held in that regard, not just by the coaches, but also by his team-mates as well. The players have to look at their captain and think 'this guy is the man'. ""Thirdly, for Maro specifically, he has blossomed beautifully this season for England. ""He has gone from being a player who was a certainty to be in the team, but was a bit short of the form of his early 20s and a little bit too ill disciplined, to being right in the groove. ""The captaincy has given him a new lease of life and he is ready to step into the role for the Lions."" Shane Horgan, who toured New Zealand alongside Dawson with the 2005 Lions, agrees. ""I think Itoje is the frontrunner,"" he said. ""You need a different type of charisma to be Lions captain because within your own nation, you can get 20 caps, build relationships with the team, become a senior player and then captain. There is none of that with the Lions. ""There are lots of players you won't have a relationship with at all - you have to be 100% respected and have a bit of an aura."" An Achilles tendon injury restricted Finn Russell's game time on the 2021 tour of South Africa Finn Russell is the man in possession of the British and Irish Lions number 10 jersey. Four years ago, he was ushered into the fray early in the deciding third Test against the Springboks and, although the tourists lost, Russell's dexterity and daring stood out. However after a modest Six Nations campaign with Scotland and the appointment of Russell-sceptic Johnny Sexton as one of the Lions coaches, doubt has been cast over whether the 30-year-old could even make the squad. Former Ireland hooker and Scarlets coach Bernard Jackman believes Russell should be straight into the team. ""For me, Russell is the starting 10,"" he told Scrum V. ""I think the stuff around Johnny joining the coaching staff - I think that will be done. ""The area Andy Farrell is most comfortable in coaching is attack. ""When you think of Ireland's attack going into the last Rugby World Cup in 2023, it was so patterned and intricate. Someone with Russell's instinct, with his passing, running and kicking game, could be unbelievably strong in that. ""I would be shocked if he wasn't on the plane. I think it is the job of the coaches to set the team up to bring the best out of him because that would bring the best out of everybody else."" Horgan agrees, adding that Russell's Lions credentials have been proven. ""Given Scotland have won just one of their past 16 meetings against his Ireland team, it will be hard for Andy Farrell to eliminate some of the doubts he may have about some of their players,"" he told 5 Live. ""But, I don't think that counts for Finn. If there was ever any doubts about Finn, they were blown out of the water by his performances on the tour in 2021. ""He was phenomenal and should have played more."" Fin Smith and Sam Prendergast, first-choice fly-halves for England and Ireland respectively, went up against each other in club colours on Saturday Twenty-nine minutes into Northampton's shock win against Leinster in the Champions Cup semi-final on Saturday, Henry Pollock took a short ball off Alex Mitchell, punched a hole and pinned back his ears. The ease with which he rounded Leinster fly-half Sam Prendergast to scorch in for a try set tongues wagging among those on the look-out for Lions. ""That must have been the worst performances Prendergast has had this season,"" said 2009 British and Irish Lions winger Ugo Monye on Rugby Union Weekly. ""You can forgive missed kicks at goal, but there was a lack of control. ""He looked like he was the fly-half playing away, he couldn't impose himself on the game. ""No-one missed more tackles in the Six Nations this year and, as well as being ruined by Henry Pollock, he looked non-committal in defence, making tap tackles. ""He will become such a focus for an attack."" ""I don't think you can take Sam, as great as his attacking ability is at the line,"" agreed former Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert on 5 Live. ""His defence is a real liability and Australia coach Joe Schmidt will be clued into that. ""His tackle completion is way, way too low to be chosen. ""By contrast, I think Northampton fly-half Fin Smith played his way onto the plane. ""That game was as close to an international as you can get, in terms of ferocity and physicality, and Fin Smith was at the heart of it, controlling things in one of the best away wins I have ever seen in Europe."" Scarlets' Murray backed to be a Lions bolter Injured Lions hopeful Hansen out for about five weeks When is the British and Irish Lions squad named? Pollock's exuberance has won over a legion of fans Pollock began this season with just one Premiership appearance to his name. His precipitous climb towards the top shows no sign of stopping though. The 20-year-old has scored more tries and beaten more defenders than any other forward in the Champions Cup this season. He has made more tackles and secured more turnovers than any other player full stop. ""Previously I thought maybe the Lions had come too soon for him,"" said former England scrum-half Danny Care on Rugby Union Weekly. ""But watching that win over Leinster, how can you not take him? ""He looked better, in every aspect, than one of the best Ireland back rows ever. ""He is an 80-minute player. To be at that level mentally and physically, in a Test match-level environment is superb. ""I like everything this kid is about. ""I'm not sure if he would start, but how good would he be for competition on that tour? ""Lob him into a midweek team and if you picked him for Test side, he wouldn't look out of place."" ""Farrell can't not pick him,"" agreed Horgan. ""Pollock was phenomenal at the weekend. It was as good a performance as I have seen in a long time. ""He doesn't know how to be bad and he will bring crazy enthusiasm - and for that reason I think he will be picked."" Williams has shone for club side Gloucester since arriving at Kingsholm from Cardiff in the summer Tomos Williams' livewire performances for both Gloucester and Wales have put him in contention for a scrum-half spot, although Scotland's Ben White - who has a ready-made understanding with Russell - could trump him in the expected race to join Ireland's Jamison Gibson-Park and England's Alex Mitchell in the squad. ""My instinct says that Ben White would better fit the way that Andy Farrell would want to play and how the Lions could play,"" said Dawson. ""And that connection with Finn Russell could be quite handy. ""However it is a valid point that the Lions organisers will want to have a healthy Wales contingent and that might count against White. That factor might edge a toss-of-a-coin decision."" ""I would be very surprised if Tomos is not on that plane, given both his form and the type of bloke he would be in that environment,"" said Cuthbert. ""Andy Farrell would like him. Tomos is very dry, and very good at being the centre of a changing room, bringing the best out of players around him."" Smith suffered an ankle injury on his last outing for Harlequins, a defeat by Leicester at the end of April Marcus Smith was called up for the last British and Lions tour while playing a summer international for England against Canada. While halfway down Allianz Stadium's tunnel, he was told by England support staff that he would be boarding a plane to South Africa, as well as a bus back to south London. The 26-year-old seemed in prime position for a fly-half slot this time around after some virtuoso displays for England in the second half of 2024. However the emergence of namesake Fin and a positional shuffle to full-back during the Six Nations has made predicting Smith's inclusion for 2025 a lot harder. Danny Care, who plays with Smith at Harlequins, backs him. ""Scotland full-back Blair Kinghorn is likely to arrive late on the tour from Toulouse so it is a massive string to Marcus Smith's bow being able to play 15,"" Care said. ""If you have two big movers on the wings, be it James Lowe, Tommy Freeman or Duhan van der Merwe, you need someone who can link and create space for them. ""Marcus Smith is the best one-on-one attacker coming from the back. He has been for two or three years. ""Added to which I don't think Andy Farrell will forget how well he played at 10 in the autumn. Some players have credit in the bank."" However Smith may find that positional specialists are preferred to his versatility. ""For all his brilliance as a player, I don't think Marcus Smith is in the top three for fly-halves who get the most out of their backline,"" said Horgan. ""Finn Russell, Fin Smith and Sam Prendergast all get backlines motoring better and I don't think you can have Marcus Smith as a starting full-back. ""He will do brilliant things, but I don't think he is a starting full-back.""

Inter Miami relinquish option to speak to De Bruyne,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2303n2zl0yo,Inter Miami relinquish option to speak to De Bruyne,"Kevin de Bruyne has scored 108 goals in 418 appearances for Manchester City Inter Miami have relinquished their option to hold talks with departing Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne - leaving Chicago Fire in pole position to sign him should he decide to move to Major League Soccer. Miami had the 33-year-old on their 'discovery list', meaning they were the only MLS team able to negotiate with him in the United States. They had until mid-July to decide whether to hold talks but sources have told BBC Sport they will not pursue his signing meaning De Bruyne will not link up with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets. Chicago now have the first option to speak to De Bruyne, who announced in April he would be leaving City when his current deal expires at the end of the season. Sources say De Bruyne's representatives are to meet with Chicago, who are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference. The Belgian later said he was surprised not to be offered a new contract by the club. De Bruyne has won 16 trophies at Etihad Stadium, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.

Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c93g3g5yp2qo,Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?,"In what is already being talked about as one of the greatest Champions League semi-finals of all time, Inter Milan edged past Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate to reach the final in Munich. As one BBC Sport reader messaged to say: ""Football needed that tie."" But where does it rank among other memorable semi-final showdowns? We've picked 10 of the best - including Tuesday's humdinger at the San Siro - which you can read about below and then rank them in order of your favourite. Davide Frattesi celebrated in spectacular style after putting Inter 7-6 up on aggregate in extra time Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of stoppage time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when 37-year-old centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie. And substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra time. Barca had earlier recovered from 5-3 down on aggregate to lead 6-5 - having also trailed 2-0 and 3-2 during an equally remarkable first leg. Real Madrid beat Liverpool in the final in 2022 A thrilling first leg at Etihad Stadium saw Pep Guardiola overcome his old rivals on his most recent pursuit of Champions League glory. His side battled with Real Madrid to take a 4-3 lead into the second leg. In a game which was not short of chances, Riyad Mahrez extended City's advantage at the Bernabeu to leave Carlo Ancelotti's men needing two goals just to take the tie to extra time. Substitute Rodrygo kick-started an incredible turnaround, putting two efforts past Ederson in as many minutes right at the end of normal time. To Manchester City's disbelief they now had to put up with a fully enthused Madrid side, who managed to grab a place in the Champions League final thanks to a 95th-minute penalty from Karim Benzema. Pure drama. Liverpool went on to beat Tottenham 2-0 in the 2019 final Finalists the previous year, Jurgen Klopp's side looked as though they were heading out after a goal from Luis Suarez and a Lionel Messi double - including a dream free-kick - condemned them to a 3-0 first-leg loss at the Nou Camp. Liverpool needed a second-leg miracle. Usual starters Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were missing - but up stepped Divock Origi. The striker pulled one back in the first 10 minutes and, as belief rose inside a fervent Anfield, midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum popped up with two goals in two minutes to level the tie. Rarely have you seen Barcelona so rattled. Messi was as anonymous as he was omnipresent just a week earlier, and when Origi swept in Trent Alexander-Arnold's quick corner with 11 minutes left the incredible had become reality. Tottenham have not reached the Champions League last four since 2019 Ajax had been the breakout side of 2018-19, beating Real Madrid and Juventus to set up a tie with Tottenham. So it was perhaps no surprise when they left London with a 1-0 lead. In Amsterdam things went from bad to worse for Tottenham. With no Harry Kane up front, they were facing a mountain to climb when Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech made it 3-0 on aggregate before half-time. Lucas Moura inspired a magnificent comeback. The forward scored twice in the space of four minutes to leave the visitors needing one goal to go through, and after Jan Vertonghen had headed against the post, Moura's low drive completed his hat-trick to give his side victory on the away goals rule and set up an all-English final against Liverpool. Robert Lewandowski scored a first-leg treble as Borussia Dortmund knocked out Real Madrid in 2013 This was the first year Jurgen Klopp came to the attention of many in the UK, with Borussia Dortmund scoring twice in added time to beat Malaga in the previous round. Still, they weren't fancied to pull up too many trees against Real Madrid, but produced a remarkable first-leg display at the Westfalenstadion. Robert Lewandowski - who would leave a year later for free - scored four times as Real were routed 4-1. The Polish forward was too mobile for Pepe and Sergio Ramos, scoring a second-half treble in front of the yellow wall. Real needed a 3-0 win in the second leg to go through but a fine performance from Klopp's men looked to have done enough. However, two goals in the last 10 minutes, from Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos, ensured a nervy finale as Dortmund just about hung on. John Terry saw red as Chelsea held on to beat Barcelona in 2012 The first leg at Stamford Bridge saw Barcelona come close, but it was Chelsea, through Didier Drogba, who edged ahead 1-0. Back to the Nou Camp and it was the anchorman Sergio Busquets who popped up with a tap-in to level the aggregate scores. It was one-way traffic and soon Chelsea were seriously up against it when captain John Terry saw red for a knee in the back of Alexis Sanchez. Lionel Messi then teed up Andres Iniesta to make it 2-1 on aggregate and Chelsea needed a goal. Ramires was the unlikely man to find it, a superb finish to chip Victor Valdes - all before half-time. Messi then missed a penalty, planting it against the crossbar, before Barcelona, facing defeat on away goals, were caught on the break. Fernando Torres had the whole half to run into, rounded Valdes and rolled in to cap a remarkable win. Avram Grant led Chelsea to their first Champions League final Chelsea came up against their previous semi-final rivals Liverpool, who knocked them out in the last four in both 2004-05 and 2006-07. In a cagey first leg, Liverpool had a one-goal lead thanks to a close-range shot from Dirk Kuyt. However, Chelsea were offered a lifeline in the dying minutes as John Arne Riise nodded a clearing header into his own net. At Stamford Bridge, Didier Drogba gave the Blues the lead in the opening half but opposing forward Fernando Torres levelled after the break. Extra time was needed and Frank Lampard converted a penalty to put Chelsea 3-2 ahead on aggregate before Drogba stepped up again to score his second of the night. Ryan Babel's audacious effort reduced the deficit but it was not enough and Liverpool would not make another semi-final until 2017-18. Kaka scored three goals over the two legs A fantastic start to the tie for Manchester United saw Cristiano Ronaldo put them ahead in the first 10 minutes. But then Kaka entered the scene. The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner collected a pass and glided past United with ease before planting a fine low shot into the far corner. It was a Kaka masterclass and the Brazilian added a beautiful solo goal with his flair too much for United defenders Gabriel Heinze and Patrice Evra. Wayne Rooney did get a leveller and then powered in a superb shot from long range in stoppage time to give United a slender 3-2 lead at the halfway stage of the tie. At the San Siro, it was Kaka once again who proved the difference and his delicious left-footed drive put Milan back ahead on away goals early on. Clarence Seedorf then beat Edwin van der Sar from the edge of the area and Alberto Gilardino provided the coup de grace. Alessandro del Piero starred as Juventus squeezed past Real Madrid in 2003 The first leg was in Madrid and Ronaldo opened the scoring with a superb finish from the edge of the area. Juventus grabbed an away goal on the stroke of half-time when David Trezeguet stabbed in a deflected shot from Alessandro del Piero. Real were back in front when Roberto Carlos' piledriver went through a sea of players and it was on to Turin. Trezeguet spurred Juve's second-leg comeback as his close-range effort put the home side ahead on away goals. Real needed a goal, on came Ronaldo, and he won a penalty with a trademark body swerve. Up stepped Luis Figo, but Gianluigi Buffon saved his spot-kick. It was the key moment as within five minutes Pavel Nedved had outpaced Fernando Hierro to fire in, and while Zinedine Zidane scored against his old team, it was too late. Andrew Cole sealed Man Utd's memorable win against Juventus in 1999 The 1999 Treble win for Manchester United is etched into the public consciousness, even if the final against Bayern Munich was largely quite dull - until the incredible finale. The two-legged semi-final against Juventus was dramatic from start to finish. The first leg at Old Trafford saw future Chelsea boss Antonio Conte strike the Italian giants into an early lead before a second-half United siege finally bore fruit when Ryan Giggs hammered into the roof of the net in the last minute. With the tie all square at 1-1, Juve were favourites in the second leg, even more so when Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Game over? Nobody told Roy Keane. His header gave United hope and he led by example throughout, despite picking up a yellow card that would rule him out of the final. Dwight Yorke headed United level on the night - and ahead on away goals - before half-time in this classic encounter. Inzaghi had a hat-trick 'goal' correctly ruled out for offside, before Andrew Cole tapped in to seal a famous win for United.

Four ways Arteta can mastermind Arsenal comeback v PSG,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0r5krkl98do,Four ways Arteta can mastermind Arsenal comeback v PSG,"PSG have racked up 82 shots (29 on target) when hosting Manchester City, Liverpool and Aston Villa at the intimidating Parc des Princes this season. Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will use ""rage, anger, frustration"" and ""a bad feeling in the tummy"" to try and overturn the 1-0 Champions League semi-final first-leg deficit against Paris St-Germain. For supporters travelling to Paris on Wednesday, the scene of Arsenal's 2006 Champions League final defeat, the stomach churns. Arsenal have not scored in any of their past seven semi-final matches in all competitions (losing five and drawing two). But PSG have their own Champions League ghosts, their own archive of meltdowns. The tie still hangs in the balance. Thomas Partey's return to Arsenal's midfield could be decisive, as could Ousmane Dembele's fitness after only training since Monday. Then there is the tactical battle, won by Luis Enrique in the first leg but, thanks to Mikel Arteta's mid-game tweaks, perhaps set up to swing in Arsenal's favour. Get past the nerves and the historic trauma, and Arsenal supporters have reason to feel optimistic. Four reasons, to be exact. For any pessimistic fans, some good news: the first thing Arsenal have to do can be filed under ""more of the same"". The last 70, that is, not the first 20. PSG overwhelmed Arsenal in the first 20 minutes at the Emirates, cutting through midfield like a knife through butter. They held 77% possession in that spell as wave after wave of attack pushed the hosts back. Enrique's initial setup flummoxed Arsenal's 4-4-2. Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves sat high, pinning Declan Rice and Mikel Merino, which left Ousmane Dembele free to drop off the front line and become the spare man in the middle. Whenever Arsenal's two-man midfield looked to cover Dembele, there was always at least one of those two high eights free. In this example, as shown on Match of the Day, both Ruiz and Neves are free between the lines as Arsenal set up initially in a 4-4-2 shape On Match of the Day, pundit Stephen Warnock explained how Arsenal's Bukayo Saka was breaking out of the 4-4-2 shape ""too early"" which opened up the left-hand side for PSG. So Arteta changed the shape to a 4-2-3-1, below, dropping Martin Odegaard out of the front line and into midfield to track Vitinha. Arsenal now had an extra body in the middle to cope with those intelligent rotations between Vitinha, Neves, and Ruiz, which - coupled with the centre-backs moving more aggressively out to meet Dembele - stopped PSG from dominating. After the opening 20-minute period, Arteta tweaks Arsenal's set-up into a 4-2-3-1 formation. Odegaard sits on Vitinha and Arsenal's midfield five have just one player each to track, solidifying the centre Arsenal grew in confidence and, winning tackles in midfield, started to gain territory and get attackers on the ball. From minutes 21 to 95, Arsenal held 55% possession and out-shot PSG 10-7. Partey's return should help them do that again, only better. He probably would have sniffed out the danger to prevent Dembele's winner last week, and ought to track the PSG midfielders more intelligently than Merino was able to. But all eyes should be on the key battle of the game: Odegaard's man-marking job on Vitinho, the metronome and orchestrator of Enrique's fluid possession football. Across the 'Big Five' leagues in Europe, Vitinha ranks second only to Bayern's Joshua Kimmich for both touches per 90 (117) and passes completed per 90 (98). Stop Vitinha and you probably stop PSG. Either Rice or Merino should have moved across to cover Dembele before his fourth-minute goal In a 4-2-3-1 shape Arsenal should be PSG's equals, immediately solving a lot of problems and creating a more even game territorially. From here, Arteta can move his focus to getting more out of Odegaard when the Gunners have possession, The Norwegian has been criticised by some fans for his lack of big-game impact. ""We had especially one issue that we corrected after 15-20 minutes,"" Arteta said after the first leg. ""We sustained that for the rest of the game, which I think turned the game around."" Pressed further on what he meant, Arteta told reporters it was ""an issue we had with the ball"" adding: ""In a very specific moment, you don't have the chance to present and they decide to bring all the midfielders back, you're going to struggle."" Arteta was probably referring to Odegaard's failure to ""present"" when Arsenal were in possession; he touched the ball just three times in the first 20 minutes. Below, in the 11th minute, Odegaard is nowhere to be seen, forcing William Saliba and David Raya to exchange passes twice before PSG win the ball: Odegaard, roaming too high and out of shot, leaves Saliba (on the ball) without a forward pass Odegaard showed more as the game went on and helped Arsenal build through the thirds, although he still had a limited impact by his high standards. Only 10 of his 30 passes went forward by more than a yard. Odegaard's pass map from the PSG first leg - many of his passes were sideways The solution is to drop Odegaard even deeper. The Arsenal captain thrives when allowed to collect the ball on the right of midfield, getting a feel for possession before starting give-and-goes with team-mates. Notice the difference between Odegaard's heat map from the PSG first leg and from Arsenal's 7-1 victory over PSV Eindhoven earlier in the competition, widely seen as the Norwegian's best performance of the season: Image 1: Odegaard came short, into a deep right midfield position, to run the game against PSV. Image 2: Odegaard playing further forward on average, against PSG 1 of 2 Arteta needs to move Odegaard much deeper, where he can dictate the tempo with press-evading, one-touch passes, not only stopping Arsenal from being caught by the press but linking more fluidly with Saka, too. That's all the learning Arteta can do from the first leg. The rest of his week should have been spent pouring over Aston Villa's remarkable performance in their quarter-final second leg - when they beat PSG 3-2 but lost 4-5 on aggregate. ""I don't think my team has been so dominated by another team in that way,"" Luis Enrique said. ""But this opponent has to take risks because they were going out of the competition. They attacked with great intensity."" That's what Arsenal need to do. Villa's urgency, directness, and fearlessness left PSG in a muddle. Perhaps bearing the scars of collapses past, they gradually dropped deeper until they became overwhelmed by the ball-carrying of Morgan Rodgers and the pace of Marcus Rashford. We've already covered how Arsenal can push PSG back and take control. If they also bravely take risks in possession they can emulate Villa and scramble brains. Their tactical route to doing so is Miles Lewis-Skelley. He briefly became the game's key player last week when he began turning in possession and dribbling around Achraf Hakimi, opening up the pitch. Image 1: Lewis-Skelley's inverted role draws Hakimi in. Image 2: Once turned, the pitch opens up for Arsenal's left-back to drive forward and play Martinelli in behind 1 of 2 Hakimi, caught between marking Gabriel Martinelli and covering Lewis-Skelley when he inverted, might again find himself with too much to do, especially if Rice - freed into a more advanced role now Partey is back - can help create Villa-style chaos by driving forward with the ball. If all of the above goes to plan, Arsenal should win a few more free-kicks and corners than in the first leg. It remains their best route to scoring in Paris. Arsenal have scored 14 set-piece goals in the Premier League this season and produced an expected goals (xG) of 15.91 from dead balls, more than anyone in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues. Meanwhile PSG have conceded 10 set-piece goals in Ligue 1 (six from corners), amounting to 30.35% of their total goals against. That's by far the highest proportion in France and sixth-most in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues. Corners to both the front and back post have been an issue for Enrique's side all season A lot was made of this mismatch before the first leg, only for Arsenal to win just three corners and six free-kicks in the PSG half. Those numbers will climb if Arteta gets his tactical plan right, in turn engineering the kind of set-piece chances that Arsenal have relished over the last few years. That is the four-point tactical path to a famous victory in Paris. Press in a 4-2-3-1 to shut down PSG's midfield rotations; get Odegaard deep to dominate the game; take risks on the ball, and maximise set-pieces.

Titans snatch victory in extraordinary IPL finish,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c98g8y1nl96o,Titans snatch victory in extraordinary IPL finish,"The win means Gujarat close in on a place in the play-off stage Indian Premier League, Mumbai Mumbai Indians 155-8 (20 overs): Jacks 53 (35), Suryakumar 35 (24) Gujarat Titans 147-7 (19 overs): Gill 43 (46), Buttler 30 (27); Bumrah 2-19, Boult 2-22 Gujarat Titans won by three wickets (DLS method) Scorecard Gujarat Titans beat Mumbai Indians - and the rain - to snatch a remarkable final-ball victory and go top of the Indian Premier League. A see-saw match looked to have gone the way of Mumbai when a second rain delay stopped Gujarat's chase with another 24 runs needed from 12 balls - the visitors behind on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method. But the rain stopped and Gujarat's target was adjusted to 147, leaving them 15 to get from the final six balls as the match resumed moments before the cut-off at 00:30 local time. Rahul Tewatia hit the first ball for four and two balls later Gerald Coetzee slammed a straight six to leave four to get from three balls. Bowler Deepak Chahar then overstepped to gift the Titans another run, only for Coetzee to be caught off the penultimate ball with the scores level. New batter Arshad Khan scrambled the one run needed from the last ball for the Titans, although Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya still could have forced a super over but missed with his throw from mid-on when a direct hit would have run out Arshad. The Titans won by three runs via the DLS method. ""It is quite remarkable,"" former England bowler Steven Finn said on BBC Radio 5 Live commentary. ""One over, 15 needed, Coetzee hammers it for six and the tables turned immediately. This game really did have everything apart from a super over."" Titans captain Shubman Gill said: ""There were a lot of emotions, most of them frustrating because at one point we were ahead of the game and it felt like one of those Test match sessions that don't go your way. ""Everything worked out well for us. ""Even after this with so much chaos, wins like these are what get you through in a big tournament."" Who needs what to reach IPL play-offs? IPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport That all came after the visitors were cruising at 107-2 in pursuit of 156 until the first rain delay, after which they lost 4-25 in four overs amid an electric spell of fast bowling from Mumbai's quicks. Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets, Trent Boult one and Ashwani Kumar the other - all of which was in vain for Mumbai who also would have topped the table with a win. Former England captain Jos Buttler scored 30 for the Titans before the rain with a partner of 72 with Gill helped by an 11-ball over from Hardik that included two no-balls and three separate wides. ""My no-balls, and the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20 it is a crime,"" said Hardik. ""It bites you. ""The ball kept getting wetter - I don't know if it helped us or not. It was difficult."" Also wasted by Mumbai was 53 from 35 balls by England all-rounder Will Jacks in Mumbai's 155-8. Jacks, whose fifty was his first for the franchise, put on 73 with Suryakumar Yadav but Mumbai lost 6-58 after Suryakumar was dismissed for 35. The Titans move level on points with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, but sit top of the table courtesy of their superior net run-rate. Mumbai stay in the play-off places in fourth but, having played a game more than those below them, have work to do to qualify for the play-offs.

Nothing anyone could do - rider injured in fatal crash,https://www.bbc.com/sport/motorsport/articles/cwy7ydkq9k1o,'Nothing anyone could do' to prevent fatal crash,"Morgan McLaren-Wood suffered a sprained wrist and bruising in the 11-rider crash Motorbike racer Morgan McLaren-Wood, who was injured in the crash which killed two fellow riders on Monday, says ""there was nothing anyone could do"" to prevent the tragedy. England's Owen Jenner, 21, and New Zealander Shane Richardson, 29, were fatally injured when 11 riders crashed during the British Supersport Championship race at Oulton Park in Cheshire. Another rider, Tom Tunstall, suffered a broken bone in his neck while five riders, including McLaren-Wood, sustained minor injuries and three escaped unharmed. ""I was maybe a row behind Shane and Owen, maybe five or six bikes behind them - maybe a bit more,"" McLaren-Wood, who suffered a sprained wrist and bruising around his back and knee, told BBC Sport. ""It was just chaos - there was nothing anyone could do. There were bikes everywhere. There was nowhere for anyone to go - it's such a tight track and there's not really any run-off on it either."" Tributes paid to two riders killed in motorcycle race Fatal Supersport crash - what happened and what next? Jenner and Richardson 'will never be forgotten' Richardson and McLaren-Wood forged a relationship in their homeland of New Zealand before both moved to the UK. McLaren-Wood said his compatriot helped him adjust to living in England and was always happy to offer advice about racing and life in general. Richardson was a joiner since the age of 16 and ran a joinery business alongside his racing career. He and his partner Hannah James have two children, Maddie and Max. ""Shane was such a lovely guy. After every race he'd always have a chat back in the pits, he'd ask me how my race went, I'd ask about his and he'd give me advice on how to get better and where to improve,"" McLaren-Wood said. ""He was such a loving dad. I can't imagine what they're going through right now, it's so sudden and unexpected."" McLaren-Wood said he did not know Jenner ""as much as I would have liked"". Jenner, from Crowborough in East Sussex, started his racing career in Junior Motorcross before progressing to the tarmac. He won the 2018 Team Green, 2020 Junior Supersport and 2023 Junior Superstock titles. Jenner joined the Kramer Team for the 2024 British GP2 season, winning the title with 18 wins out of 20 race finishes. Englishman Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson, of New Zealand, died in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire Fatalities are rare in motorbike racing, but unfortunately not unheard of. British Superbikes rider Chrissy Rouse died after a crash at Donington Park in 2022. Superbikes can reach speeds of up to 200mph, and the bikes used in Supersport regularly clock well in excess of 100mph. Former rider and MLav Racing owner Michael Laverty told BBC Sport that the riders were probably reaching speeds of ""about 90 to 100mph"" when they crashed on the opening corner of Oulton Park on the first lap. McLaren-Wood, who races for Josh Davis Motorsport By UGGLY & Co Kawasaki, expects the incident to impact some of the riders, but insisted they all enter the sport knowing the risks. ""I think it will affect a few people,"" McLaren-Wood said. ""Most of us out there know it's the sport we love to do and we will go out there fighting again, and avoid anything like that happening again."" Motorsport Vision Racing (MSV), who are responsible for circuit operations at Oulton Park, and the Motorcycle Racing Control Board (MCRCB) said on Monday they are ""investigating the full circumstances of the incident in conjunction with the Coroner and Cheshire Constabulary"". ""I think there are always ways to improve in safety in elite sport,"" McLaren-Wood said when asked what the sport could learn. ""Maybe there were too many riders out there, I don't really know. I'm not a safety expert, but I think it was mostly a tragedy."" The Oulton Park event marked the beginning of the 2025 British Superbikes season, with a further seven rounds set to take place across the UK before three 'showdown' events. The Supersport Championship is a support class to the main British Superbike series. The next event of the British Supersport Championship season takes place at Donington Park on 16-18 May.

Ronaldo's son gets first Portugal Under-15s call-up,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cm242ye9ppdo,Ronaldo's son gets first Portugal Under-15s call-up,"Cristiano Ronaldo and his son are both at Al-Nassr Cristiano's Ronaldo's eldest son has been called up to the Portugal Under-15s squad for the first time. The 14-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo Jr is at Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia with his father, who signed for the Pro League club in December 2022. Portugal great Ronaldo, 40, posted a picture on social media of his son's name on the national team squad list along with the message, ""Proud of you, son"". Ronaldo Jr has been called up for a youth tournament , external in Croatia between 13-18 May, with Portugal scheduled to play Japan, Greece and England. Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo Sr is still a Portugal international and has scored 136 goals for his country - a world record in men's football. The 40-year-old captained Portugal to their first major title at Euro 2016, although he had to agonisingly watch the majority of the final from the sidelines after suffering an injury in the 25th-minute. Ronaldo also led his national side to the Nations League title in 2019. In March, Ronaldo scored but missed a penalty as Portugal dramatically beat Denmark to reach the Nations League semi-finals. The ex-Manchester United forward has four other children - twins Eva and Mateo, 7, Alana Martina, 7, and Bella, 3. Ronaldo Jr's youth career has played out in tandem with his father's journey around the world - featuring in the academies of Real Madrid, Juventus, Manchester United and Al-Nassr. Reports claim , external he scored 58 goals in a season during his time with Italian giants Juventus. He played alongside Wayne Rooney's son, Kai, in the youth set-up at Manchester United when Ronaldo Sr returned for a second stint at Old Trafford. Videos of the teenager striking Ronaldo Sr's iconic 'Siu' celebration have gone viral while playing for Al-Nassr. Although he has been called-up by Portugal's under-15 side for next month's tournament, Ronaldo Jr is also eligible to play for his country of birth - the United States - or Spain due to residency when his father turned out for Real Madrid.

Real trying to sign Alexander-Arnold in time for Club World Cup,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1lm00mp1elo,Real seek to sign Alexander-Arnold for Club World Cup,"Alexander-Arnold won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with Liverpool Real Madrid are aiming to complete the signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold before the start of the Club World Cup. The England defender has confirmed he will leave Liverpool when his contract expires this summer and the 26-year-old is expected to join the Spanish club as a free agent. Alexander-Arnold's contract with Liverpool expires on 30 June but the Club World Cup begins 16 days earlier. BBC Sport understands Real have approached Liverpool with a view to negotiating a deal to release Alexander-Arnold in time for the full-back to be part of their plans for the Fifa-organised tournament in the United States. It is understood the Spanish club are considering an offer of about £850,000 to release Alexander-Arnold early from his deal. It has also been suggested Real might be willing to pay the wages Liverpool owe Alexander-Arnold as they seek a solution. Discussions between all parties are described as amicable. World football governing body Fifa has confirmed there will be a short initial transfer window this summer - running from 1 to 10 June - which is designed for clubs competing in the Club World Cup to amend their squads in time for the competition. Real's desire to land Alexander-Arnold in time for the tournament presents an opportunity for Liverpool to recoup at least some money for a high-value player who will otherwise leave Anfield for no fee.

'Calamity keeper' or 'human wall' - which Donnarumma will Arsenal face?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr5d9162g23o,'Calamity keeper' or 'human wall' - which Donnarumma will Arsenal face?,"Gianluigi Donnarumma made two superb saves to keep out Arsenal last week - this stop from Gabriel Martinelli, and another to deny Leandro Trossard A calamity keeper or the human wall? Arsenal's Champions League fate could be decided by which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France on Wednesday. Will they be thwarted again by the shot-stopper extraordinaire we saw in last week's semi-final first leg, when the giant Italian's long arms ensured Paris St-Germain escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win? Or could we see the return of the error-prone flapper who was left clutching at thin air as the Gunners scored from two crosses in a group-stage victory in October, where the 26-year-old put in the kind of unconvincing display that has put his entire future at the club in doubt? Arsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, so it probably doesn't help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign. His supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go. Still, if you support England, or even other English teams, you may be wondering why anyone doubts Donnarumma - after all, he has already been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season, and showed the world his prowess at stopping penalties when he helped Italy overcome the Three Lions in the shoot-out that settled the final of Euro 2020. Italy win in penalty shootout against England to become European champions He has performed plenty of heroics down the years, but PSG fans don't just remember Donnarumma for his big saves because, since he arrived on a free transfer from AC Milan in 2021, there have been plenty of bad errors too. In any case, much more is expected of a modern-day goalkeeper than just keeping the ball out of the net, and his distribution with his feet is seen as another weakness. So, does that drop him down the pecking order when we consider who is the best keeper on the planet, or is he just more proof that the perfect all-round player in his position does not exist? BBC Sport spoke to former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson about what makes Donnarumma special, and asked French football journalist Julien Laurens why PSG are considering replacing him this summer. Is Gianluigi Donnarumma's criticism justified? Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer Gianluigi Donnarumma saved two penalties in the shootout that saw PSG get past Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League At 6ft 5in, Donnarumma's sheer size makes him an imposing figure, physically. That clearly helps when he is facing a penalty - just ask Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Darwin Nunez or Curtis Jones - but it is where he puts his enormous frame when he is dealing with shots or onrushing strikers in open play that impresses Robinson more than anything else. ""He's massive, but his positional awareness in his box is excellent,"" Robinson told BBC Sport. ""That's down to the depth perception he has when he is reading a through ball and his understanding of where his line is. ""A lot of goalkeepers get sucked into rushing off their line to try to close down the angle and to close down the shot, and they think they are in a better position further away from the goal. It is something I did myself sometimes, and you find the shot is past you before you are ready. ""What Donnarumma does instead, very cleverly, is stay closer to his line, maybe two or three yards away. Because of his size he knows he can cover most of his goal from there anyway. ""The save he made low down with his left hand from Trossard's shot last week was the perfect example of that, and of him knowing exactly where he is in relation to his line. ""As Trossard runs into the box, if Donnarumma is three or four yards further forward, like a lot of goalkeepers would be, that shot goes past him. Instead, he holds his position, and makes the save on the angle. ""It is a brilliant save and it is his physique that allows him to make it, but also down to his technique and his positional awareness, which is second to none."" While his form has fluctuated, Donnarumma's contract situation is the main reason why his future is uncertain. He has one year left on the five-year deal he signed when he joined PSG, and has reportedly been in talks about an extension. According to his agent, Enzo Raiola, Donnarumma wants to stay - but he has been also been linked to a summer return to Serie A, and Milan, with Inter, while it appears PSG may have alternatives in mind too. ""The club are taking their time to decide what to do,"" explained French football journalist Laurens. ""They like Lucas Chevalier at Lille a lot and Luis Campos (PSG's football advisor in charge of recruitment) knows Chevalier well from when he was there."" Chevalier was reported to be one of Manchester United's targets before they signed Andre Onana as David de Gea's replacement. He helped Lille beat Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the group stage of this season's Champions League before the French side lost to Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 Chevalier, 23, is known for his passing proficiency as well as his saving ability and is seen as the future of French goalkeeping. He broke into the senior squad for the first time at the end of 2024, although he is yet to make his senior debut for Les Bleus. ""PSG have not made their minds up,"" added Laurens. ""Can they really get an upgrade on Donnarumma and, if so, is Chevalier that player? ""Any money they get for Donnarumma – maybe £25-30m - would be pure profit, but then it would probably cost around £50m to get Chevalier, so what do they do? ""The problem they have with Donnarumma is not on his line, where he is great - everyone at the club recognises that. It is just I think (PSG boss) Luis Enrique would rather have a good goalkeeper who is better with the ball at his feet. ""Still, it is a difficult decision. Of course it is ideal if you can get everything you need in a goalkeeper, but I am not sure Chevalier has everything yet."" PSG were in complete control of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022 until Benzema caught Donnarumma in possession and scored. He went on to score a 17-minute hat-trick to send Real into the quarter-finals It is Donnarumma's mistakes that have led some PSG fans to lose patience with him, and seen him targeted by the French media, with one performance in particular proving hard to forget. ""He got some criticism recently for Harvey Elliott's goal against Liverpool, which was bad, then he made a mistake when they lost to Nice too, when their first goal went under his arm,"" Laurens said. ""For a long time, though, he has been seen as just not being good enough at crosses or set-pieces. Kai Havertz put Arsenal ahead in their group-stage win over PSG in October, capitalising when Donnarumma failed to deal with a Leandro Trossard cross ""He has tried to work on that, just like he has tried to improve with the ball at his feet, but I don't see much of an improvement with any of his weaknesses. ""I think also he still carries with him his worst moment, the Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022. ""PSG were 1-0 up at the Bernabeu with 30 minutes to go after winning the first leg 1-0 too, but then Karim Benzema kind of barged into Donnarumma, got the ball off him and scored - and then Benzema scored two more goals quickly and PSG were out. ""A lot of fans remember that moment, and they feel that there is another mistake coming somewhere, but every time we see him doing well, that surely gets him more points to stay and have his contract extended than the other way around."" Donnarumma may have his detractors but the stats are on his side - new data ranks him higher than any other goalkeeper in the world. The CIES Football Observatory Index takes into account the level of games played plus results, and also measures the quality of chances faced at domestic level to look at the how the number of expected goals from those chances compare to how many were conceded. It places Donnarumma above Yann Sommer of Inter Milan and Real Madrid's Thibault Courtois at the top of a list which has a couple of notable omissions - Liverpool's Alisson and Manchester City's Ederson both fail to make the top 20. Donnarumma has won 72 caps for Italy and played 251 games for AC Milan before joining PSG in 2021. He has played 151 games all competitions for the French side, and has won Ligue 1 four times Robinson used a different criteria, including his eyes, to come up with an alternative top three where Alisson does appear, along with Donnarumma. ""For me, Alisson is the best in the world, because he hasn't forgotten the fundamentals of goalkeeping, which are to keep the ball out of the net,"" Robinson explained. ""Commanding your box, communicating with your back four, stopping shots and dealing with one on ones are all part of that, but he can adapt to the modern way of playing out from the back too, without taking it to the next level like Ederson does. ""Ederson is the best with his feet but for the all-round package there is Alisson, Jan Oblak at Atletico Madrid and Donnarumma, and you can put those three in the same bracket. ""To be the very best you need the right mindset too, and Donnarumma has that. He has played so many games since his debut for AC Milan aged 16 that he is much more experienced than most keepers his age. ""That maturity means he is comfortable on the biggest stage, and can make a difference the way he has done so many times already. ""There is this uncertainty about where he will be next year but I bet PSG are glad they have got him at the moment - if they go on to win the Champions League this season, he will play a huge part in that.""

Raducanu set-up 'working well' but jigsaw not complete,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cp3139wv6vno,Raducanu set-up 'working well' but jigsaw not complete,"Emma Raducanu is playing at the Italian Open for just the second time in her career Britain's Emma Raducanu believes her current coaching arrangement is working well but knows she will soon need to ""figure another solution out"". The 22-year-old still has a desire to develop a longer-term partnership with Mark Petchey, even if the pair were unable to agree a more exclusive arrangement. But Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) national women's coach who is alongside Petchey at this week's Italian Open, is only on a sabbatical from her current full-time job in finance. ""It's been working pretty well,"" Raducanu told BBC Sport in Rome. ""Mark is doing his commentary work and around that he is going to help me as much as he can and hopefully the times align that he can be there with me in the matches. ""That's why Jane is here for when he's not able to make it to the session. ""While she's not working it's nice to have her as much as possible, but she will go back to work and then I need to figure another solution out."" Sinner doping ban deal 'best choice in bad moment' How Draper has become a force on clay - Second Serve Sabalenka beats spirited Gauff to win Madrid Open The aim is to find someone who can act in a support role to Petchey, who has significant broadcast commitments throughout the year. ""I just need to work on who that person is,"" Raducanu added. However, former Great Britain number one Dan Evans cast doubt on the feasibility of Raducanu's arrangement with Petchey. ""It can't last if she starts losing matches and Petchey is in the commentary box. That's not going to work,"" Evans, 34, told 5 Live Tennis. ""I think Emma will be looking for a new coach again pretty soon if she starts to lose some matches on the grass into the US swing. I'm not sure how that can last as it is."" Petchey will be able to devote more time to Raducanu during the grass-court season, and the work they have been doing on the practice court is not purely targeted at clay courts. Raducanu lost to Marta Kostyuk in the Madrid Open second round in April and says she does not ""necessarily feel very comfortable"" on the surface. ""I feel slightly better than I did in Madrid,"" she said. ""I want to use this period of the clay season to try and work on certain things in my game that I think are going to help me bridge the gap to the next level. ""I want to take more balls on, I want to be more aggressive in certain points - I want to structure the points more on my terms. ""I know I may make more errors doing that, but I'm willing to go through that."" World number 49 Raducanu begins her Rome campaign against a qualifier on Wednesday. Raducanu also addressed how ""nervous"" she feels about the risk of ingesting contaminated medicine, or even being deliberately targeted when eating in a restaurant. Jannik Sinner returned to the ATP Tour this week after a three-month doping ban, having been inadvertently contaminated by a steroid cream his physiotherapist had applied to his own hands before treating the world number one. Women's world number two Iga Swiatek also served a one-month ban after testing positive after taking contaminated melatonin tablets. ""I don't want to take anything even if the doctors are saying you should take this - just out of risk of contamination,"" Raducanu added. ""Even if it's not prohibited on the anti-doping list, you don't know if it's contaminated by another product. ""It can show a green tick, but if it's contaminated you will still get screwed over. ""We could go to a restaurant [and someone could put something in our drink]. It's really hard, especially if you are noticeable and the waiter recognises you. ""It's something I do worry about - it's nervous every time.""

Learning from Pochettino & aiding Okocha - how PSG loan shaped Arteta,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyv7575qneo,Learning from Pochettino & aiding Okocha - how PSG loan shaped Arteta,"Mikel Arteta made 53 appearances for Paris St-Germain during an 18-month loan spell In January 2001 Mikel Arteta left Barcelona for Paris St-Germain in a move that would ultimately help transform one of the most intelligent midfielders of his generation into one of the game’s top coaches. It was where he first displayed the leadership qualities that have seen him progress to Arsenal manager and he will welcome PSG to Emirates Stadium on Tuesday in the Champions League. The 18-year-old Arteta, faced with the impossible task of usurping the likes of Pep Guardiola, French World Cup winner Emmanuel Petit, Dutch international Phillip Cocu and Xavi Hernandez in Barcelona’s star-studded midfield, had moved to the French capital on an 18-month loan deal. PSG were yet to become French football’s dominant force but had progressed to the second group stage of the Champions League and boasted several big names of their own, including Jay-Jay Okocha, Nicolas Anelka and Mauricio Pochettino. A young Brazilian by the name of Ronaldinho would join the club from Gremio later that year. Arteta barely spoke any French, but a small contingent of Spanish speakers helped him settle quickly into life in Ligue 1 and despite his tender years, the teenager made a big impression at the Parc des Princes. A young Arteta (3rd left) in training with his PSG team-mates One of the first players to take Arteta under his wing was Pochettino, who the Spaniard has since described as his “big brother” and “football father”. The Argentine, 10 years his senior, also arrived in January 2001 after leaving La Liga side Espanyol and struck up a close bond with his new team-mate as they shared a hotel for the first three months of their time in Paris. Arteta’s leadership skills, according to Pochettino, were apparent from the outset. “He was already a coach,” he said of his former PSG colleague in 2023. “He was giving advice to me and the others. [I’d] say ‘wow!’ – the character, the personality, the charisma. He already had the football brain.” Arteta grateful for early-career support from Pochettino Arteta was tasked by manager Luis Fernandez – who had already tried to sign the teenager while in charge of Athletic Bilbao – with orchestrating play from a deep-lying midfield position, a role he fulfilled with a confidence and maturity that belied his age. “Fernandez asked him to play simply and help provide a platform for more creative talents like Okocha, and he carried it out brilliantly,” French football expert Matt Spiro told BBC Sport. “Arteta was a quiet man but already displayed the steely determination we see in him today. Like most Barcelona players he was technically excellent, but the most surprising and impressive aspect of his game, given his age, was his tactical awareness.” Arteta made 11 appearances before the end of the campaign, scoring his first PSG goal in a 2-2 draw with Lille on the season’s penultimate weekend. Despite his fine start, however, Fernandez’s side ended that term in inauspicious fashion. After losing 4-0 to Auxerre in the French Cup fourth round – Arteta’s debut for the club – they finished bottom of their second-round group in the Champions League and only narrowly clinched a top-half finish on the final day of the season. But better times were just around the corner. Arteta: The making of Mikel PSG manager Luis Fernandez (left) had tried to sign Arteta (right) during his time in charge of Athletic Bilbao Victory in that summer’s Intertoto Cup earned Les Parisiens a place in the first round proper of the 2001-02 Uefa Cup. Including those early-season European games, PSG won eight and drew 10 of their first 18 matches of the campaign, eventually suffering their first defeat at Bordeaux on the final day of September. Arteta played the full 90 minutes in all but one of his 16 league appearances before Christmas, as PSG placed themselves firmly in the mix for a return to the Champions League the following season. “The team had style on the pitch,” Fernandez, who remembers Arteta as a player with “good etiquette and behaviour”, told The Athletic last year. “They always met my expectations in relation to the system and the organisation. We were able to make them evolve and grow as players. I am happy to have been able to help them, and Mikel.” PSG would again fall short in France’s domestic cup competitions, losing in the French Cup quarter-finals and League Cup semi-finals to Lorient and Bordeaux respectively. But it was a penalty-shootout defeat by Rangers in the Uefa Cup round of 32 that would prove costly in more ways than one, as it marked the beginning of the end of Arteta’s time at the club. The Glasgow outfit, who knew little of the teenager before the first-leg meeting in late November, were so impressed by his performance across both matches that they decided to offer Barcelona – who by that time had Andres Iniesta knocking on the first-team door – £6m for his services. Fernandez had reportedly made the permanent acquisition of Arteta one of his top priorities, but despite holding a purchase option for the midfielder, PSG were beaten to his signature by Alex McLeish’s side, who agreed a deal in March for Arteta to join in the summer. Arteta on ‘survive or die’ at Rangers Arteta caught the eye of the Rangers hierarchy during a Uefa Cup meeting in late 2001 Confirmation of his imminent departure did little to sour Arteta’s relationship with the fans at PSG, who ended their Ligue 1 campaign in fourth spot – insufficient for a Champions League return but a marked improvement on ninth the previous year, and enough at least to guarantee Uefa Cup football for another season. Arteta ended 2001-02 on 42 appearances in all competitions, his modest return of eight goal involvements misrepresentative of the overall impact he had during his loan spell. As PSG supporters prepare to travel to Emirates Stadium on 1 October, conversations among a certain vintage may turn to their former midfield orchestrator who, in the intervening decades, has blossomed into one of the brightest tactical minds in the game. “Arteta was a major success during his 18 months at PSG,” said Spiro. “Everybody was disappointed they didn’t manage to keep him longer. “They didn’t win any trophies, but fans still recall that period – and Arteta – with great fondness.” Latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views Get Arsenal news sent straight to your phone Champions League reaction as Inter beat Barcelona in thriller to reach final 'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end 'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls Preview the forthcoming drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103 Watchlist Add BBC Trailers to your Watchlist in iPlayer A gritty crime saga set in Liverpool starring Sean Bean Watchlist Add This City Is Ours to your Watchlist in iPlayer Stacey Dooley explores Britain’s shoplifting epidemic Watchlist Add Stacey Dooley to your Watchlist in iPlayer Rock group, Jethro Tull, at home, in the studio and on tour Watchlist Add The Lively Arts to your Watchlist in iPlayer 'A liability', 'the aura' & 'a phenomenon' - the big Lions calls Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?

Inter beat Barca in all-time classic to reach Champions League final,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/crrz42r8ve4t,Inter beat Barca in all-time classic to reach Champions League final,"Inter Milan match-winner Davide Frattesi came on as a 79th-minute substitute for Henrikh Mkhitaryan Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of added time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie, the 37-year-old charging around with his shirt off in wild celebrations. And there were more ecstatic scenes when substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra time before climbing up a security fence to celebrate in front of Inter's fans. It means a second Champions League final in three seasons for three-time European champions Inter after two legs of incredible drama which saw 13 goals and a tie turned on its head on several occasions. Barca were only two minutes away from their first final in 10 years having fought back from 2-0 down - in a similar scenario to the first leg - to lead 3-2 on the night. Lamine Yamal almost took the game to penalties but was twice denied by superb saves by Yann Sommer as Inter held on to reach the final and spark incredible scenes of celebration. Inter, who lost 1-0 to Manchester City in the 2023 final, will play either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday, 31 May in the 2025 showpiece. The Gunners head into Wednesday's second leg in France after losing 1-0 at Emirates Stadium last week. 'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals? Lautaro Martinez scored his ninth goal in this season's Champions League, the most by any Inter Milan player in an edition of the competition, overtaking Samuel Eto'o in 2011 (eight goals) This semi-final will go down as one of the best in the tournament's history. Just like in the first leg in Spain, Inter raced into a 2-0 lead, only to be pegged by Barcelona. After Lautaro Martinez had put Inter ahead following good work from team-mate Denzel Dumfries, Hakan Calhanoglu converted a penalty at the end of the first half to leave Barcelona 5-3 behind on aggregate and in massive trouble. But Hansi Flick's side dominated the second half. Former Manchester City defender Eric Garcia volleyed one back for Barcelona before Dani Olmo's fine diving header in the 60th minute from Gerard Martin's cross made it 2-2 on the night and 5-5 on aggregate. Raphinha grabbed what appeared to be an 87th-minute winner as Barca went ahead for the first time in the tie, when he converted a rebound after Sommer had saved his first strike. Inter saved themselves, although Yamal had a chance to win the tie in the sixth minute of stoppage time only for Sommer to make a vital stop. The hosts then retook the lead in extra time, but Barca still created chances, only for substitute Robert Lewandowski to head over and for 17-year-old Yamal to be denied by Sommer's superb one-handed save. This tie was the joint-highest scoring semi-final tie in the Champions League history, matching the 13 goals scored when Liverpool defeated Roma 7-6 on aggregate in 2017-18. Inter Milan fans displayed a colourful and spectacular tifo around the San Siro before the match started Lamine Yamal was seven years old when Barcelona were last European champions Inter won the European Cup in 1964 and 1965 and clinched the Champions League in 2010, when Jose Mourinho guided them to a 2-0 win in the final against Bayern Munich. No Italian side has won the competition since then with Juventus losing in the 2015 and 2017 finals, before Rodri scored the only goal for Manchester City against Inter in the final two years ago. Simone Inzaghi was Inter's manager then and he has again plotted a route to the final, while also taking them in contention to win a second successive Italian Serie A title as they are second, three points behind leaders Napoli with three games to go. Meanwhile, Barcelona have been European champions five times, but have not reached the final since their last success in 2015. They still have a chance to grab their third domestic trophy this season as they hold a four-point lead at the top of La Liga over reigning champions Real Madrid. Barca entertain Real in El Clasico on Sunday and a victory would go a long way to securing a 28th Spanish title - and only their second in the past six campaigns. Flick's side have already won the Copa del Rey and the Supercopa de Espana this season, beating Real in both finals.

Kvitova seals first win of comeback at Italian Open,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c3wxwelqly0o,Kvitova seals first win of comeback at Italian Open,"Petra Kvitova won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014 Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova won her first match since the birth of her first child, then said she had been close to quitting tennis. The Czech claimed a 7-5 6-1 win over Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round of the Italian Open in Rome. Her victory ended a run of four defeats since the 35-year-old returned to competitive action after 15 months away during which she gave birth to her son Petr. Kvitova, who won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014 and reached number two in the world, said she had doubted whether she would return to the international arena. ""I was 95% that I would never come back. I had enough of tennis at that time. I was like, 'I can't do it any more' - so we decided to try for a baby,"" she told the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) website. ""I didn't say anything because it wasn't 100%. When I could do something finally after pregnancy, I played some tennis and it felt so good. I was laughing. Every shot I hit smoothly, I was like, 'Wow - it's still there'."" Kvitova will now play world number 36 Ons Jabeur of Tunisia in the second round of the tournament played on the clay courts of the Foro Italico. Great Britain's Sonay Kartal fought back from a set down to book her place in the second round at the expense of Kimberly Birrell. Kartal saw off the Australian 4-6 6-3 6-4 in a gruelling match which lasted two hours and 10 minutes. The 23-year-old, who was ranked outside the world's top 250 a year ago but is now up to number 56, will play 30th seed Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic next. British number three Kartal won her only WTA tour title at the Jasmin Open in Tunisia last year. Meanwhile, Cameron Norrie was beaten by Dusan Lajovic of Serbia in three sets in qualifying but was handed a place in the main draw as one of three lucky losers. Norrie struggled during a one-sided opening set which Lajovic won 6-1, but rallied and took the second 6-4 to level the contest. The British number three lost the deciding set 6-3, only to get a reprieve later in the day after Zizou Bergs, Jan-Lennard Struff and Benjamin Bonzi all withdrew through injury. Norrie will face world number 81 Christopher O'Connell of Australia.
