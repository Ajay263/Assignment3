With the Mariners trailing by one, Jorge Polanco drew a one-out walk from reliever Tyler Ferguson (0-1) in the ninth.

Valkyries fall short in second half comeback losing 83-82 against Sparks The Valkyries showed they have some grit in their first-ever game after mounting a comeback in the second half of their preseason match-up against the Sparks. 7H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/valkyries-sparks-preseason-game-2025-first-ever-game/,Valkyries fall short after unsuccessful second half comeback losing 83-82 to Sparks in first-ever game,"In their first-ever game, the Golden State Valkyries lost to the Los Angeles Sparks 83-82 after mounting a strong but unsuccessful comeback with the help of Laeticia Amihere, who scored 20 points. Tiffany Hayes, Veronica Burton, Kayla Thornton, Monique Billings and Temi Fagbenle took to the court as the Valkyries' first-ever starting lineup during their preseason game. It was Natalie Nakase's first game as a WNBA head coach, and she made history becoming the WNBA's first Asian American head coach. The Sparks took an early lead in the matchup off a layup by All-WNBA player Kelsey Plum. The Valkyries quickly got on the board after Hayes connected with Billings for 2 points. Golden State cut the lead to 6-5, but the Sparks pulled ahead, going on a 6-0 run. The Valkyries finished the first quarter trailing 16-13. The Sparks pulled ahead going into halftime with a commanding 39-25 lead. The first half was a battle in the paint. Both teams scored more than half their points from in the paint. Golden State scored 14 while Los Angeles scored 26. Billings had a strong first half with 7 rebounds and 7 points. Thornton, who came off a championship-winning season with the New York Liberty, had 4 rebounds and 6 points. They took the majority of the shots, alongside Hayes. Kate Martin, who was the 2024 Sixth Woman of the Year, Carla Leite, Julie Vanloo and Laeticia Amihere, combined for 7 first-half points off the bench. The Valkyries got off to a hot start in the third quarter with a 3-pointer by Thornton, kicking off an 11-2 run to bring Golden State within 2. The Sparks began to pull away again, taking a 54 to 45 lead with just over two minutes left in the third quarter. Then, the Valkyries went on their best run of the game, tying the game at 54-54 with 38 seconds left. The Sparks responded with a 3-pointer, which the Valkyries quickly matched as Kyara Linskens connected with Amihere for a 3-pointer with less than five seconds left to enter the final quarter 57-57. The Valkyries outscored the Spark 32-18 in the third quarter. The Sparks scored the first basket in the fourth quarter and never let the lead go. Amihere scored the Valkyries' first points in the final quarter and helped keep them within single digits of the Sparks. A steal by Vanloo got the Valkyries within one point after she threw a dime to Kaitlyn Chen on the fast break, bringing the score to 66-67, with 5 minutes left in the game. The Valkyries had a strong second half but fell short, losing by 1 point after a buzzer-beater by Amihere brought the final score to 83-82.

"Warriors take Game 1 from Wolves 99-88 Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Golden State star Stephen Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and the Warriors opened the second-round series with an inspired 99-88 victory over the Timberwolves. 8H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/warriors-take-game-1-from-wolves/,Wolves struggle to keep up with the Warriors in Game 1 despite Curry's departure,"Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Golden State star Stephen Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and the Warriors opened the second-round series with an inspired 99-88 victory over the stumbling Timberwolves on Tuesday night. Hield picked up where he left off in the Game 7 win at Houston that finished the first round by scoring 24 points on 5-for-8 3-point shooting. Jimmy Butler had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and Green had four first-half 3s on his way to 18 points, as the Warriors used 12 players, plenty of hustle and lockdown defense to overcome the concerning departure of their sharpshooting leader. The home teams have yet to win in the second round of these NBA playoffs. Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday. The big question: Will Curry will be available? The league's career leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that. Warriors coach Steve Kerr shrewdly sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off. The Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter. Anthony Edwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after a particularly rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA","May 6, 2025 / 9:29 PM PDT / AP",N/A

"Sharks to pick 2nd in 2025 NHL Draft following last-place finish The New York Islanders won the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vaulted nine teams, including the last-place San Jose Sharks, in winning the opportunity to have the No. 1 pick. MAY 6",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/2025-nhl-draft-lottery-san-jose-sharks-2nd-pick/,Sharks to pick 2nd in 2025 NHL Draft following last-place finish,"New York Islanders pro scouting director Ken Morrow knows a thing or two about so-called hockey miracles. Witnessing the Islanders win the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vault nine other teams in the order for the right to have the No. 1 pick represented yet another memorable moment for the four-time Stanley Cup champion and member of the 1980 gold-medal-winning ""Miracle on Ice"" U.S. Olympic team. ""I've had a lot of thrills in my hockey life, but this is right up there at the top,"" Morrow said. ""The hockey gods smiled on us. I can't tell you how thrilled I am for Islanders fans, for our ownership, for the entire Islanders organization."" The Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, are in the midst of a front-office shakeup after not renewing general manager Lou Lamoriello's contract on April 22. And they earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot — the 10th-best odds — of seeing their numbers come up. New York wasn't the only team to buck the lottery odds. The Utah Hockey Club won the second round of the lottery, and made the jump from 14th to fourth under the rules limiting teams from moving up no more than 10 spots in the draft order. ""A couple of seconds ago, we were just like 10 back, so it still hasn't sunk in,"" Utah GM Bill Armstrong said of a first-year franchise that finished just seven points out of a playoff spot. ""This is an exciting moment for us. It's a game-changer for us."" The San Jose Sharks will pick second after entering the day with the best odds, 18.5%, to win the lottery and a 25.5% chance of landing the No. 1 choice. San Jose, which finished last for a second consecutive year, was seeking to become the NHL's first team to win the lottery and pick first in consecutive years. ""We definitely lucked it out last year to be able to select Mac,"" Sharks GM Mike Grier said in referring to selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall. ""This year would have obviously been nice to have the pick and have the choice of all the players. But picking two, we're still in a pretty good spot so we're happy."" The Chicago Blackhawks had the second-best chances to win the lottery and will pick third. The remaining 12 teams moved two spots back in the order, starting with Nashville dropping from third to fifth. The final 16 draft spots will be determined following the playoffs. The Islanders have the right to pick first for the fifth time in team history, and first since selecting John Tavares with the No. 1 choice in 2009. This year's draft will be held in Los Angeles with the first round taking place on June 27, followed by the final six rounds the next day. Top prospects will convene for the weeklong predraft combine being held in Buffalo next month. The prospect pool is not considered as deep at the top as last year's class, or next year's group, with Canadian junior forward Gavin McKenna long regarded as the No. 1 candidate. Erie Otters defenseman Matthew Schaefer is NHL Central Scouting's top-ranked North American prospect followed by OHL Saginaw center Michael Misa and Boston College center James Hagens, the top-ranked U.S. born prospect. Hagens is from Long Island and grew up an Islanders fan. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 183 pounds, Schaefer maintained his No. 1 position despite missing the final three months of the season after breaking his right collarbone representing Canada at the world junior championships in December. Schaefer has the potential of becoming only the fifth defenseman selected No. 1 since 2000, and first since Buffalo chose Owen Power in 2021. And he also has the chance of being the first OHL player to go No. 1 since Edmonton drafted Erie's Connor McDavid in 2015. The top-ranked international skaters are center Anton Frondell and right wing Victor Eklund, who are teammates with Djurgarden of Sweden's second division league. New York's jump from 10th to first is the biggest involving a team winning the No. 1 selection. And it comes after the last-place team won the lottery to retain the first pick in four of the past five years and 12 times overall since the NHL launched the format in 1995. The New York Rangers enjoyed the previous largest move up to No. 1 in 2020, when they were grouped among eight teams — ranked eighth to 15th — with the same odds to win the lottery after being eliminated in the COVID-altered play-in round of the expanded 24-team playoff format. The lottery was held at the NHL Network studios in New Jersey, and conducted live for the first time in the event's 30-year history. Previously, the lottery was held shortly before the broadcast in front of a limited audience of sequestered observers, followed by the draft selections being revealed in reverse order.","Updated on: May 6, 2025 / 12:16 AM PDT / AP",N/A

Wilson finished with three hits and three RBIs, including a tying single against Mariners closer Andrés Muñoz leading off the 10th that scored automatic runner JJ Bleday. The Athletics then loaded the bases with nobody out, but Muñoz struck out the next three batters and still has not allowed an earned run this season. One inning later, a sacrifice bunt by Gio Urshela and two intentional walks loaded the bases for Wilson.

It was Wilson's third walk-off hit in 62 major league games and second this season. Hogan Harris (1-0) got the win with a scoreless 11th. Miguel Andujar's sacrifice fly in the first and Wilson's RBI single in the second staked the Athletics to a 2-0 lead.

Shea Langeliers led off the fourth with his eighth homer and Lawrence Butler tied it with a two-out RBI single. Langeliers' sacrifice fly off Collin Snider in the seventh gave the Athletics a 5-4 advantage. Cal Raleigh drew a walk from Grant Holman in the eighth and scored on a two-out single by Williamson to tie it. Seattle starter Bryce Miller allowed four runs and seven hits in four innings. Severino permitted four runs on five hits and four walks in six innings. Athletics closer Mason Miller walked two in the ninth before coming back to strike out Raleigh for the third out.

Oakland LGBTQ nightclub holds fundraiser to raise money after recent burglary,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/oakland-lgbtq-nightclub-holds-fundraiser-to-raise-money-after-recent-burglary/,Oakland LGBTQ nightclub holds fundraiser to raise money after recent burglary,"OAKLAND — An Oakland LGBTQ nightclub is trying to do what it can to recover after a recent burglary. On Tuesday, tables filled Que Rico nightclub for a taco fundraiser, an attempt to turn the break-in, into a bounce back. Rick Hernandez Graham lives in Castro Valley and doesn't come into Oakland as much anymore, but he did for this event. ""It all just kinda fell into place,"" said Hernandez Graham. But a last-minute personal matter brought him into town and he remembered a social media post about ""Tacos for a Cause."" ""We were on our way up here, and I thought today is the taco benefit today too, so I thought we'd do both at once,"" said Hernandez Graham. Que Rico is trying to cover the $5,000 in damage and thousands more in alcohol lost during a break-in on April 29. Video from the most recent break-in shows the suspects moving around the back room and then disabling a camera. Hernandez Graham worries this bar continues to be targets because it is the only LGBTQ Latin Club in Northern California. ""There are people that have walked around their whole lives with a target on their back. All we can do is protect them, all we can do is support them, and when they fall, pick them up,"" explained Hernandez Graham. Que Rico Owner Valentino Carrillo said it is the 11th time his business has been broken into, and it only opened in 2021. ""Over four years that we've been broken into during that time, I estimate we lost over $100,000,"" said Carrillo. He said it's starting to impact every part of the business. ""It definitely affects staff morale, salaries, upgrades we want to do to the bar, community events that we do,"" Carrillo detailed. A long-term lease at their downtown location near Franklin and 15th street means the business can't just move. ""It's very frustrating, there's very little we can do,"" explained Carrillo. ""We've fortified the place, we make a lot of changes but every time they figure out a way to keep coming."" But customers like Hernandez Graham keep coming too. They plan to keep supporting to help offset the costs of the break-ins and hopefully find a solution. ""If we don't, they close down,"" said Hernandez Graham about why he will continue to support this business and ones like it.","May 6, 2025 / 11:47 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco",N/A
Orinda neighborhood paid for its own license plate reader cameras to deter crime,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/orinda-neighborhood-paid-for-its-own-license-plate-reader-cameras-to-deter-crime/,Orinda neighborhood paid for its own license plate reader cameras to deter crime,"Residents in one East Bay community got so fed up with the number of burglaries and break-ins that they took matters into their own hands, paying to install their own license plate reader cameras. Now, those same residents are asking the city of Orinda to pick up the tab on their cameras and add 15 more. Evan Dreyer said there are at least a dozen neighbors who have surveillance video of burglars casing houses or breaking into homes in the Knickerbocker neighborhood of Orinda. ""This is something that in this neighborhood we dealt with personally, not only myself but other people,"" he said. Dreyer said his home in Orinda was broken into in January 2024, and after that, he and his family no longer felt safe. ""We understand that getting city governments and city budgets to do things sometimes can take time. This wasn't something we could wait around on so we wanted to lead by example,"" he said. Dreyer sent out emails to a bunch of his neighbors and asked if they'd be interested in paying for their own license plate reader cameras. In just a few days, he got 30 families to sign on. They installed 2 Flock cameras at the main entrances to the neighborhood at a cost of a little over $11,000 for a two-year contract, which came out to about $400 per family. ""Like this car right here that's coming down right now, for example. It's going to automatically turn on, take a picture of this license plate, and if that car was a vehicle that was wanted, by the police, it would automatically give them an alert so they will now know, oh, he just crossed by Stein Way and they can do something,"" explained Dreyer. At the meeting on Tuesday night, the Orinda City Council is considering not only picking up the contract on the two cameras Evan and his neighbors paid for but also adding another 15 more. Privacy advocates have raised concerns in general about these license plate reader cameras because almost every law enforcement agency in the area can get access to the data. ""What is the information being used for? And why is it OK for people's license plates to be captured indiscriminately by law enforcement when people driving down the road are really not breaking any laws,"" said Karen Gullo with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In Orinda, that hasn't seemed to slow down deployment. The city currently has a total of 19 cameras, and of those, only 7 were installed by the city. The other 12 were installed by neighborhood groups or HOAs. ""I want to keep my neighbors and my neighborhood safe. Absolutely,"" said Scott Johnson. He said his HOA already paid for a camera at the entrance to their community. Johnson said while he thinks the city should pick up the tab, he's willing to foot the bill if necessary. ""Fix the roads and fix the lights. Yes, we'd all like to see society work better, but a lot of our municipalities really don't seem to be following through,"" he said.

Warriors take Game 1 from Wolves 99-88,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/warriors-take-game-1-from-wolves/,Wolves struggle to keep up with the Warriors in Game 1 despite Curry's departure,"Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Golden State star Stephen Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and the Warriors opened the second-round series with an inspired 99-88 victory over the stumbling Timberwolves on Tuesday night. Hield picked up where he left off in the Game 7 win at Houston that finished the first round by scoring 24 points on 5-for-8 3-point shooting. Jimmy Butler had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and Green had four first-half 3s on his way to 18 points, as the Warriors used 12 players, plenty of hustle and lockdown defense to overcome the concerning departure of their sharpshooting leader. The home teams have yet to win in the second round of these NBA playoffs. Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday. The big question: Will Curry will be available? The league's career leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that. Warriors coach Steve Kerr shrewdly sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off. The Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter. Anthony Edwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after a particularly rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA","May 6, 2025 / 9:29 PM PDT / AP",N/A
Bay Area startup helps college students cut down on rent costs by doing chores,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/startup-helps-college-students-cut-down-on-rent-costs-by-doing-chores/,Bay Area startup helps college students cut down on rent costs by doing chores,"A Bay Area startup is taking a different approach in an attempt to help solve the housing crisis by using a matchmaking platform to connect college students and homeowners. When most students have called it a day, Nanik Tagore is just getting started. A shooting guard for the Dominican University men's basketball team, he's got range, control and a shot that rarely misses. But when it came time to find housing in the Bay Area, he was out of his league. ""San Rafael is one of the most expensive places to live,"" Tagore said. ""So, I wasn't sure how I was going to be able to live on my own."" That's when he came across a new startup called Joey — a platform that matches students with homeowners who need a little help around the house. Tagore now pays $1,700 for a room in Marin County. But he works off about $500 of that doing chores that don't show up on a resume but say a lot about a person: walking the dog, sorting the mail, taking out the trash, even making lunch. Because of employment regulations, renters in the Joey program pay full rent upfront, then get reimbursed for the hours they work — a workaround designed to stay compliant with labor laws. He now lives with Paige and Jason Miller, a couple who could use the help. Jason is a full-time caregiver. Paige Miller is living with early-stage dementia. She can't drive, and Jason works long hours running a company. ""My worry actually was Paige,"" Jason Miller said. ""Would she feel comfortable having somebody else live in the house?"" Turns out, she was more than comfortable. ""It gives me back my freedom,"" Paige Miller said. ""And he's great to have around. He laughs at my jokes."" With roughly 60% of U.S. homes containing at least one spare bedroom, Joey's founder Alison Donnally sees untapped potential. ""It just didn't make sense to me why we couldn't have something similar to an au pair, but for older adults,"" she said. Tagore is the first person to be placed through the app, but Donnally said applications are already being processed. ""What we can do at JoeyCo is create more bedroom inventory for these students,"" she said. As for Tagore, he said he's found more than just a place to stay. ""It doesn't feel like work,"" he said. ""It doesn't feel like a chore to lend a helping hand.""","May 6, 2025 / 6:50 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco",N/A

Tiffany Hayes, Veronica Burton, Kayla Thornton, Monique Billings and Temi Fagbenle took to the court as the Valkyries' first-ever starting lineup during their preseason game. It was Natalie Nakase's first game as a WNBA head coach, and she made history becoming the WNBA's first Asian American head coach. The Sparks took an early lead in the matchup off a layup by All-WNBA player Kelsey Plum. The Valkyries quickly got on the board after Hayes connected with Billings for 2 points. Golden State cut the lead to 6-5, but the Sparks pulled ahead, going on a 6-0 run. The Valkyries finished the first quarter trailing 16-13. The Sparks pulled ahead going into halftime with a commanding 39-25 lead. The first half was a battle in the paint. Both teams scored more than half their points from in the paint. Golden State scored 14 while Los Angeles scored 26. Billings had a strong first half with 7 rebounds and 7 points. Thornton, who came off a championship-winning season with the New York Liberty, had 4 rebounds and 6 points. They took the majority of the shots, alongside Hayes. Kate Martin, who was the 2024 Sixth Woman of the Year, Carla Leite, Julie Vanloo and Laeticia Amihere, combined for 7 first-half points off the bench. The Valkyries got off to a hot start in the third quarter with a 3-pointer by Thornton, kicking off an 11-2 run to bring Golden State within 2. The Sparks began to pull away again, taking a 54 to 45 lead with just over two minutes left in the third quarter. Then, the Valkyries went on their best run of the game, tying the game at 54-54 with 38 seconds left. The Sparks responded with a 3-pointer, which the Valkyries quickly matched as Kyara Linskens connected with Amihere for a 3-pointer with less than five seconds left to enter the final quarter 57-57. The Valkyries outscored the Spark 32-18 in the third quarter. The Sparks scored the first basket in the fourth quarter and never let the lead go. Amihere scored the Valkyries' first points in the final quarter and helped keep them within single digits of the Sparks. A steal by Vanloo got the Valkyries within one point after she threw a dime to Kaitlyn Chen on the fast break, bringing the score to 66-67, with 5 minutes left in the game. The Valkyries had a strong second half but fell short, losing by 1 point after a buzzer-beater by Amihere brought the final score to 83-82.

That is good news for Seth Chandler, owner of Witter Coin in San Francisco who seeing more people come into his store to buy and sell gold. ""When you have a one-ounce gold coin in your hand, it feels very heavy, it feels like real money,"" said Chandler.

Joe Halpern, Chief Investment Officer of Fountainhead says, the recent interest in gold can be tied to the volatility in the stock market, since the start of the Trump Administration. ""It has been going up for a while now for over the last year. But you really saw lift after Liberation Day on April 2nd. At first gold moved down with the whole market, but then it increased dramatically,"" said Halpern. ""And gold is really a flight to safety. So, when people are nervous, they tend to sell out of those risky assets like an Apple or a Microsoft, and they go into Treasury or gold.""

Meanwhile for Chandler, while he does not give out investment advice, he understands people's fascination with physical gold.

Woman who lived on Alcatraz as a child talks about her experience,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/woman-who-lived-on-alcatraz-as-a-child-talks-about-her-experience/,Woman who lived on Alcatraz as a child talks about her experience,"SAN FRANCISCO —People are continuing to react after President Donald Trump said Sunday he is directing his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz. The prison was open for about three decades, closing in 1963. About 1,500 prisoners lived on the island, but there were also about 60 families of staff members living there as well, including Jolene Babyak. ""You know, for kids, it was absolutely wonderful,"" said Babyak about her time on the island. ""There were about 75 children on the island."" Babyak's father worked as an administrator and later an associate warden. They lived on the island in the 50s, when she was just 7 to 9 years old, and then again when she was 15. It was separated into two sides, on the side she was on, it was child-centered and community-oriented with things like Halloween parties, dances and bowling leagues. ""It was very, very comfortable,"" Babyak emphasized. ""Low-crime neighborhood, I always like to say. The prisoners were focused on the opposite of the island and the escapes, we're in that direction, and we lived in our neighborhood and they never really came down and tried to escape from that area."" She said that when her father came home, he never shared stories about the dark side of his time working in the prison. ""Usually, the officers like to tell the funnier stories, and not the grim stabbings and such. We didn't hear about that too much,"" said Babyak. But those things did happen. It was a maximum security, minimum-privilege prison opened to deal with the most hardened inmates in the federal prison system. It closed in 1963. Now, it's a national park that more than a million people from all over the world visit it each year. Valentina Forat was visiting with her family from Mexico. ""We got to get in the cells and it was shivery,"" Valentina Forat explained. Her brother, Lucas Forat, said he wanted to learn about its history, a history he doesn't think should be repeated. ""I would not prefer to open it,"" said Lucas Forat. ""I think the prisons that are already here in the United States are very good, and we're good without it."" In her adulthood, Babyak has continued to learn about Alcatraz, interviewing prisoners and officers, and writing a book. She doesn't believe it would be feasible to reopen it. ""It would be very, very expensive,"" said Babyak. ""The building itself was ancient 62 years ago. It doesn't have the infrastructure. Water and sewage being the biggest problems."" It's not just the expense of upgrades, but also of operation. It closed because it was too expensive, all of it's supplies like, food, fuel, and fresh water, had to be delivered by boat. ""I think we have much more sophisticated prisons now,"" explained Babyak. ""You'd really have to come in and completely re-build the prison.""","May 5, 2025 / 11:44 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco",N/A
Oakland LGBTQ nightclub holds fundraiser to raise money after recent burglary,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/oakland-lgbtq-nightclub-holds-fundraiser-to-raise-money-after-recent-burglary/,Oakland LGBTQ nightclub holds fundraiser to raise money after recent burglary,"OAKLAND — An Oakland LGBTQ nightclub is trying to do what it can to recover after a recent burglary. On Tuesday, tables filled Que Rico nightclub for a taco fundraiser, an attempt to turn the break-in, into a bounce back. Rick Hernandez Graham lives in Castro Valley and doesn't come into Oakland as much anymore, but he did for this event. ""It all just kinda fell into place,"" said Hernandez Graham. But a last-minute personal matter brought him into town and he remembered a social media post about ""Tacos for a Cause."" ""We were on our way up here, and I thought today is the taco benefit today too, so I thought we'd do both at once,"" said Hernandez Graham. Que Rico is trying to cover the $5,000 in damage and thousands more in alcohol lost during a break-in on April 29. Video from the most recent break-in shows the suspects moving around the back room and then disabling a camera. Hernandez Graham worries this bar continues to be targets because it is the only LGBTQ Latin Club in Northern California. ""There are people that have walked around their whole lives with a target on their back. All we can do is protect them, all we can do is support them, and when they fall, pick them up,"" explained Hernandez Graham. Que Rico Owner Valentino Carrillo said it is the 11th time his business has been broken into, and it only opened in 2021. ""Over four years that we've been broken into during that time, I estimate we lost over $100,000,"" said Carrillo. He said it's starting to impact every part of the business. ""It definitely affects staff morale, salaries, upgrades we want to do to the bar, community events that we do,"" Carrillo detailed. A long-term lease at their downtown location near Franklin and 15th street means the business can't just move. ""It's very frustrating, there's very little we can do,"" explained Carrillo. ""We've fortified the place, we make a lot of changes but every time they figure out a way to keep coming."" But customers like Hernandez Graham keep coming too. They plan to keep supporting to help offset the costs of the break-ins and hopefully find a solution. ""If we don't, they close down,"" said Hernandez Graham about why he will continue to support this business and ones like it.","May 6, 2025 / 11:47 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco",N/A
Orinda neighborhood paid for its own license plate reader cameras to deter crime,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/orinda-neighborhood-paid-for-its-own-license-plate-reader-cameras-to-deter-crime/,Orinda neighborhood paid for its own license plate reader cameras to deter crime,"Residents in one East Bay community got so fed up with the number of burglaries and break-ins that they took matters into their own hands, paying to install their own license plate reader cameras. Now, those same residents are asking the city of Orinda to pick up the tab on their cameras and add 15 more. Evan Dreyer said there are at least a dozen neighbors who have surveillance video of burglars casing houses or breaking into homes in the Knickerbocker neighborhood of Orinda. ""This is something that in this neighborhood we dealt with personally, not only myself but other people,"" he said. Dreyer said his home in Orinda was broken into in January 2024, and after that, he and his family no longer felt safe. ""We understand that getting city governments and city budgets to do things sometimes can take time. This wasn't something we could wait around on so we wanted to lead by example,"" he said. Dreyer sent out emails to a bunch of his neighbors and asked if they'd be interested in paying for their own license plate reader cameras. In just a few days, he got 30 families to sign on. They installed 2 Flock cameras at the main entrances to the neighborhood at a cost of a little over $11,000 for a two-year contract, which came out to about $400 per family. ""Like this car right here that's coming down right now, for example. It's going to automatically turn on, take a picture of this license plate, and if that car was a vehicle that was wanted, by the police, it would automatically give them an alert so they will now know, oh, he just crossed by Stein Way and they can do something,"" explained Dreyer. At the meeting on Tuesday night, the Orinda City Council is considering not only picking up the contract on the two cameras Evan and his neighbors paid for but also adding another 15 more. Privacy advocates have raised concerns in general about these license plate reader cameras because almost every law enforcement agency in the area can get access to the data. ""What is the information being used for? And why is it OK for people's license plates to be captured indiscriminately by law enforcement when people driving down the road are really not breaking any laws,"" said Karen Gullo with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In Orinda, that hasn't seemed to slow down deployment. The city currently has a total of 19 cameras, and of those, only 7 were installed by the city. The other 12 were installed by neighborhood groups or HOAs. ""I want to keep my neighbors and my neighborhood safe. Absolutely,"" said Scott Johnson. He said his HOA already paid for a camera at the entrance to their community. Johnson said while he thinks the city should pick up the tab, he's willing to foot the bill if necessary. ""Fix the roads and fix the lights. Yes, we'd all like to see society work better, but a lot of our municipalities really don't seem to be following through,"" he said.

Crumbling water main leaves people in a Pleasanton neighborhood high and dry,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/pleasanton-water-shut-off/,Crumbling water main leaves people in a Pleasanton neighborhood high and dry,"Last week a group of homeowners in Pleasanton had their water cut off by the city. They're locked in a battle over who should pay to replace a crumbling water main and, in the meantime, neighbors have found a creative way of helping each other out. In the middle of Pleasanton is a small neighborhood known as the Remen Tract that, years ago, refused to be annexed into the city. Rick Hempy lives there and said that's what's behind the disagreement over the neighborhood's water pipes. ""These lines that are in here were put in in 1950--two-inch steel lines--and they are disintegrating,"" he said. ""And the city of Pleasanton used to come out here and fix them. But now they're saying, 'you're on your own. Because you're in the county, even though you get city services--water, sewer, police, fire--we don't care!'"" In August, a water main started leaking and when the city came out to fix it, they discovered that the whole thing needed to be replaced. They rigged up a temporary supply line using fire hoses connected to a hydrant. But the city says they will not be replacing the permanent line. In a statement, Communications Manager Heather Tiernan said, ""The water system within Remen Tract is privately owned, and just as the City does not maintain individual property owners' water lines, it cannot maintain the private water lines within the Remen Tract."" Needless to say, the homeowners disagreed. ""This is the city of Pleasanton service territory for this municipal utility,"" said homeowner Rob Schurhoff, ""and anything on their side of the meter is their responsibility. It's in the Pleasanton municipal code. So, it's cut and dried as far as I'm concerned."" So, the fire hoses remained in place and that's how things stayed for 9 months...until about five days ago. ""So, yeah, I was really surprised when I was on the phone and, like, eight trucks came out here and removed the temporary hoses in less than five minutes and took off. I think they thought we might have an uprising or something, I don't know!"" said Schurhoff. ""And for them to come out and just unhook the water...I think it's criminal!"" said Hempy. So, how many houses are without water? ""Six,"" he said. ""They're stuck!"" Well, not really. Because the neighbors are helping each other out. Hoses have been extended from one house to another to supply the six who were left high and dry. ""Yeah, we had to rig this up because I couldn't flush my toilet or anything,"" said Schurhoff, with a laugh. And Hempy said the effort to create their own jerry-rigged water system has only brought the neighborhood closer together. ""That hose is coming from a rental way over there,' said Hempy. ""So, it's going through three yards and coming over here to take care of these three houses! Now that's nice neighbors. That's good people."" The neighbors estimate it could cost them about $6,000 each to replace the line. But they say Pleasanton charges them the same water rates as any other municipal customer and they expect the city to repair the broken line. So far, there is no resolution in sight. The neighbors believe city officials are just trying to wash their hands of the problem. Although they may have to go to another block to find the water to do that.

Oakland interim mayor delivers budget proposal as city faces $268M deficit,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/oakland-interim-mayor-delivers-2025-27-budget-proposal-268m-deficit/,Oakland interim mayor delivers budget proposal as city faces $268M deficit,"Interim Oakland Mayor Kevin Jenkins delivered a nearly $4.4 billion, two-year budget proposal to the City Council Monday, emphasizing the need to protect police and fire services while simultaneously tackling a massive budget deficit. Along with the draft budget documents, Jenkins delivered a letter to the Council laying out in broad strokes his vision for the city's financial life, including how he'll eliminate an estimated $268 million deficit over the next two fiscal years. ""It's a pathway to physical stability,"" Jenkins said of his proposal. ""We want to ensure that public safety is a priority, that we are doing a really good job at our core statutory services."" Jenkins said he realizes that Oaklanders want to feel safer in their city and are alarmed at the prospect of cuts to police, fire and the Department of Violence Prevention. He said that the city saw a 30 percent reduction in its homicide rate over the past year and his budget will help build on that momentum by, in part, funding six police academies and providing enough money for 678 officers, with a goal of getting to 700 officers in the future. Jenkins' budget also includes two fire academies and, thanks to the recent voter-approved Measure A, funding for four fire stations that might otherwise be on the chopping block. Still, the public safety budgets—which account for 75 percent of the city's general fund spending—weren't spared from cuts. Two fire stations will be ""browned out,"" or temporarily closed, on a rotating basis and the Oakland Police Department's overtime budget has been reduced from a recent high of about $50 million per year to roughly $34 million next fiscal year and $38 million the year after that. ""As the fire department, we understand we're a spoke in the wheel. We're part of the public safety team,"" said Fire Chief Damon Covington. ""Everybody's had to take some level of cut. I know that the interim mayor and the incoming mayor have prioritized public safety, so from the fire departments perspective, we're trying to figure out different ways that we can be less impactful on the budget."" Incoming mayor Barbara Lee has been in near-daily contact with Jenkins and his budget team in order to help guide spending priorities since she won a special April 15 election to replace Sheng Thao, who voters ousted in a recall election last November. Sometime in mid- to late-May, Lee will take over for Jenkins who, as City Council president, has been filling in since Thao left office in December. Lee didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. In addition to public safety budget cuts, Jenkins' budget eliminates more than 400 mostly vacant city jobs and anticipates fewer than a dozen actual layoffs. It also anticipates adding additional revenue streams to the city budget, including a proposed $40 million-a-year parcel tax for the June 2026 ballot. It also envisions bond sales of $180 million for affordable housing investments and $15 million each year for the next two years for street paving. While the budget Jenkins delivered is balanced, his letter to the City Council warns that employee pension and medical benefit expenses are expected to rise faster than the city's project revenue growth for the foreseeable future, which means that city leaders will likely be making difficult budget decisions for years to come. In addition to police and fire budgets, Jenkins said he prioritized spending on combating illegal dumping, cleaning up homeless encampments and removing abandoned vehicles from city streets, among other things. While he didn't give specific numbers, he also said that funding levels for Oakland Parks and Recreation Department's summer and after school programs remain intact, as does spending on public libraries. Jenkins' budget proposal now is in the hands of the City Council, which has until June 30 to make whatever changes it has in mind and pass a final budget. Councilman Noel Gallo, who is serving as interim City Council president, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","Updated on: May 6, 2025 / 7:47 AM PDT / CBS/Bay City News Service",N/A

According to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office, Jeanette Ralston was last seen leaving the Lion's Den bar in San Jose bar with a man just before midnight on January 31, 1977. Her body was found the next day in a car in the parking lot of a nearby apartment complex. Ralston was 24-years-old and living in San Mateo at the time. At the time the medical examiner determined she was strangled by a long-sleeve shirt that was tied around her neck. The autopsy revealed evidence of sexual assault. The D.A.'s office said the suspect tried to light the car on fire but the Volkswagen didn't burn. Cold case detectives got a break in the case in 2024 when they found the fingerprint on a pack of Eve cigarettes. They were able to use the fingerprint to identify 69-year-old Willie Eugene Sims. The D.A.'s office said Sims was an Army Private at Ford Ord at the time. One year after the attack on Ralston he was convicted for an assault to commit murder in Monterey County. Once Sims was identified, San Jose Police investigators traveled to Ohio where they collected a DNA sample from Sims. Investigators said the DNA was consistent with DNA on Ralston's fingernails and the shirt that was found around her neck. District Attorney Jeff Rosen said: ""Every day, forensic science grows better, and every day criminals are closer to being caught. Cases may grow old and be forgotten by the public. We don't forget and we don't give up."" Sims is awaiting extradition to California. He was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Ohio. According to officials with the district attorney's office, Sims could face 25-years to life in prison if he is convicted.","May 6, 2025 / 3:20 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco",N/A
