"Tinx tackles cancel culture, romance in debut novel ""Hotter in the Hamptons"" Christina Najjar, known as Tinx, says she wanted the heroine in her debut novel ""Hotter in the Hamptons"" to be messy ""so that readers could see themselves in her."" 16H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tinx-hotter-in-the-hamptons-debut-novel-cancel-culture/,"Tinx tackles cancel culture and romance in debut novel ""Hotter in the Hamptons""","Social media star and bestselling author Christina Najjar, known as Tinx, is taking on cancel culture, reinvention and unexpected romance in her new book, ""Hotter in the Hamptons,"" which was released on Tuesday. Najjar's debut novel follows Lola Fine, a New York City content creator who retreats to the Hamptons after being canceled, only to discover her summer neighbor is a culture critic who wrote a scathing exposé about her. The two unexpectedly begin a summer fling as Lola embarks on a journey of self-discovery. ""I really wanted my heroine to be complicated and layered, because we're all complicated and layered,"" Najjar told ""CBS Mornings."" ""I wanted her to be messy so that readers could see themselves in her, because we're really all imperfect. We're all works in progress."" The Hamptons setting was chosen for its luxury and dramatic potential, Najjar said. ""My followers know my obsession with rich mom places. And it's shrouded in mystery. It's luxurious. A lot of drama goes down there,"" she said. She even incorporated real locations to provide reference points for readers. The book includes aspects of queer romance, which has drawn some criticism given Najjar's identity as a straight woman. Najjar said that she worked with a queer collaborator to ensure authentic representation. ""I think it's important to have a queer voice in the room, and that's why I wanted to work with a queer collaborator,"" she said. ""So we got that lived experience in the book and I think we nailed it, and it was an incredible experience working with her. I can't wait for people to just read it and form their own opinions.""

"Kamala Harris makes Met Gala debut, says art and politics are related Kamala Harris made an appearance at the 2025 Met Gala on Monday, days after her anticipated return to the public stage where she delivered her first major speech since losing the 2024 presidential election. MAY 5",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-met-gala-2025/,"Kamala Harris makes Met Gala debut, says art and politics are related","Former Vice President Kamala Harris made an appearance at the 2025 Met Gala on Monday, days after her anticipated return to the public stage, where she delivered her first major speech since losing the 2024 presidential election. It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics. ""Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,"" Harris told Vogue. ""Artistic expression — whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion — has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go."" To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,"" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said. While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States. Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own. Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028. ""Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'"" she said. Sources familiar with Harris' thinking told CBS News she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office.

MAY 5",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rihanna-pregnant-2025-met-gala-asap-rocky/,A$AP Rocky confirms baby No. 3 with Rihanna at the 2025 Met Gala,"Rihanna and A$AP Rocky once again stole the show at the Met Gala with tons of news-making moments. The power couple is expecting their third child, the rapper A$AP Rocky confirmed. ""It feels amazing, you know,"" A$AP Rocky, gala co-chair, told reporters who congratulated him Monday after outlets reported the couple was expecting their third child. ""It's time that we show the people what we was cooking up. And I'm glad everybody's happy for us 'cause we definitely happy, you know."" TMZ reported earlier Monday that Rihanna and the rapper were expecting their third child. A representative for Rihanna didn't immediately return The Associated Press' request for comment. Photos taken of the singer on Monday walking in New York showed her with what appeared to be a baby bump. ""Honestly, it's a blessing nonetheless,"" Rocky told The AP. ""Because you know how like some people in other situations at times can be envious of other people. But we've been seeing love for the most part. And we real receptive to that and appreciate that, you know what I mean? That's love. Love is love."" This year, A$AP Rocky walked the blue carpet alone before Rihanna's arrival. She was among the last people to walk the carpet on Monday. The clothing and makeup entrepreneur and singer didn't attend the 2024 Met Gala, but in 2023, she and her longtime partner were also among the last to arrive. The couple announced their last pregnancy in a similarly starry way: At the 2023 Super Bowl, Rihanna emerged on stage for her halftime performance with a baby bump on full display. Their son Riot Rose was born later that year. The couple debuted the newest addition to their family in a rare photoshoot in September of that year. It also featured their first child, RZA, who was born in May 2022. Rocky is one of the 2025 Met Gala co-chairs of the menswear-theme event tied to the museum's ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style."" But his attendance at this year's Met Gala wasn't always a sure bet. That announcement came a couple of months before the opening of his trial on firearms charges in Los Angeles. Rocky was ultimately found not guilty in mid-February. Jurors had deliberated for just about three hours before reaching the verdict. At his trial, he showed his eye for fashion. He sported tailored suits and luxury labels throughout the proceedings. Yves Saint Laurent even put out press releases directing attention to his high-fashion court attire. He was clad in a pinstripe Saint Laurent suit for the verdict. Upon the reading of the verdict, Rocky ran toward the back of the room to hug Rihanna, who appeared inside the court on multiple occasions throughout the trial. Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, had faced up to 24 years in prison if he had been convicted of all charges. He's collaborated with several designers and brands on shoes, sunglasses and clothing collections. In December, he was honored with the Cultural Innovator Award at the British Fashion Council's Fashion Awards.","Updated on: May 5, 2025 / 10:23 PM EDT / CBS/AP",N/A

It was designed by Ross and Nigerian fashion designer Ugo Mozie, according to Vogue. The 18-foot long train is not only embroidered with bead detailing but also includes the names of Ross's children — Rhonda, Tracee, Chudney, Ross, and Evan, and her eight grandchildren: Raif, Callaway, Everlee, Leif, Indigo, Jagger, Bronx, and Ziggy, the fashion magazine said.

Here's how much it costs to attend the 2025 Met Gala Ticket prices to the 2025 Met Gala run more than the average down payment on a house — if you can snag an invite. MAY 5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2025-met-gala-ticket-cost/,How much does it cost to attend the 2025 Met Gala?,"Inflation has pushed up the price of many things, but not of tickets to the 2025 Met Gala. The A-list event, held annually on the first Monday in May to benefit The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, draws celebrities from the worlds of entertainment, business and other domains in support of the Met's acquisitions and exhibitions on fashion. While the cost of attending the event, dubbed ""fashion's biggest night,"" jumped in 2024, the price of tickets to this year's gala is unchanged. The catch? You must be invited to attend — tickets aren't available for purchase by the general public. The cost of entry to the 2025 Met Gala for an individual is $75,000. Tables for multiple guests start at $350,000. Often, couture powerhouses that sell high-end fashion will purchase tables and invite stars as their guests, so some celebrities won't pay a dime to attend. The Met Gala's theme changes every year to celebrate the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition. The year's theme: ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style."" It is the first Met exhibit devoted exclusively to Black designers and the first in more than two decades to focus on menswear, according to The Associated Press. ""I think honoring minorities, honoring Black and brown people in these spaces and outside every day, is important,"" musical artist Janelle Monáe, told the wire service. ""The ones who have dedicated their lives to this country to serve, build and give us art to sustain us for a lifetime. We should continue to honor them and push forward and stand on their shoulders."" Monáe is a member this year's Gala host committee, along with Simone Biles, Spike Lee, Ayo Edebiri, André 3000, and other public figures across sports and the arts. The museum in February revealed the event's co-chairs and host committee as well as its dress code, ""Tailored for You."" It relates to the exhibition, focusing on tailored suiting styles and menswear, but leaves room for interpretation. The 2025 Met Gala co-chairs are actor Colman Domingo, Formula I driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, hip hop impresario Pharrell Williams, and fashion icon Anna Wintour, the long-time editor-in-chief of Vogue. NBA star LeBron James is serving as an honorary chair, according to The Met. The annual benefit provides the costume department with its primary source of annual funding for exhibitions, publications, acquisitions and other operating costs. This year's event has already raised a record $31 million, according to the Met. One day before the Met Gala, a newer red-carpet event, The Debt Gala, will be held in Brooklyn. The event was founded to raise funds for organizations that help relieve medical debt for people in marginalized communities. It also has a theme: Let Them Eat Cake: Ruined Riches. Tickets cost $35.

"What to know as Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex trafficking trial starts Jury selection has started in music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex-trafficking trial. Here's what to know. 20H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sean-diddy-combs-trial-sex-trafficking-charges-evidence/,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex trafficking trial is underway. Here's what to know about the charges, evidence and more.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial in New York City this month. Jury selection began Monday, and opening statements are scheduled to follow on May 12. Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal. As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know. One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment. Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts — one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution — against him in early April. The indictment alleges Combs ""engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,"" which was ""verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual."" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him. The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called ""Freak Offs,"" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, ""in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,"" and sometimes lasted multiple days. Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by ""striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,"" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment. In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct. According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3. Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors. If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him. His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from ""former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships."" ""This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,"" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment. A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial. The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN obtained and published the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs. Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage. Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a ""Freak Off."" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a ""glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship"" between the two. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said. Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial. Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions. They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers. It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial. Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors. In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not ""explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury"" nor acknowledge ""the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs."" They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners. Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were ""utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury."" Elias E.

It wasn't immediately clear how the tariffs would be applied. Mr. Trump said the incentives that other countries are offering filmmakers and studios constitute a national security threat. ""Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.

Brazilian police arrest 2 in thwarted bomb plot at Lady Gaga Rio concert Organizers of a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro said the event drew more than 2 million to Copacabana Beach. MAY 5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lady-gaga-free-concert-copacabana-beach-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-two-million-fans/,Brazilian police arrest 2 in thwarted bomb plot at Lady Gaga Rio concert with 2 million fans,"Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro. Saturday's event drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach. Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. ""The plan was treated as a 'collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,"" the police said. Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack — the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio. The concert was the biggest show of Gaga's career. ""Tonight, we're making history,"" Lady Gage told a screaming crowd. ""Thank you for making history with me."" A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told CBS News the team learned of the alleged threats through media reports. ""Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,"" the spokesperson said. ""Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place."" The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show just after 10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song ""Bloody Mary."" Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder to shoulder on the vast stretch of sand. Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show, which was funded by the city of Rio in an effort to revitalize the economy. In a recent report, Rio's City Hall said the show should bring in at least 600 million reais, or roughly $106 million. For Gaga, the performance was also an opportunity to promote her upcoming ""Mayhem Ball"" tour, featuring songs from her latest record MAYHEM. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 when it was released in early March and includes new hits like ""Abracadabra."" Lady Gaga also performed a number of older classics at her free show Saturday, including ""Poker Face"" and ""Alejandro,"" switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag. Some fans — many of them young — arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view. ""Today is the best day of my life,"" said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. ""It's surreal to be here."" Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year. The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Year's Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John's Day celebrations in June. ""It brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season — filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,"" said Osmar Lima, the city's secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall's tourism department last month. Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028. Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song ""LoveGame"" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out. While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors. More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio's City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, traveled from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show. ""I've been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,"" said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga's outlandish costumes over the years. For her, the mega-star represents ""total freedom of expression — being who one wants without shame."" Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna's show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history. To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach. Rio state's security plan included 3,300 members of the military, 1,500 police officers and 400 firefighters. Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues. Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait. ""She's the best artist in the world,"" the 25-year-old said, as chants of ""Gaga, I love you"" in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him.","Updated on: May 5, 2025 / 9:30 AM EDT / CBS/AP",N/A
"How Matisse became a name in pottery When Alex Matisse founded East Fork Pottery, in Asheville, N.C., he didn't want to use the name of his great-grandfather, artist Henri Matisse. But after business took off, Alex decided it was time – and now graces his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear. MAY 4",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-matisse-became-a-name-in-pottery/,How Matisse became a name in pottery,"As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself. ""When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,"" he said. ""We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon."" Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, ""I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me."" When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA – because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse. I asked, ""What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?"" ""He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,"" Alex replied. It was a famous last name he ran away from for years. ""I had a very grumpy relationship with it,"" he laughed. ""It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake."" Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm. I asked, ""Did she have the same passion for it that you did?"" ""No. She didn't have a passion for clay,"" Alex said. ""But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?"" ""Yeah. She stuck around,"" he laughed. And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, ""If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did."" So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors. He was excited. ""And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,"" he said. ""And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds."" And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off. Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves ""Potheads."" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars. And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect. ""We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,"" Alex said. ""But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally."" Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again. He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. ""Oh, geez. No."" Alex said, ""Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about."" Henri Matisse once famously said, ""Creativity takes courage."" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing. ""There's not a heaviness to it,"" he said. ""It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it."" For more info: Story produced by Kay Lim. Editor: Remington Korper.

Mary Todd Lincoln: ""How would it look? Sensational!!"" It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together. Abraham Lincoln: ""No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!"" Mary Todd Lincoln: ""With who?"" Abraham Lincoln: ""The south!"" Mary Todd Lincoln: ""Of what?"" It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (""Well, speak for yourself, Mo!""), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records. What does that say? ""Inflation is high,"" Escola laughed. Escola came up with the idea in 2009: ""I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?"" But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. ""I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me – to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,"" Escola said. ""There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'"" Escola eventually wrote the play. ""Oh, Mary!"" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor). It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. ""When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back."" The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. ""Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta."" I asked, ""And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?"" ""No, no,"" Escola replied. ""Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'"" ""And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?"" ""Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do."" Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, ""I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it."" Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt. I asked, ""Comedically, have you always done your own thing?"" ""Yes."" ""So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?"" ""No,"" said Escola. ""It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh."" Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (""It was New York or bust!""), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. ""I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.' ""I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you."" Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as ""Mom Commercial"" (2015): … and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like ""At Home with Amy Sedaris."" And then along came Mary. I said, ""You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'"" ""No,"" Escola said. ""There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.""

"Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's ""act of war"" 2H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-pakistan-kashmir-strikes-sharif-revenge-modi/,"Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's strikes, calling them an ""act of war""","Islamabad — India fired missiles into Pakistani-controlled territory in several locations early Wednesday, killing at least 26 people including a child, in what Pakistan's leader called an act of war. India said it struck infrastructure used by militants linked to last month's massacre of tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. Pakistan said it had shot down several Indian fighter jets in retaliation as three planes fell onto villages in India-controlled Kashmir. At least seven civilians were also killed in the region by Pakistani shelling, Indian police and medics said. Tension has soared between the nuclear-armed neighbors since an attack in which gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, at a popular meadow in the disputed territory of Kashmir, in some cases killing men before their wives' eyes. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the attack, something Islamabad has denied. Kashmir, which is divided between the two countries but claimed in its entirety by each, has been at the center of tensions for decades and they have fought two wars over it. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Wednesday's airstrikes and said his country would retaliate. ""Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given,"" Sharif said. The country's National Security Committee met Wednesday morning, and Pakistan summoned India's charge d'affaires to lodge a protest. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a special meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security. A source told the Reuters news agency Modi postponed a trip to Croatia, the Netherlands and Norway. South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said it was one the highest-intensity strikes from India on its rival in years and that Pakistan's response would ""surely pack a punch as well."" ""These are two strong militaries that, even with nuclear weapons as a deterrent, are not afraid to deploy sizeable levels of conventional military force against each other,"" Kugelman said. ""The escalation risks are real. And they could well increase, and quickly."" Stephane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesperson, said in a statement late Tuesday that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint because the world could not ""afford a military confrontation"" between India and Pakistan. Several Indian states planned civil defense drills later Wednesday, according to India's home ministry, to train civilians and security personnel to respond in case of any ""hostile attacks,"" the ministry said in a statement. Such drills in India are rare in non-crisis times. Indian politicians from different political parties lauded the strikes. ""Victory to Mother India,"" India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X. India's main opposition Congress party called for national unity and said it was ""extremely proud"" of the country's army. ""We applaud their resolute resolve and courage,"" Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge said. India's army said the operation was named ""Sindoor,"" a Hindi word for the bright red vermillion powder worn by married Hindu women on their forehead and hair, referring to the women whose husbands were killed in front of them. India's missiles hit six locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country's eastern Punjab province, killing at least 26 people including women and children, said Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif. Officials said another 38 people were injured by the strikes, and another five people were killed in Pakistan during exchanges of fire across the border later in the day. Sharif said the Indian jets also damaged infrastructure at a dam in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, calling it a violation of international norms. India's Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted at least nine sites ""where terrorist attacks against India have been planned."" ""Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistan military facilities have been targeted,"" the statement said, adding that ""India has demonstrated considerable restraint."" Pakistan said the strikes hit at least two sites previously tied to banned militant groups. One hit the Subhan Mosque in Punjab's Bahawalpur city, killing 13 people including a child, according to Zohaib Ahmed, a doctor at a nearby hospital. The mosque is near a seminary that was once the central office of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group outlawed in 2002. Officials say the group has had no operational presence at the site since the ban. In a statement obtained by CBS News, Jaish-e-Mohammed's chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, claimed India's attack killed 10 of his family members and four close associates. He criticized Modi, saying, ""This cruelty has broken all limits—do not expect mercy anymore."" Another missile hit a mosque in Muridke, damaging its structure. A sprawling building located nearby served as the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba until 2013, when Pakistan banned the group and arrested its founder. Last month's attack on tourists was claimed by a group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance, which India says is also known as The Resistance Front and is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. In Muzaffarabad, the main city of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, resident Abdul Sammad said he heard several explosions as the blast ripped through houses. He saw people running in panic and authorities immediately cut power to the area. People took refuge on the streets and in open areas, fearful of what might happen. ""We were afraid the next missile might hit our house,"" said Mohammad Ashraf. Chaudhry Ghulam Rasool, who lives near the mosque, told CBS News, ""We were just about to go to bed when a huge blast happened. It was very big and terrifying explosions."" Along the Line of Control, which divides the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan, there were heavy exchanges of fire. The Indian police and medics said seven civilians were killed and 30 wounded by Pakistani shelling in Poonch district near the highly militarized Line of Control, the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir between the two countries. Officials said several homes also were damaged in the shelling. The Indian army said Pakistani troops ""resorted to arbitrary firing,"" including gunfire and artillery shelling, across the frontier. Shortly after India's strikes, aircraft fell onto three villages in India-controlled Kashmir. Sharif, the Pakistani military spokesperson, said the country's air force shot down five Indian jets in retaliation for the strikes. There was no immediate comment from India about Pakistan's claim. Debris from a plane was scattered across Wuyan village in the outskirts of the region's main city, including in a school and a mosque compound, according to Srinagar police and residents. Firefighters struggled for hours to douse the resulting fires. ""There was a huge fire in the sky. Then we heard several blasts also,"" said Mohammed Yousuf Dar, a Wuyan resident. Another aircraft fell in an open field in Bhardha Kalan village, near the Line of Control in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Village resident Sachin Kumar told The Associated Press he heard massive blasts followed by a huge ball of fire. Kumar said he and and several other villagers rushed to the scene and found two pilots with injuries. Both were later taken away by the Indian army. A third aircraft crashed in a farm field in India's northern Punjab state, a police office told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The officer did not provide further details. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, President Trump called the strikes ""a shame."" ""We just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They've been fighting for a long time. You know, they've been fighting for many many decades, and centuries actually, if you really think about it. No, I just hope it ends very quickly."" China called for restraint from both sides following India's strikes. ""China expresses regret over India's military actions this morning and is concerned about the current developments. China opposes all forms of terrorism,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in a statement. ""We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritize peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation."" Beijing is the largest investor in Pakistan by far, with a $65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project that spans across the country. China meanwhile also has multiple border claims disputed with India, with one of those claims in the northeastern part of the Kashmir region. French news agency AFP reports that British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio Wednesday the UK is ""a friend, a partner to both countries. We stand ready to support both countries. Both have a huge interest in regional stability, in dialogue, in de-escalation and anything we can do to support that, we are here and willing to do."" Moscow on Wednesday called for both India and Pakistan to show ""restraint,"" AFP says.","May 7, 2025 / 3:52 AM EDT / CBS/AP",N/A
When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? 1H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conclave-2025-when-will-cardinals-replace-pope-francis/,When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? Here's how long it's taken to see white smoke in the past,"It's nearing decision time for the most senior members of the Catholic Church. The 133 cardinal electors due to choose a successor to the late Pope Francis gathered for a final Mass on Wednesday morning, just hours before they were to launch the secretive, centuries-old ritual known as the conclave to pick a new pontiff. Later Wednesday, the electors will be locked inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, where they will hold as many rounds of voting as prove necessary to select the next leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take. The conclave begins on Wednesday — 16 days after Pope Francis' death. It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years. In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials. The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices. The 133 electors participating this time around can hold one round of voting in the afternoon of the first day of the conclave, which consists of two ballots. To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day. From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options. There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved. The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The longest conclave on record took nearly three years. The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long — about 1,000 days — that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision. That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope — ""conclave,"" which translates to ""under lock and key"" — came from. After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271. There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history. The last three popes have been elected in two or three days. In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots. Vatican watcher John Allen, the editor of the Catholic news outlet Crux, believes this conclave may well follow that pattern, and we could expect a new pope to be named by the end of the week. After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected, black smoke rises from the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises. Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting. White smoke was first used in 1914, when Cardinals decided the light colored smoke should announce the selection of a new pope, Georgtown University reported. Now, to ensure the result of each ballot is clear, chemicals are burned alongside the ballots in each round to color the smoke black or white. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Truman has been lost in the Red Sea, a defense official confirmed to CBS News. The two pilots aboard the aircraft sustained minor injuries in the ordeal. The official said in a statement that the Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman Tuesday ""when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard."" An arrestment is the mechanism that a carrier uses to safely slow down and halt a fighter jet as it lands. ""Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 11,"" the official said. ""The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries. No flight deck personnel were injured."" On April 28, a Super Hornet was being towed in the Truman hangar bay when crews lost control of the aircraft and it went overboard, along with the tow tractor. One sailor suffered minor injuries in the incident. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that initial reports suggested the jet may have fallen overboard after the carrier turned sharply while taking evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants. Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said in statement that the Super Hornet that went into the Red Sea Tuesday ""was not struck by the Houthis."" The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since it deployed to the Middle East in September 2024. In December, the USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 which had taken off from the Truman. The two-person crew were able to safely eject. In February, the Truman accidentally collided with a merchant vessel near the Suez Canal. Also Tuesday, President Trump disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to a deal that would see them halt their attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. Those attacks started in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel.

Trump wants the Fed to cut rates today. Will it oblige? 16H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-rate-cut-jerome-powell-may-7-fomc-meeting/,Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will Jerome Powell oblige?,"President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been ""TOO LATE AND WRONG"" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision — but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction. The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty — costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out. ""The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,"" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email. He added, ""The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer."" Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7. The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day. Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. ""Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response — neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,"" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note. Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists. Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting. However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes. But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer. ""We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,"" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December. Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked. On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is ""NO INFLATION"" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon. But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined — gas costs are down 10% from a year ago — continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say. ""There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,"" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. ""No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates."" Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates. ""Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,"" he noted. ""When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards."" Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.

What U.S. Catholics are looking for in the next pope — CBS News poll 12H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-us-catholics-look-to-next-pope/,New pope could be elected in days. Here's what U.S. Catholics are looking for — CBS News poll,"In the eyes of U.S. Catholics, the next pope is going to have big — if not red — shoes to fill. Most say the Church is in touch with the needs of Catholics, a view that's higher today than when Pope Francis (who famously wore simple black shoes) became pontiff in 2013. Just before Francis' papacy, which today gets 76% approval, most U.S. Catholics said the Church was out of touch. As such, many U.S. Catholics would see the next pope continue Francis' teachings, and others would move toward still more progressive ones. Those who'd continue Francis' teachings tend to be younger. And by two to one, more U.S. Catholics overall say Francis' papacy left them feeling more connected to the Church than less. While most say it doesn't matter where the next pope comes from, plenty of U.S. Catholics — if given a choice — would like the next Pope to come from the U.S., their top choice out of other countries or regions. Hispanic Americans — who make up a third of US Catholics — also favor the U.S., but South America, Mexico and Central America are also noted. Most also want the next pope to be outspoken on world political issues. What kinds of changes are Catholics looking for? Most U.S. Catholics would look for a pope who is in favor of letting priests marry; of letting women be ordained as priests; and — overwhelmingly — for the use of birth control. But here again there are differences between the (smaller group of) regular churchgoers, and the larger group of U.S. Catholics who rarely or never go. These majority views are driven much more by the latter group, who also say the Church is out of touch with Catholics' needs — which may be one reason they'd seek a new pope in favor of changes such as these. Most U.S. Catholics want the next pope to continue to prioritize tradition in general, even as some specific things draw calls for change. And they have at least some confidence (if not a great deal) the conclave will choose a pope in touch with the needs of Catholics — this view is especially the case among the most frequent attendees. Those who think the Church is currently out of touch have comparably less confidence that the conclave will pick a pope who is. But the next pope will oversee a U.S. Catholic laity with some pronounced differences in views between a smaller group who say they attend Mass at least a few times per month — most of whom do think the Church is in touch — and a majority who say they attend only a few times a year or never, and think the Church is out of touch. And U.S. Catholics say they'll be paying attention. Most plan to follow news about the process and selection of a pope at least somewhat closely. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,298 adult Catholics living in the U.S. interviewed between April 30-May 5, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and Mass attendance according to the 2023-24 Pew Religious Landscape Study. The margin of error is ±3.8 points.

Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's industry ties 10H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-genius-act-stablecoin-crypto-bill-trump/,Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's ties to the industry,"Washington — Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday ""we need to start moving forward."" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. ""Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,"" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, ""Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption."" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. ""Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately."" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's ""serious risks"" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."" ""Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,"" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the ""single largest-ever investment in a crypto company"" and sets a ""historic precedent."" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

"HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program 11H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-revokes-some-layoff-notices-including-to-911-program/,"HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program","The Department of Health and Human Services formally revoked some layoff notices on Tuesday, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, restoring some staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Tuesday's letters to laid-off workers notifying them that their employment was being restored went a step further from some previous reinstatements touted by department officials, which often amounted only to a request for civil servants to continue working for a few more weeks to wind down or prepare to hand off their assignments. ""You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) upcoming reduction in force (RIF). That notice is hereby revoked,"" read the letter received by some workers at the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides health care services to 9/11 first responders and survivors. A move last week to cut 15 employees of the 9/11 program, as part of a larger wave of eliminations that gutted most of the work from the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, prompted outcry from New York lawmakers. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. denied cutting the World Trade Center Health Program or NIOSH, which he said are slated to be merged into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America. ""Those programs were not terminated, as the media has reported. But they've simply been consolidated into a place that makes more sense,"" Kennedy said. Some of the FDA's laboratories also received notices Tuesday that they would be formally brought back to work as of Wednesday. Employees of the FDA's food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco all received notices that their layoffs were being reversed, though cuts to probationary workers in the labs have so far not been walked back. Letters to those scientists told them that their previous layoff notices were ""officially RESCINDED"" and that they would be expected to return to work on Wednesday. Not all of the workers that Kennedy or his department have promised to bring back to work have received notices restoring their jobs. Two other labs at the FDA — drug safety scientists in Puerto Rico and Detroit — have so far not received letters, multiple laid-off employees in the labs said. Employees of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health also remain off the job. Kennedy had said a month ago that he would restore the lead poisoning experts in the center, saying that some of the layoffs could have been mistakes. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details on which teams were cut and which were being brought back. Tuesday's move to reverse some layoffs at HHS comes days after the department laid off hundreds more employees at the National Institutes of Health, blindsiding staff who had survived the initial wave of cuts in April. Layoffs included staff at the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Library of Medicine and Office of Research Facilities, two people said. NIH employees were told that the additional cuts were prompted by a need to reinstate scientists while also meeting strict layoff quotas sought by the department.

Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza 9H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-less-than-2-dozen-hostages-believed-to-be-alive-in-gaza/,Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,"President Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. ""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. ""There's 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,"" Mr. Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition.","Updated on: May 6, 2025 / 8:42 PM EDT / AP",N/A
"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-may-soon-deport-migrants-to-libya/,"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say","The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans. Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

5 charged after migrant boat capsized off San Diego coast,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-migrant-boat-human-smuggling/,5 charged after migrant boat capsizes off San Diego; Noem asks DOJ for death penalty,"Five Mexican nationals are facing charges after a small boat carrying more than a dozen people capsized off the coast of San Diego, killing three passengers, including a 14-year-old boy from India, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of California announced Tuesday. The boy's parents and two others were hospitalized following the human smuggling event, prosecutors confirmed in a news release. Nine other migrants were missing from the boat and were presumed dead, but authorities later located eight of them in Chula Vista, nearly 30 miles away from Del Mar, where the boat was found. A 10-year-old Indian girl, the boy's sister, remains missing, prosecutors said. ""The drowning deaths of these children are a heartbreaking reminder of how little human traffickers care about the costs of their deadly business,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said in a statement. U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday that there were originally 16 individuals on board, some of whom remain missing. Jesus Ivan Rodriguez-Leyva and Julio Cesar Zuniga-Luna were arrested on Monday at the beach where the overturned boat washed ashore, according to prosecutors. They were charged with Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Bringing in Aliens for Financial Gain, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday night announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty. ""Their deaths were not only avoidable but were also the direct result of the greed and indifference of smugglers who exploited them,"" Noem said in a statement, in part. ""Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, alien smuggling acts that result in death are capital crimes punishable by death. And under the Federal Death Penalty Act, those who intentionally participate in conduct knowing that it could result in the loss of life may be eligible for capital punishment."" Prosecutors said three other suspects — Melissa Jennelle Cota, Gustavo Lara and Sergio Rojas-Fregoso — were arrested late Monday night after Border Patrol agents in Chula Vista identified a vehicle seen at a beach in Del Mar and investigated. While the driver of said vehicle fled, officers located two other vehicles involved and found the missing migrants, according to prosecutors. Cota, Lara and Rojas-Fregoso were charged with Transportation of Illegal Aliens. Prosecutors said Rojas-Fregoso had been previously deported on Dec. 19, 2023. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. It was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles north of the Mexico border, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told The Associated Press. He said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. In 2023, eight people were killed when two boats capsized off the San Diego coast.

Young boy gains perspective well beyond his years after tornado,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-boy-lost-home-oklahoma-tornado-gained-perspective/,"A young boy lost his home in a tornado. One year later, he's gained perspective well beyond his years.","Bartlesville, Oklahoma — A year after a tornado flattened his family's home, 9-year-old River Garrett isn't focused on what was lost — but on what can still be built. ""Rebuilding, it takes a while, it takes hard work. But to me, it's putting something back together where it is better than before,"" River said, outside his grandmother's brand new home in northern Oklahoma. On May 6, 2024, a powerful tornado tore across the area, killing two people and causing $25 million in damage. River's family survived, but their ranch was leveled. Tornado activity like what River lived through has significantly increased. In the first four months of 2025, there were 670 tornado reports and 35 deaths in the U.S. — more than a 43% jump in storms compared to the decade before, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. River's family is still sorting through the bits and pieces they were able to recover, but they consider themselves lucky. In Barnsdall, the next town over, Mayor Johnny Kelley said only 5% of his community has been rebuilt since the last time CBS News visited. But River, though just 8 at the time, seemed to understand the reality that others had it worse off than him. ""And I said to myself that I can't make this about me,"" River told CBS News back then. One year later, River has a new room and some old things that survived the tornado. He hopes to cover the walls with Michael Jackson pictures and records. ""I love my room, too. I was blown away when I saw my room, and I love it,"" River said. When asked how he's changed since the tornado, River said, ""I think I'm more aware of little things that can turn into big things. But I don't always worry about that."" ""I don't sweat unless it gets bigger over time, like the tornado did,"" he added. It's a reminder that even after unimaginable loss, a little perspective can help you heal.

Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-gavin-newsom-film-tariffs-tax-credit/,"Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit to ""Make America Film Again""","President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit. ""California built the film industry — and we're ready to bring even more jobs home. We've proven what strong state incentives can do,"" Newsom's post on X said. ""Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again."" His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was ""DYING a very fast death."" The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels. Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit from $330 million to $750 million. Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027. Mr. Trump said the American film industry has been ""decimated"" by other countries and the ""grossly incompetent"" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to ""abandon"" the U.S. But he vowed that ""we'll get it back."" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to ""make sure they're happy with"" the prospective tariffs. The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?"" Mr. Trump said. ""That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built."" Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage. ""And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,"" he said. He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California. ""I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,"" The president visited Los Angeles in late-January, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. ""I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. ""I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation."" Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor. ""I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,"" he said.

Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-u-s-bicycle-company-kent-international-halts-imports-from-china/,Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,"The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations. ""When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,"" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. ""And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees."" Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream. About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs. During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone. Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold. He says that makes him feel ""really bad"" and ""angry."" ""China is not paying these tariffs,"" Arnold said. ""We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted."" The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May. Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile. ""We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,"" Kramer said. ""And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair."" Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective. ""I can't even calculate that high,"" Kramer said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. ""I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example…I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.""
