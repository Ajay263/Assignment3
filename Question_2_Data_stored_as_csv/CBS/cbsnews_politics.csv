"Seeking spending cuts, GOP targets a tax hospitals love to pay Republicans, on the hunt for spending cuts, are eying a special kind of Medicaid tax that nearly every state uses to boost funding for hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers. 35M AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-spending-cuts-medicaid-tax-hospitals/,"Seeking spending cuts, GOP lawmakers target a tax hospitals love to pay","On the eastern plains of Colorado, in a county of less than 6,000 people, Lincoln Health runs the only hospital within a 75-minute drive. The facility struggles financially, given its small size and the area's tiny population. But for over a decade, the Hugo, Colorado-based health system has remained afloat partially thanks to a surprising source: special taxes on the state's hospitals. The taxes Lincoln pays help cover the state's Medicaid costs and — because the federal government matches a portion of what states spend on Medicaid — enable Colorado to claim more federal money. That generally leads to more dollars for the hospital. The tax proceeds also have helped Colorado expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to cover 400,000 more low-income adults, significantly reducing the number of people showing up at hospital doors without insurance. Last year, Lincoln paid $500,000 in provider taxes but netted more than $3.6 million extra from Medicaid, accounting for about 15% of its budget, said Lincoln CEO Kevin Stansbury. ""These dollars allow me to care for patients who are enrolled in Medicaid and to break even rather than lose money,"" he said. ""Without them, it would significantly impact our ability to survive."" Every state except Alaska uses at least one provider tax to boost its federal Medicaid dollars. But Republicans who control Congress are looking for potential cuts in the nearly $900 billion Medicaid program to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts — and have sought to portray provider taxes as malicious, sometimes even deriding them as ""money laundering."" Lawmakers say they may curtail or eliminate provider taxes as part of legislation to enact Mr. Trump's domestic agenda. ""It's infuriating,"" Stansbury said. Medicaid and the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program together cover roughly 79 million low-income and disabled people and are jointly financed by states and the federal government. Federal dollars match state payments with no limit. While the split varies based on a state's per capita income, the federal match ranges from 50% to 77% for children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, who make up most of the enrollment. States started using provider taxes in the 1980s to help pay their share and gain additional Medicaid funds from the federal government. Brian Blase, a former Trump health policy adviser who leads the conservative Paragon Health Institute, sees provider taxes as one of the highest forms of waste in Medicaid. States and their hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers aren't held accountable for how the tax money is used, reducing incentives for states to control Medicaid spending, he said. ""This has been a feature of the program for four decades, and it is a feature that is getting worse,"" Blase said. The Congressional Budget Office estimates eliminating provider taxes would save the federal government more than $600 billion over a decade. Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.), who chairs the House committee that oversees Medicaid, has said provider taxes are on the menu for potential cuts. Other changes Republicans are considering to cut federal Medicaid spending include requiring adult enrollees to prove they're working as a condition of eligibility, as well as ending higher payments for adults enrolled as part of the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program. Since 2014, more than 20 million nondisabled adults in 40 states and Washington, D.C., have gained coverage under the expansion. House Republicans have set a Memorial Day deadline to come to an agreement on spending cuts, which would help pay for extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts passed during Mr. Trump's first administration and set to expire at the end of this year. The Government Accountability Office and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a congressional advisory board, have raised concerns about the provider taxes, which effectively saddle federal taxpayers with state expenses. Republican and Democrat presidents have criticized or proposed curtailing the use of Medicaid provider taxes — including Mr. Trump in his first term, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden while serving as vice president. But opposition from hospitals, nursing homes, and states snuffed out any move to limit or end the arrangements. Colorado and other states often use the money to maintain or increase payments to providers, which are often paid less by Medicaid than by Medicare, the federal program primarily for people 65 or older, or private insurers. States have added provider taxes to help generate federal money to cope with economic downturns and budget constraints. Hospitals in Idaho last year began paying an additional provider tax to increase pay to hospitals and home- and community-based providers. The tax came as Idaho's Republican-controlled legislature sought to add many conditions that threatened to end the state's Medicaid expansion — which would also eliminate a key source of increased federal funding. Brian Whitlock, president and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association, said funding from the hospital tax helps boost Medicaid payments to about 80% of Medicare's rates instead of 60%. ""We still lose money on every Medicare and Medicaid patient,"" he said. ""The state recognizes that this money helps offset the losses we take under Medicaid reimbursement."" While hospitals and nursing homes have been the main beneficiaries of provider tax proceeds, ambulance services have also paid and benefited from Medicaid taxes. States increasingly have also approved Medicaid taxes on private insurers that operate their Medicaid programs to gain more federal funds. California's Medicaid managed care tax began in 2009 and is expected to generate nearly $9 billion in net revenue for the 2024-25 fiscal period — or about 5% of the state's Medicaid budget, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office. In recent years, California has extended full Medicaid coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal status. Federal law prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to cover people in the country without authorization, but states can use their own money. At a presentation to congressional staffers in April, Blase cited California's strategy as an example of provider tax abuse and claimed the state is effectively laundering federal funds to cover people living in the country illegally. In practice, the tax has been a kind of fiscal pressure valve generally offsetting state spending. A ballot measure that passed in November now requires that much of the money from California's tax specifically be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Hospital officials and state Medicaid leaders argue the term ""money laundering"" is an inaccurate way to describe provider taxes, since they are allowed by federal law. But Blase said calling the levies a ""tax"" is misleading, pointing out that most businesses don't typically advocate to pay one. Jamie Whitney, chief legal officer for Texas-based Adelanto HealthCare Ventures, a consulting firm, said that provider taxes are a politically neutral way to help states pay for Medicaid and that curtailing their use would harm them all. ""This is not a red-state, blue-state issue,"" she said. Colorado is one of more than a dozen states that have funded an ACA Medicaid expansion using provider tax money. Others include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. Colorado implemented its Medicaid provider tax effort in 2009. In the 2024 fiscal year, about $5 billion of the state's $15 billion Medicaid program was funded by provider taxes, according to the state. The money helps the state pay higher Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals, which reduces their need to charge higher rates to private insurers, said Kim Bimestefer, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which oversees Medicaid. Some of the extra payments are dependent on hospitals meeting certain quality and patient-safety metrics, such as reducing readmission rates after patients are discharged — a requirement state officials say improves care for everyone. The provider taxes also fund a program allowing working residents with disabilities to buy into Medicaid coverage even if their income is as high as 300% of the federal poverty level, or $46,950 for an individual. About 20,000 people are enrolled in the program. Among them is Alison Sbrana, 31, of Fort Collins, Colorado, who has a type of chronic fatigue syndrome and relies on Medicaid to cover long-term home care. ""It would be devastating if the benefit went away,"" said Sbrana, who works as a researcher and activist for those with the same disorder. ""I would be forced to stop working to keep my income low enough to qualify."" The state's provider taxes also pay for a $60 million fund to support rural hospitals, helping them add telehealth services, recruit surgeons, and hire paramedics, according to a state report. Konnie Martin, CEO of San Luis Valley Health, a two-hospital system based in Alamosa, Colorado, said her nonprofit paid $5.4 million in provider taxes last year and gained about $15 million in benefits from higher Medicaid payments and the rural grants. She said the money helps her hospital maintain obstetrical services, so residents don't have to drive 120 miles to the nearest maternity hospital. Without the birthing center, the entire region would suffer, she said. ""It also would gut the economy of the community, because young people will move away,"" she said.

"Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive national film tax credit. 4H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-gavin-newsom-film-tariffs-tax-credit/,"Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit to ""Make America Film Again""","President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit. ""California built the film industry — and we're ready to bring even more jobs home. We've proven what strong state incentives can do,"" Newsom's post on X said. ""Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again."" His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was ""DYING a very fast death."" The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels. Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit from $330 million to $750 million. Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027. Mr. Trump said the American film industry has been ""decimated"" by other countries and the ""grossly incompetent"" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to ""abandon"" the U.S. But he vowed that ""we'll get it back."" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to ""make sure they're happy with"" the prospective tariffs. The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?"" Mr. Trump said. ""That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built."" Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage. ""And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,"" he said. He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California. ""I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,"" The president visited Los Angeles in late-January, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. ""I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. ""I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation."" Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor. ""I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,"" he said.

"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, two U.S. officials told CBS News. 6H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-may-soon-deport-migrants-to-libya/,"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say","The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans. Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

Truman has been lost in the Red Sea, a defense official confirmed to CBS News. The two pilots aboard the aircraft sustained minor injuries in the ordeal. The official said in a statement that the Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman Tuesday ""when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard."" An arrestment is the mechanism that a carrier uses to safely slow down and halt a fighter jet as it lands. ""Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 11,"" the official said. ""The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries. No flight deck personnel were injured."" On April 28, a Super Hornet was being towed in the Truman hangar bay when crews lost control of the aircraft and it went overboard, along with the tow tractor. One sailor suffered minor injuries in the incident. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that initial reports suggested the jet may have fallen overboard after the carrier turned sharply while taking evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants. Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said in statement that the Super Hornet that went into the Red Sea Tuesday ""was not struck by the Houthis."" The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since it deployed to the Middle East in September 2024. In December, the USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 which had taken off from the Truman. The two-person crew were able to safely eject. In February, the Truman accidentally collided with a merchant vessel near the Suez Canal. Also Tuesday, President Trump disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to a deal that would see them halt their attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. Those attacks started in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel.

""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths.

One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel.

Trump touts $9 trillion in new U.S. investment. The numbers don't add up. Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims. 9H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fact-check-trump-9-trillion-us-investments/,Trump touts $9 trillion in new U.S. investment. The numbers don't add up.,"After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States. ""I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. ""If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that."" He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years. Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion. Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term. Here's a breakdown of the claims. The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled ""The Trump Effect"" — which it said demonstrated ""his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment."" That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy. A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office. The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website. The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion. Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment — announced last October — in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina. The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed ""immediately,"" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term. But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term. However, Biden's list of investments highlighted ""a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries"" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's ""Investing in America"" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list. By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries — many without clear timelines or locations. For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by the Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally. However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action. ""Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,"" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. ""It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama."" Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report. During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments. Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place — but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Trump, may take years to assess. ""It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,"" Nigro said.

"Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's industry ties Sen. Elizabeth Warren is urging other Democrats not to support a bipartisan crypto regulation bill, as Democrats warn about President Trump's ties to crypto. 10H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-genius-act-stablecoin-crypto-bill-trump/,Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's ties to the industry,"Washington — Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday ""we need to start moving forward."" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. ""Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,"" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, ""Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption."" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. ""Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately."" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's ""serious risks"" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."" ""Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,"" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the ""single largest-ever investment in a crypto company"" and sets a ""historic precedent."" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

""If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protests happened, I'd probably support him,"" Tillis said. Sen. Dick Durbin, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, said the ""writing's on the wall"" for Martin. President Trump nominated Martin to run the office that prosecuted more than 1,500 Capitol defendants, although Martin previously worked to defend some of those very same people. Martin has been serving as the District's top prosecutor in an acting capacity since Inauguration Day. Martin has said he shares Mr. Trump's view of the Capitol attack as a ""day of love,"" and he has already fired some of the prosecutors who handled Jan. 6 cases. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney expires May 20. Asked by reporters at his weekly news conference later Tuesday whether he would move to discharge Martin from the Senate Judiciary Committee, Thune said, ""we will cross that bridge if and when we come to it, but it's ultimately going to be a decision that the Judiciary Committee makes first.""

Most of the Oval Office meeting focused on tariffs and the relationship between Canada and the U.S., with Carney emphatically telling Mr. Trump that Canada is ""not for sale"" and ""won't be for sale, ever,"" while Mr. Trump called the border between the U.S. and Canada ""artificial"" and again raised the idea of Canada joining the U.S. But part way through the meeting, the president digressed to talk about the Obama Presidential Library, which is being built in Chicago's Jackson Park. In his comments, he derided the project and blamed ""DEI"" and ""woke"" for it being ""a disaster."" ""I mean look, President Obama — and if he wanted help, I'd give him help because I build on time and on budget — he's building his presidential library in Chicago. It's a disaster,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And he said something to the effect, 'I only want DEI, I only want woke.' He wants woke people to build it. Well, he got woke people and they have massive cost overruns, the job is stopped. I don't know, it's a disaster."" According to updates posted on the Obama Foundation website, work has continued to close the exterior of building and install glass and granite finishing, and instal interior windows on the museum levels. The foundation said insulation has also been installed in several other buildings at the complex. However, Mr. Trump claimed the center is ""millions of dollars, like many, many — I mean, really, millions of dollars over budget,"" and said the problems were because Pres. Obama ""wanted to be very politically correct and he didn't use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers that I love."" ""He wanted people that, like, never did it before and he's got a disaster on his hands,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation said the president's comments were not based in fact and said they believe he was referencing ""a relatively common dispute between two subcontractors over work that has already been completed."" ""Everyone who sees the Obama Presidential Center is blown away by its beauty, scale and the way it will be an economic engine for Chicago and a beacon of hope for the world,"" the foundation said in a statement. ""We look forward to welcoming all visitors to the 19.3-acre campus next spring, to experience a presidential center that not only honors the Obamas' legacy but also lifts up the next generation of leaders."" The center's website touts their use of union labor to build the center, which is privately funded and does not use taxpayer dollars. Construction has been ongoing throughout the often-harsh Chicago winter, and the foundation continues to expect that the Obama Presidential Center will open to the public in 2026. The Obama Presidential Center is a large complex on the city's South Side that includes a fruit and vegetable garden, athletic and events facility, a museum, an auditorium, a branch of the Chicago Public Library and more.

Supreme Court lets Trump enforce transgender military ban for now President Trump issued an executive order in January that targeted active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria. 13H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-transgender-military-ban/,Supreme Court clears way for Trump administration to enforce transgender military ban for now,"Washington — The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will allow the Trump administration to implement its policy barring transgender people from serving in the military while legal proceedings move forward. The high court agreed to pause a lower court order that had blocked the administration from implementing its ban nationwide. The Justice Department sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court left in place that district court's injunction. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would deny the administration's request. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cheered the Supreme Court's order as a ""massive victory"" and said in a social media post that President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ""are restoring a military that is focused on readiness and lethality – not DEI or woke gender ideology."" But Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign, which are representing the service members challenging the ban, reiterated their belief that the policy violates the Constitution and will ultimately be invalidated. ""Today's Supreme Court ruling is a devastating blow to transgender service members who have demonstrated their capabilities and commitment to our nation's defense,"" the groups said in a statement. ""By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice. Transgender individuals meet the same standards and demonstrate the same values as all who serve."" The policy stems from an executive order Mr. Trump signed in January that targeted active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria. The measure said the military's ""high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity and integrity"" are inconsistent with the ""medical, surgical and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria."" Mr. Trump's directive said the ""adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member."" SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit representing transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, has disputed that characterization, saying: ""Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve."" The president banned transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, and the Supreme Court allowed it to take effect in 2019. But former President Joe Biden revoked that policy when he took office in 2021. Following Mr. Trump's new executive order, Hegseth directed the Pentagon to pause new accessions for people with a history of gender dysphoria and halt gender-affirming medical procedures. The Defense Department then issued a new policy in February that disqualified people with gender dysphoria from military service unless they obtained a waiver. The branches had to start identifying and separating transgender service members by March 26. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. Between January 2016 and May 2021, roughly 1,892 service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon, according to the Congressional Research Service. A defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The Pentagon spent roughly $52 million on medical care to treat gender dysphoria between 2015 and 2024, according to a Defense Department memo. The Trump administration's ban led to legal challenges filed in Washington, D.C., and Tacoma, Washington. The case before the Supreme Court stems from the lawsuit brought in Tacoma on behalf of seven transgender service members, one transgender person who wants to join the military and an advocacy group. The plaintiffs argued the policy unconstitutionally discriminated against them based on sex and transgender status. A federal district court judge agreed in March to block implementation of the ban and required the Trump administration to reinstate the policy put in place by Biden. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit then declined to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and allow the administration to enforce the ban while litigation proceeds. The Justice Department had argued in a Supreme Court filing that Mr. Trump's policy draws classifications not based on transgender status and sex, but by medical condition, gender dysphoria. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote that the political branches have the authority to decide the composition of the armed forces, which the Pentagon exercised when it decided to exclude transgender people from military service. ""[I]f the separation of powers means anything, the government obviously suffers irreparable harm when an unelected judge usurps the role of the political branches in operating the nation's armed forces,"" Sauer wrote. He argued that the district court's injunction forces the military to maintain a policy — issued under the Biden administration — that the Pentagon found to be inconsistent with the interests of national security. But lawyers for the transgender service members said that allowing the Trump administration to enforce the ban would upend the status quo because it would clear the way for the government to start discharging thousands of transgender service members, ending their careers and hollowing out military units. ""The record is clear and indubitable: equal service by openly transgender servicemembers has improved our military's readiness, lethality, and unit cohesion, while discharging transgender servicemembers from our Armed Forces would harm all three, as well as the public fisc,"" referring to public finances, they wrote in a filing. The transgender members of the armed forces said that the ban is awash with animus toward transgender people and noted that while the Supreme Court allowed an earlier iteration to take effect during the first Trump administration, this policy is much broader as it would force the expulsion of every transgender service member. ""The ban was issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people — even in their personal lives — and rendering them unequal to others,"" they wrote.

Second judge blocks Trump administration's use of Alien Enemies Act A federal judge in New York said President Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act exceeded the scope of the law. 15H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-trump-alien-enemies-act-southern-district-of-new-york/,Second judge blocks Trump administration's use of Alien Enemies Act to remove certain migrants,"Washington — A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained in the Southern District of New York under President Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said in a 22-page decision that the president's March proclamation ordering the summary removal of Venezuelan migrants exceeded the scope of the Alien Enemies Act, an 1798 law that the Trump administration has relied on to deport noncitizens that his administration claims are part of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president the power to detain and deport migrants when there is a declared war between the U.S. and a foreign nation, or when there is an ""invasion"" or ""predatory inclusion"" against the U.S. by a foreign nation or government. But Hellerstein, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said that the Trump administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion or predatory incursion. Because of that, the Alien Enemies Act ""was not validly invoked by the presidential proclamation,"" he wrote. The judge said noncitizens in his judicial district can still be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the district court ""joined several others in correctly recognizing the president cannot simply declare that there's been an invasion and then invoke a wartime authority during peacetime to send individuals to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador without even giving them due process."" Hellerstein is the second federal judge to bar Trump administration officials from using the proclamation invoking the 1798 law to remove certain Venezuelan migrants at risk of deportation. U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, ruled last week that Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful and blocked administration officials from using the law and the president's proclamation to detain, transfer or remove Venezuelan migrants who either live or are detained in southern Texas. Challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act have been filed throughout the country in response to a Supreme Court decision last month that allowed removals under the law. But the high court said that Venezuelan migrants covered by the declaration are entitled to notice and the opportunity to challenge their confinement and removal under the Alien Enemies Act through habeas corpus proceedings brought in the district where they are being detained. The two-century-old law has only been employed previously during three periods of declared wars. But in March, Mr. Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the gang Tren de Aragua ""is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States."" Mr. Trump's proclamation said that all Venezuelan citizens who are at least 14 years old and in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to apprehension and removal as ""alien enemies."" The declaration claimed that the gang is undertaking ""hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare"" against the U.S. directly and at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's regime. But an April assessment from the National Intelligence Council obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation through a public records request found that ""while Venezuela's permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States."" The declassified assessment said that most of the intelligence community ""judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible."" The case before Hellerstein was brought by two plaintiffs — identified in filings as G.F.F. and J.G.O. — who were initially detained at the Orange County Jail in New York and were transferred to an immigration facility in Texas to be deported to El Salvador. But they were removed from a plane in response to temporary orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., as part of a challenge to Mr. Trump's efforts to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. That case ultimately landed before the Supreme Court. The two plaintiffs were returned to the jail, where they remain confined and ""under threat of imminent removal,"" according to Hellerstein's opinion. The migrants brought a challenge under habeas corpus in early April in the Southern District of New York on behalf of themselves and other noncitizens in the region at risk of deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, and Hellerstein agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from removing them from the U.S. under the president's proclamation unless they received a notice in English and Spanish and a hearing. His temporary order was to remain in place while he considered the Venezuelan migrants request for a preliminary injunction, which he granted Tuesday after finding that absent such relief, they would be deported to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. Hellerstein said that once there, ""they would endure abuse and inhumane treatment with no recourse to bring them back."" In his opinion, Hellerstein first called the notice provided by immigration officers to those subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act a ""fleeting affair"" and a ""bare bones form letter."" ""Petitioners have not been given notice of what they allegedly did to join TdA, when they joined, and what they did in the United States, or anywhere else, to share or further the illicit objectives of the TdA,"" Hellerstein wrote. ""Without such proof, petitioners are subject to removal by the executive's dictate alone, in contravention of the AEA and the constitutional requirements of due process."" The judge said that the procedures used by the Trump administration have already led to the wrongful removal of at least two migrants to CECOT. One of those migrants is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly removed to El Salvador as a result of an ""administrative error."" A federal judge, U.S. appeals court and the Supreme Court have said the U.S. has to facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody, but the Trump administration has claimed it's up to El Salvador to return him. Hellerstein also said that the grounds for Mr. Trump's proclamation — that Tren de Aragua has engaged in either a war, invasion or predatory incursion of the U.S. — ""do not exist."" ""There is nothing in the AEA that justifies a finding that refugees migrating from Venezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate the migrants, are engaged in an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion,'"" he wrote. ""They do not seek to occupy territory, to oust American jurisdiction from any territory, or to ravage territory. TdA may well be engaged in narcotics trafficking, but that is a criminal matter, not an invasion or predatory incursion."" The Trump administration can appeal the decision.

Department of Transportation is latest federal agency expecting layoffs Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy informed DOT employees during a town hall that the layoffs are expected soon. 17H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/department-of-transportation-layoffs-federal-agencies/,Department of Transportation is latest federal agency expecting layoffs,"Employees at the Department of Transportation are bracing for layoffs, as part of the Trump administration's effort to cut the federal workforce. During a town hall meeting last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy informed DOT employees that the layoffs — referred to as reduction in force, or RIF — are expected soon, DOT officials confirm to CBS News. An employee attending the town hall said Duffy did not offer specifics about which agencies or employees would be affected. The Department of Transportation said the final number of cuts would depend on how many employees first take a buyout offer. The cuts could happen as soon as the end of the month. The buyout offer, referred to as a deferred resignation program, allows workers to receive pay and benefits for several months if they agree to resign. Multiple federal agencies have made large-scale buyout offers as part of President Trump's effort to dramatically scale back the size of the federal government. Duffy has promised the DOT's workforce cuts won't affect airline safety. Duffy became Transportation Secretary amid two high-profile airline crashes, including a midair collision in January over the Potomac River in Washington that left 67 dead. On May 1, Duffy announced plans to boost air traffic controller recruiting. The announcement came as Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the country's largest and busiest hubs, experienced an onslaught of delays and canceled flights. Blaming staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions and system outages, the DOT's Federal Aviation Administration issued several ground delays and ground stops at the New Jersey airport. Arriving flights at the airport, located near New York City, have been delayed as long as six hours, while departures faced nearly four-hour delays. The FAA and the union representing air traffic controllers said Tuesday that multiple members are on trauma leave due to the equipment failure that caused them to lose communication with pilots.

"House GOP leaders look to reassure conference on ""big, beautiful bill"" momentum House GOP leaders stressed early this week that the budget package central to President Trump's agenda remains on track even as they acknowledged a delay. 15H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-budget-big-beautiful-bill-house-republicans-momentum/,"House GOP leaders look to reassure conference on momentum amid delays on Trump's ""big, beautiful bill""","Washington — House GOP leaders stressed early this week that the budget package central to President Trump's agenda remains on track even as they acknowledged a delay that comes amid simmering disagreements in the Republican conference that have threatened to stunt progress on reconciliation. ""It just made sense for us to push pause for a week to make sure that we do this right,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday at his weekly news conference. The committee work on budget reconciliation officially kicked off last week, as a number of panels considered their portions of the major package, which is aimed at addressing the president's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. But a handful of key committees have yet to schedule votes on their portions of the budget package, after Johnson said leaders made a decision to push the markups back a week, while disagreements persist over some of the most divisive elements of the forthcoming legislation — like an expansion to the state and local tax deduction and Medicaid cuts. Johnson on Tuesday expressed confidence that the lower chamber would complete its work by Memorial Day, a day after acknowledging to reporters that he put the package on a ""very ambitious time table"" and that the self-imposed deadline could slip past the holiday. ""We can pass that by Memorial Day. That was our original timeframe,"" he said. Committees face a May 9 deadline to complete their committee work under the budget resolution that the House and Senate adopted in April. But Johnson said the plan is to have committees complete their work and send the components of the bill to the House Budget Committee, which will incorporate the recommendations for the government's spending into a massive legislative package, by the end of next week. The House Energy and Commerce Committee had been targeting a Wednesday markup, but the panel has yet to schedule one. The House Ways and Means Committee and Agriculture Committee have yet to complete their work as well. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with identifying the biggest spending cuts — at least $880 billion over the next decade. The effort has become among the most closely watched in the reconciliation process, as Republicans look to dispel concerns about cuts to the popular entitlement program, stressing that they intend solely to root out waste, fraud and abuse, while some GOP hard-liners seek deeper spending cuts. Meanwhile, disagreements over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, have come before the Ways and Means Committee, as conservatives oppose a push to increase the cap from Republicans in blue states. Still, Ways and Means Committee chairman Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, said Sunday on Fox News that House Republicans will ""get the job done,"" adding that ""failure is simply not an option."" ""We're going to find the equilibrium point on SALT that no one will be totally delighted with, but it'll solve the equation, and we'll get it done,"" Johnson said Monday, referring to the deduction by its acronym. Johnson said Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump that day about budget reconciliation, and he noted that leadership is meeting with groups of members in the GOP conference on Tuesday as they try to push forward on the process. At his Tuesday news conference, Johnson was asked whether he has made assurances to the moderate and conservative factions of his conference that he can't keep. ""I don't make promises that I can't keep. This is a consensus building operation,"" he said. ""We've been working really hard to take all the input and find that kind of equilibrium point where everybody is at least satisfied. Some people are not going to be elated by every provision of the bill. It's impossible. The bill is one big, beautiful bill."" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told members in their morning meeting that they need to ""focus on the totality of the bill and not just individual details,"" according to Johnson. But Scalise also alluded to the plan slipping beyond Memorial Day, telling reporters Tuesday after the Republican conference meeting that ""we're on track to continue to deliver on this one big, beautiful bill and get it through the process and ideally to get it on the president's desk in June."" Lawmakers also cast doubt on whether they could meet the Memorial Day deadline. ""That's wishful thinking, I guess,"" Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, said. ""But you know, when I raised the speed limit in Tennessee to 70, I asked for 85. And 70 is what I wanted, so."" Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican, said ""the fact that we're having the conversation is good,"" but he added that ""we've got to act."" Meanwhile, House Democrats unveiled a discharge petition Tuesday, seeking to force a vote on legislation to prevent ""devastating cuts"" to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffies said with the discharge petition, House Democrats have ""given Republicans an opportunity to actually not simply talk about defending the best interests of the American people, but be about it."" ""The discharge petition is now live on the House floor,"" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said. ""All we need are four House Republicans to do the right thing."" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, filed the discharge petition on Tuesday, which would allow lawmakers to bypass House leadership to bring legislation to the floor for a vote. But with 213 Democrats in the chamber, four Republicans would need to join with them to secure a majority and move forward with the discharge petition. The underlying legislation the Democrats are seeking to force a vote on would prevent Congress from reducing enrollment or benefits for individuals enrolled in the Medicaid and SNAP programs, which offer health coverage and food assistance to low-income Americans.

"Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's ""act of war"" 1H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-pakistan-kashmir-strikes-sharif-revenge-modi/,"Pakistan's leader vows to avenge India's strikes, calling them an ""act of war""","Islamabad — India fired missiles into Pakistani-controlled territory in several locations early Wednesday, killing at least 26 people including a child, in what Pakistan's leader called an act of war. India said it struck infrastructure used by militants linked to last month's massacre of tourists in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. Pakistan said it had shot down several Indian fighter jets in retaliation as three planes fell onto villages in India-controlled Kashmir. At least seven civilians were also killed in the region by Pakistani shelling, Indian police and medics said. Tension has soared between the nuclear-armed neighbors since an attack in which gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, at a popular meadow in the disputed territory of Kashmir, in some cases killing men before their wives' eyes. India has blamed Pakistan for backing the attack, something Islamabad has denied. Kashmir, which is divided between the two countries but claimed in its entirety by each, has been at the center of tensions for decades and they have fought two wars over it. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Wednesday's airstrikes and said his country would retaliate. ""Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given,"" Sharif said. The country's National Security Committee met Wednesday morning, and Pakistan summoned India's charge d'affaires to lodge a protest. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a special meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security. A source told the Reuters news agency Modi postponed a trip to Croatia, the Netherlands and Norway. South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said it was one the highest-intensity strikes from India on its rival in years and that Pakistan's response would ""surely pack a punch as well."" ""These are two strong militaries that, even with nuclear weapons as a deterrent, are not afraid to deploy sizeable levels of conventional military force against each other,"" Kugelman said. ""The escalation risks are real. And they could well increase, and quickly."" Stephane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesperson, said in a statement late Tuesday that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint because the world could not ""afford a military confrontation"" between India and Pakistan. Several Indian states planned civil defense drills later Wednesday, according to India's home ministry, to train civilians and security personnel to respond in case of any ""hostile attacks,"" the ministry said in a statement. Such drills in India are rare in non-crisis times. Indian politicians from different political parties lauded the strikes. ""Victory to Mother India,"" India's defense minister, Rajnath Singh, wrote on X. India's main opposition Congress party called for national unity and said it was ""extremely proud"" of the country's army. ""We applaud their resolute resolve and courage,"" Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge said. India's army said the operation was named ""Sindoor,"" a Hindi word for the bright red vermillion powder worn by married Hindu women on their forehead and hair, referring to the women whose husbands were killed in front of them. India's missiles hit six locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in the country's eastern Punjab province, killing at least 26 people including women and children, said Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif. Officials said another 38 people were injured by the strikes, and another five people were killed in Pakistan during exchanges of fire across the border later in the day. Sharif said the Indian jets also damaged infrastructure at a dam in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, calling it a violation of international norms. India's Defense Ministry said the strikes targeted at least nine sites ""where terrorist attacks against India have been planned."" ""Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistan military facilities have been targeted,"" the statement said, adding that ""India has demonstrated considerable restraint."" Pakistan said the strikes hit at least two sites previously tied to banned militant groups. One hit the Subhan Mosque in Punjab's Bahawalpur city, killing 13 people including a child, according to Zohaib Ahmed, a doctor at a nearby hospital. The mosque is near a seminary that was once the central office of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group outlawed in 2002. Officials say the group has had no operational presence at the site since the ban. In a statement obtained by CBS News, Jaish-e-Mohammed's chief, Maulana Masood Azhar, claimed India's attack killed 10 of his family members and four close associates. He criticized Modi, saying, ""This cruelty has broken all limits—do not expect mercy anymore."" Another missile hit a mosque in Muridke, damaging its structure. A sprawling building located nearby served as the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba until 2013, when Pakistan banned the group and arrested its founder. Last month's attack on tourists was claimed by a group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance, which India says is also known as The Resistance Front and is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. In Muzaffarabad, the main city of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, resident Abdul Sammad said he heard several explosions as the blast ripped through houses. He saw people running in panic and authorities immediately cut power to the area. People took refuge on the streets and in open areas, fearful of what might happen. ""We were afraid the next missile might hit our house,"" said Mohammad Ashraf. Chaudhry Ghulam Rasool, who lives near the mosque, told CBS News, ""We were just about to go to bed when a huge blast happened. It was very big and terrifying explosions."" Along the Line of Control, which divides the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan, there were heavy exchanges of fire. The Indian police and medics said seven civilians were killed and 30 wounded by Pakistani shelling in Poonch district near the highly militarized Line of Control, the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir between the two countries. Officials said several homes also were damaged in the shelling. The Indian army said Pakistani troops ""resorted to arbitrary firing,"" including gunfire and artillery shelling, across the frontier. Shortly after India's strikes, aircraft fell onto three villages in India-controlled Kashmir. Sharif, the Pakistani military spokesperson, said the country's air force shot down five Indian jets in retaliation for the strikes. There was no immediate comment from India about Pakistan's claim. Debris from a plane was scattered across Wuyan village in the outskirts of the region's main city, including in a school and a mosque compound, according to Srinagar police and residents. Firefighters struggled for hours to douse the resulting fires. ""There was a huge fire in the sky. Then we heard several blasts also,"" said Mohammed Yousuf Dar, a Wuyan resident. Another aircraft fell in an open field in Bhardha Kalan village, near the Line of Control in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Village resident Sachin Kumar told The Associated Press he heard massive blasts followed by a huge ball of fire. Kumar said he and and several other villagers rushed to the scene and found two pilots with injuries. Both were later taken away by the Indian army. A third aircraft crashed in a farm field in India's northern Punjab state, a police office told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The officer did not provide further details. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, President Trump called the strikes ""a shame."" ""We just heard about it just as we were walking in the doors of the Oval,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I guess people knew something was going to happen based on a little bit of the past. They've been fighting for a long time. You know, they've been fighting for many many decades, and centuries actually, if you really think about it. No, I just hope it ends very quickly."" China called for restraint from both sides following India's strikes. ""China expresses regret over India's military actions this morning and is concerned about the current developments. China opposes all forms of terrorism,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said in a statement. ""We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritize peace and stability, remain calm and restrained, and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation."" Beijing is the largest investor in Pakistan by far, with a $65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project that spans across the country. China meanwhile also has multiple border claims disputed with India, with one of those claims in the northeastern part of the Kashmir region. French news agency AFP reports that British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio Wednesday the UK is ""a friend, a partner to both countries. We stand ready to support both countries. Both have a huge interest in regional stability, in dialogue, in de-escalation and anything we can do to support that, we are here and willing to do."" Moscow on Wednesday called for both India and Pakistan to show ""restraint,"" AFP says.","May 7, 2025 / 3:52 AM EDT / CBS/AP",N/A
When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? UPDATED 53M AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conclave-2025-when-will-cardinals-replace-pope-francis/,When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope? Here's how long it's taken to see white smoke in the past,"It's nearing decision time for the most senior members of the Catholic Church. The 133 cardinal electors due to choose a successor to the late Pope Francis gathered for a final Mass on Wednesday morning, just hours before they were to launch the secretive, centuries-old ritual known as the conclave to pick a new pontiff. Later Wednesday, the electors will be locked inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, where they will hold as many rounds of voting as prove necessary to select the next leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take. The conclave begins on Wednesday — 16 days after Pope Francis' death. It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years. In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials. The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices. The 133 electors participating this time around can hold one round of voting in the afternoon of the first day of the conclave, which consists of two ballots. To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day. From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options. There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved. The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The longest conclave on record took nearly three years. The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long — about 1,000 days — that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision. That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope — ""conclave,"" which translates to ""under lock and key"" — came from. After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271. There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history. The last three popes have been elected in two or three days. In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots. Vatican watcher John Allen, the editor of the Catholic news outlet Crux, believes this conclave may well follow that pattern, and we could expect a new pope to be named by the end of the week. After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected, black smoke rises from the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises. Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting. White smoke was first used in 1914, when Cardinals decided the light colored smoke should announce the selection of a new pope, Georgtown University reported. Now, to ensure the result of each ballot is clear, chemicals are burned alongside the ballots in each round to color the smoke black or white. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Truman has been lost in the Red Sea, a defense official confirmed to CBS News. The two pilots aboard the aircraft sustained minor injuries in the ordeal. The official said in a statement that the Super Hornet was attempting to land on the flight deck of the Truman Tuesday ""when an arrestment failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard."" An arrestment is the mechanism that a carrier uses to safely slow down and halt a fighter jet as it lands. ""Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 11,"" the official said. ""The aviators were evaluated by medical personnel and assessed to have minor injuries. No flight deck personnel were injured."" On April 28, a Super Hornet was being towed in the Truman hangar bay when crews lost control of the aircraft and it went overboard, along with the tow tractor. One sailor suffered minor injuries in the incident. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that initial reports suggested the jet may have fallen overboard after the carrier turned sharply while taking evasive action against Yemen's Houthi militants. Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said in statement that the Super Hornet that went into the Red Sea Tuesday ""was not struck by the Houthis."" The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several serious incidents since it deployed to the Middle East in September 2024. In December, the USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 which had taken off from the Truman. The two-person crew were able to safely eject. In February, the Truman accidentally collided with a merchant vessel near the Suez Canal. Also Tuesday, President Trump disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to a deal that would see them halt their attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. Those attacks started in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel.

Trump wants the Fed to cut rates today. Will it oblige? 15H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-rate-cut-jerome-powell-may-7-fomc-meeting/,Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will Jerome Powell oblige?,"President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been ""TOO LATE AND WRONG"" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision — but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction. The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty — costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out. ""The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,"" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email. He added, ""The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer."" Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7. The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day. Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. ""Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response — neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,"" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note. Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists. Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting. However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes. But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer. ""We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,"" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December. Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked. On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is ""NO INFLATION"" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon. But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined — gas costs are down 10% from a year ago — continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say. ""There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,"" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. ""No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates."" Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates. ""Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,"" he noted. ""When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards."" Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.

What U.S. Catholics are looking for in the next pope — CBS News poll 12H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-us-catholics-look-to-next-pope/,New pope could be elected in days. Here's what U.S. Catholics are looking for — CBS News poll,"In the eyes of U.S. Catholics, the next pope is going to have big — if not red — shoes to fill. Most say the Church is in touch with the needs of Catholics, a view that's higher today than when Pope Francis (who famously wore simple black shoes) became pontiff in 2013. Just before Francis' papacy, which today gets 76% approval, most U.S. Catholics said the Church was out of touch. As such, many U.S. Catholics would see the next pope continue Francis' teachings, and others would move toward still more progressive ones. Those who'd continue Francis' teachings tend to be younger. And by two to one, more U.S. Catholics overall say Francis' papacy left them feeling more connected to the Church than less. While most say it doesn't matter where the next pope comes from, plenty of U.S. Catholics — if given a choice — would like the next Pope to come from the U.S., their top choice out of other countries or regions. Hispanic Americans — who make up a third of US Catholics — also favor the U.S., but South America, Mexico and Central America are also noted. Most also want the next pope to be outspoken on world political issues. What kinds of changes are Catholics looking for? Most U.S. Catholics would look for a pope who is in favor of letting priests marry; of letting women be ordained as priests; and — overwhelmingly — for the use of birth control. But here again there are differences between the (smaller group of) regular churchgoers, and the larger group of U.S. Catholics who rarely or never go. These majority views are driven much more by the latter group, who also say the Church is out of touch with Catholics' needs — which may be one reason they'd seek a new pope in favor of changes such as these. Most U.S. Catholics want the next pope to continue to prioritize tradition in general, even as some specific things draw calls for change. And they have at least some confidence (if not a great deal) the conclave will choose a pope in touch with the needs of Catholics — this view is especially the case among the most frequent attendees. Those who think the Church is currently out of touch have comparably less confidence that the conclave will pick a pope who is. But the next pope will oversee a U.S. Catholic laity with some pronounced differences in views between a smaller group who say they attend Mass at least a few times per month — most of whom do think the Church is in touch — and a majority who say they attend only a few times a year or never, and think the Church is out of touch. And U.S. Catholics say they'll be paying attention. Most plan to follow news about the process and selection of a pope at least somewhat closely. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,298 adult Catholics living in the U.S. interviewed between April 30-May 5, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and Mass attendance according to the 2023-24 Pew Religious Landscape Study. The margin of error is ±3.8 points.

Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's industry ties 10H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-democrats-genius-act-stablecoin-crypto-bill-trump/,Senate Democrats rally against crypto bill amid criticism of Trump's ties to the industry,"Washington — Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week. The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance. The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday ""we need to start moving forward."" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. ""Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,"" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, ""Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption."" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. ""Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately."" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's ""serious risks"" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's ""assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest."" ""Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,"" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the ""single largest-ever investment in a crypto company"" and sets a ""historic precedent."" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.

"HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program 10H AGO",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hhs-revokes-some-layoff-notices-including-to-911-program/,"HHS revokes some layoff notices, including to 9/11 program","The Department of Health and Human Services formally revoked some layoff notices on Tuesday, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, restoring some staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Tuesday's letters to laid-off workers notifying them that their employment was being restored went a step further from some previous reinstatements touted by department officials, which often amounted only to a request for civil servants to continue working for a few more weeks to wind down or prepare to hand off their assignments. ""You previously received a notice regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) upcoming reduction in force (RIF). That notice is hereby revoked,"" read the letter received by some workers at the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides health care services to 9/11 first responders and survivors. A move last week to cut 15 employees of the 9/11 program, as part of a larger wave of eliminations that gutted most of the work from the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, prompted outcry from New York lawmakers. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. denied cutting the World Trade Center Health Program or NIOSH, which he said are slated to be merged into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America. ""Those programs were not terminated, as the media has reported. But they've simply been consolidated into a place that makes more sense,"" Kennedy said. Some of the FDA's laboratories also received notices Tuesday that they would be formally brought back to work as of Wednesday. Employees of the FDA's food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco all received notices that their layoffs were being reversed, though cuts to probationary workers in the labs have so far not been walked back. Letters to those scientists told them that their previous layoff notices were ""officially RESCINDED"" and that they would be expected to return to work on Wednesday. Not all of the workers that Kennedy or his department have promised to bring back to work have received notices restoring their jobs. Two other labs at the FDA — drug safety scientists in Puerto Rico and Detroit — have so far not received letters, multiple laid-off employees in the labs said. Employees of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health also remain off the job. Kennedy had said a month ago that he would restore the lead poisoning experts in the center, saying that some of the layoffs could have been mistakes. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more details on which teams were cut and which were being brought back. Tuesday's move to reverse some layoffs at HHS comes days after the department laid off hundreds more employees at the National Institutes of Health, blindsiding staff who had survived the initial wave of cuts in April. Layoffs included staff at the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Library of Medicine and Office of Research Facilities, two people said. NIH employees were told that the additional cuts were prompted by a need to reinstate scientists while also meeting strict layoff quotas sought by the department.

""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive.

One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition.","Updated on: May 6, 2025 / 8:42 PM EDT / AP",N/A

Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

5 charged after migrant boat capsized off San Diego coast,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-migrant-boat-human-smuggling/,5 charged after migrant boat capsizes off San Diego; Noem asks DOJ for death penalty,"Five Mexican nationals are facing charges after a small boat carrying more than a dozen people capsized off the coast of San Diego, killing three passengers, including a 14-year-old boy from India, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of California announced Tuesday. The boy's parents and two others were hospitalized following the human smuggling event, prosecutors confirmed in a news release. Nine other migrants were missing from the boat and were presumed dead, but authorities later located eight of them in Chula Vista, nearly 30 miles away from Del Mar, where the boat was found. A 10-year-old Indian girl, the boy's sister, remains missing, prosecutors said. ""The drowning deaths of these children are a heartbreaking reminder of how little human traffickers care about the costs of their deadly business,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said in a statement. U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday that there were originally 16 individuals on board, some of whom remain missing. Jesus Ivan Rodriguez-Leyva and Julio Cesar Zuniga-Luna were arrested on Monday at the beach where the overturned boat washed ashore, according to prosecutors. They were charged with Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Bringing in Aliens for Financial Gain, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday night announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty. ""Their deaths were not only avoidable but were also the direct result of the greed and indifference of smugglers who exploited them,"" Noem said in a statement, in part. ""Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, alien smuggling acts that result in death are capital crimes punishable by death. And under the Federal Death Penalty Act, those who intentionally participate in conduct knowing that it could result in the loss of life may be eligible for capital punishment."" Prosecutors said three other suspects — Melissa Jennelle Cota, Gustavo Lara and Sergio Rojas-Fregoso — were arrested late Monday night after Border Patrol agents in Chula Vista identified a vehicle seen at a beach in Del Mar and investigated. While the driver of said vehicle fled, officers located two other vehicles involved and found the missing migrants, according to prosecutors. Cota, Lara and Rojas-Fregoso were charged with Transportation of Illegal Aliens. Prosecutors said Rojas-Fregoso had been previously deported on Dec. 19, 2023. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. It was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles north of the Mexico border, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told The Associated Press. He said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. In 2023, eight people were killed when two boats capsized off the San Diego coast.
