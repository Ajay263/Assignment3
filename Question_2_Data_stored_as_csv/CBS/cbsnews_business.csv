These Chinese-made products could soon be hard to find in the U.S. A sharp drop in Chinese imports could lead to shortages of the following consumer products. 16H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinese-china-products-tariffs-shortages-us/,These Chinese-made products could soon be hard to find in the U.S.,"Shipments of Chinese goods to the U.S. are plunging, auguring potential supply-chain disruptions that could empty store shelves as early as this summer, some experts have warned. As U.S. tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports take hold, supplies of a broad range of products could start to dwindle later this summer as back-to-school and holiday spending heat up. Experts warn that the sharp decline in trade activity could lead to COVID-19 pandemic-like shortages of products, including goods assembled in the U.S. or elsewhere that use materials or inputs from China. Many American retailers rushed to build up their inventories ahead of President Trump's sweeping levies, leading to a recent spike in imports. Imports have since slowed, with a number of retailers foregoing orders on apparel, baby goods and other items that would typically be headed toward U.S. ports. ""Once this pull-forward effect fades, U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls and restocking challenges, especially for back-to-school and holiday goods,"" analysts with investment bank TD Cowen wrote in a research note that assessed the impact of tariffs on supply chains. ""Companies and products with high exposure to China and its manufacturing are most at risk of shortages,"" they added. The types of goods whose supplies were pulled forward as companies stocked up include computers, cars, cell phones and electric storage batteries, according to the financial firm. The financial firm cited data from the Port of Los Angeles, which along with the Port of Long Beach receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia. Following the pre-tariff spike in imports, container bookings from China to the U.S. have gone down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company. So-called ""blank sailings,"" or canceled voyages to the Port of Los Angeles rose to 17 in May, from just six in the month of April, TD Cowen found. There is a wide range of goods that U.S.-based sellers import from China and that are most at risk of becoming scarce because of the trade war. ""Among them, toys stand out as particularly vulnerable, raising concerns about potential shortages during the critical holiday season,"" TD Cowen analysts noted. Here are some products from China that could soon be hard to come by in the U.S. as a result of tariffs, according to TD Cowen's analysis. Down feathers: The U.S. imports $1.9 billion in down feathers from China. That amounts to 77% of the country's total imported supply of down. Down is commonly used for insulation in comforters and outerwear. Toys, games and sports equipment: More than $30 billion in toys, games and sports equipment sold in the U.S. is imported from China. That accounts for just over 73% of the country's total imports in the category. The trade war could spell shortages in children's toys come Christmastime, experts, as well as President Trump, have warned. Textile art: The U.S. imports $8.6 billion in textile art from China. That accounts for over half of all the textile art the country imports from abroad. Footwear: The U.S. is highly reliant on China for shoes. It imports $9.8 billion's worth, or 36% of footwear sold stateside. Sportswear giant Adidas for one, has warned that it expects to raise prices for U.S. customers because of tariffs. Cutlery: Dinner utensils manufactured in China could also start becoming scarce. The U.S. imports $3.1 billion in cutlery and metal tools from the country. Glassware: Almost 30% of U.S. imports of glassware and other products made of glass comes from China. Furniture and bedding: $18.5 billion's worth of furniture and bedding comes from China. That's 28% of all U.S. imports in the category. Apparel: $17.3 billion's worth of apparel is imported from China. That includes knit or crocheted clothing (almost $10 billion) and not-knit apparel ($7.3 billion). Beyond higher costs for consumer goods, businesses in a range of industries could face other tariff-related challenges, TD Cowen found. For example, the U.S. imports $124 billion in electric machinery; $82 billion in nuclear reactors, boilers and other machinery; $12 billion in goods made of iron or steel; and $19.3 billion in plastics from China each year, according to data from the International Trade Administration.

Flying without a Real ID? Here's what to know at the airport 13H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/real-id-flying-airport-what-to-know/,Flying without a Real ID? Here's what to know at the airport,"It's a nightmare for any traveler: getting to the airport and not having their ID. For many Americans, a version of that headache will become a reality starting Wednesday when the federal government begins enforcing requirements for Real ID, a national set of standards for state-issued identification documents such as driver's licenses. The Transportation Security Administration said that starting Wednesday, it will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID requirements. ""TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimize operational disruptions at airports,"" Adam Stahl, a TSA senior official who's performing the duties of the agency's administrator, said in a statement last month. The agency said people who are in the U.S. illegally and are voluntarily self-deporting on international flights will still be allowed to board planes. Five states — Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington — issue enhanced IDs, which can be used to cross the U.S. border in a vehicle. The TSA said enhanced IDs are an acceptable form of identification at airport checkpoints. According to the TSA, 81% of travelers provide an acceptable ID at security checkpoints. But a CBS News data analysis in April found that at least 17 states were less than 50% compliant with Real ID requirements, and 30 states were less than 70% compliant, setting the stage for potential disruptions at checkpoints across the country. There is hope for people who don't have an updated driver's license, state ID card or enhanced ID. The TSA said other forms of identification can be shown at checkpoints. Here's a list of those other acceptable IDs: The TSA noted that the list is subject to change without notice. The agency also said temporary driver's licenses aren't an acceptable form of ID. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday told lawmakers what will happen when passengers present their ID to a TSA officer. ""If it's not compliant, they may be diverted to a different line, have an extra step, but people will be allowed to fly,"" Noem told a House Appropriations subcommittee. ""We will make sure that it is as seamless as possible and that travelers will get to stay on their intended itinerary, but we are telling people that this law will be enforced."" The TSA said people without an acceptable ID may have to have their identity verified by providing information such as their name and current address. Passengers with confirmed identities may then be subjected to additional screening. People without confirmed identities won't be allowed to go through security. Last month, a source familiar with the procedure told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that the identity verification process is similar to what happens when people have their ID stolen on vacation. People who intend to have their identity verified at the airport should plan to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight instead of the recommended two hours, according to the source. The goal will be to move people with noncompliant IDs to a separate area quickly so security lines don't get backed up, the source told Van Cleave. A Real ID card has a star marking at the upper-right part of the card, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The TSA doesn't require children under 18 to have an ID when traveling within the U.S. The agency urges passengers to check if their airline requires IDs for children.

Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will it oblige? 16H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-rate-cut-jerome-powell-may-7-fomc-meeting/,Trump wants the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. Will Jerome Powell oblige?,"President Trump has been pushing the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing on social media last month that the central bank has been ""TOO LATE AND WRONG"" in holding off on further reductions. Now, the Fed is set to meet on Wednesday to make its next rate decision — but Mr. Trump may need to wait longer to get his cuts. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch. The group pegs the likelihood at 97% that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the same level that it's been at since December, when the central bank made its most recent reduction. The Fed's meeting comes at a time when the U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, with GDP unexpectedly falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth topped forecasts in April. At the same time, Wall Street economists are hiking their recession risk for the U.S. economy due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have hit imports from China with a 145% import duty — costs that are largely passed onto American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Fed has signaled it will take a wait-and-see approach, with Powell saying at a speech last month that the central bank can stay patient while tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out. ""The Fed and investors find themselves in a no man's land waiting to see whether economic policies drive prices higher and growth lower,"" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in an email. He added, ""The reality is that corporate earnings have been pretty strong, the U.S. economy barreling along and the biggest cause for concern is sentiment. There isn't a good reason to change rates at this point, and the Fed is likely to reiterate the need for more data with three rate cuts priced in for 2025, at this point starting in the summer."" Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member group that sets rate decisions, will meet on May 6-7, with the Fed announcing the FOMC's decision on May 7. The Fed will announce the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on May 7, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to discuss the committee's decision at a press conference at 2:30 p.m. EST that day. Very slim, with economists projecting 97% odds that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. ""Criticism from President Trump will not trigger a Fed policy response — neither an early cut without evidence of labor market deterioration, nor a stubborn refusal to cut once the labor market does soften, provided long-term inflation expectations remain anchored,"" noted Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius in a May 6 research note. Consumers eager for relief on borrowing costs are likely going to face a wait, according to economists. Following the May 7 meeting, the Fed will next meet on June 18, with economists currently expecting the central bank to also hold steady then, according to CME FedWatch. Its polling finds a 70% likelihood that the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.5% at that meeting. However, it's more likely the Fed could slash rates at its July 30 meeting, with the probability of a rate cut sitting currently at 80%, FedWatch notes. But some economists expect the central bank to hold off even longer. ""We think the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates next year, as tariff-induced inflation begins to fade and the labor market shows more troubling signs,"" noted Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Ryan Sweet, who says he believes the first cut will occur in December. Mr. Trump argues that inflation has steadily cooled and high borrowing costs are no longer needed to restrain price increases. The Fed sharply ramped up its short-term rate in 2022 and 2023 as pandemic-era inflation spiked. On Friday, Mr. Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social that there is ""NO INFLATION"" and claimed that grocery and egg prices have fallen, and that gas has dropped to $1.98 a gallon. But those claims are not entirely true: Grocery prices have jumped 0.5% in two of the past three months and are up 2.4% from a year ago. Gas and oil prices have declined — gas costs are down 10% from a year ago — continuing a longer-running trend that has continued in part because of fears the economy will weaken. Still, AAA says gas prices nationwide average $3.18 a gallon. Borrowers who are looking for relief on loan and credit card rates will have a wait ahead of them, experts say. ""There's just so much uncertainty in the economy now,"" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in an email. ""No one quite knows what the next few months will look like, but what does seem clear is that Americans are going to have wait at least a little longer for the Fed to cut rates."" Schulz predicts that credit card rates could tick higher in the next few months, as well as auto loan rates. ""Banks are nervous about all of the uncertainty in the economy and what it means for consumers,"" he noted. ""When that happens, banks try to minimize risk as much as possible, and one of the ways they do that is to raise interest rates on credit cards."" Because of that, consumers should focus on shopping around for the best rates they can find, as well as considering transferring existing high-interest credit card debt to 0% balance transfer cards, Schulz added.

Grand Theft Auto 6 drops a surprise second trailer. Here are all the details. 16H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gta-6-trailer-2-release-grand-theft-auto-rockstar-vice-city/,Grand Theft Auto 6 drops a surprise second trailer. Here are all the details.,"Grand Theft Auto 6 has dropped a surprise second trailer just days after Rockstar Games said it's pushing back the game's much-anticipated release until May 2026. The second trailer provides more details about the game's storyline, which involves its first-ever female protagonist, Lucia. The roughly 3-minute clip shows her partner, Jason, as he meets her when she's released from prison. The two are shown engaging in some criminal activities, such as holding up a business while wearing masks and carrying weapons. ""Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,"" states Rockstar's description for the second trailer. ""But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."" The game, known as GTA to fans, had originally been slated for a 2025 release, but Rockstar said last week that it would push that back to May 26, 2026. Fans have already been waiting more than a decade for a new title, with the most recent version of the game, GTA 5, released in 2013. With GTA 5 having sold more than 200 million copies, expectations are high for GTA 6, with Wedbush Securities forecasting sales of $6.35 billion in sales for fiscal year 2026. The second trailer, which was released about 17 months after the game's first trailer, introduces more of the backstory between its main characters, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Jason is described as growing up ""around grifters and crooks,"" but after some time in the Army, he moved to the Keys to work for local drug runners. Lucia, meanwhile, ended up in the Leonida Penitentiary after ""fighting for her family,"" the website says. Other characters include Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, and Boobie Ike, who has used his street smarts to build a business empire including ""real estate, a strip club and a recording studio,"" the site says. Along with the trailer, Rockstar Games also released new screenshots of the game on its website, featuring new characters and a number of locations, including Vice City — the fictional city inspired by Miami — and Leonida Keys, which bears a resemblance to the Florida Keys. ""Literally the best graphics I've ever seen,"" wrote YouTuber Jake Randall on X about the new trailer.

Flowers for Mother's Day may be more expensive due to Trump's tariffs 13H AGO,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flower-prices-mothers-day-trump-tariffs/,Flowers for Mother's Day may be more expensive due to Trump's tariffs,"With Mother's Day approaching, you may be looking to buy a bouquet of flowers — and prices could be higher due to tariffs enacted by President Trump. ""We're going to do the best we can to sort of keep those prices where they need to be. But people can definitely expect to be paying a little bit more,"" said Jody Costello, a florist in Royal Oak, Michigan. While Mr. Trump paused hefty tariffs he announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere. Last year, the U.S. imported $2.2 billion worth of cut flowers and greenery, the bulk of which came from Colombia and Ecuador, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. ""The fact that they can grow year-round gave them a natural advantage,"" said Kate Penn, CEO of the Society of American Florists. Penn said domestically, small growers — many of whom have an acre or less — have flourished since the COVID-19 pandemic, selling at farmers' markets and to a blossoming wedding industry. ""The consumer does want to buy local, especially brides,"" she said. ""They love to be able to have local flowers featured."" But even small growers like Moonshot Farm in East Windsor, New Jersey, aren't immune to the fallout from tariffs. Moonshot Farm owner Rebecca Kutzer-Rice said some of the bulbs she uses to grow flowers are imported from Italy and Holland. She just received her first few shipments to be hit with the 10% tariffs. ""We're estimating it could cost our small business anywhere from $40,000 to $50,000 a year, which for a small farm is almost the equivalent of like a salary of another employee,"" she said. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers. Mistine Boren, a florist in Austin, Texas, told CBS affiliate CBS19, she's waiting until after Mother's Day to decide if she'll raise prices. ""It's tough,"" she said. ""Our margins are so thin already, and especially when it comes to buying fresh flowers, it's a big splurge and expense for people."" Boren said she's also trying to source more wild, local flowers to avoid the tariffs. Consumers may just need to be a little more flexible about what types of flowers they buy, but they can still get quality bouquets, Penn said. ""There literally are countless substitutions and florists are just masters at creating something that's still gonna make a big impact,"" she said.

"Social Security to cut overpayment clawbacks to 50%, down from 100% MAY 5",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-overpayment-clawback-change-50-percent-doge/,"Social Security to reduce overpayment clawbacks to 50%, down from 100%","The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries. In an April 25 ""emergency message"" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up sharply from the prior rate of 10%. The agency didn't explain its reason for the change, nor immediately respond to a request for comment. The 100% clawback policy was directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency. Dudek said in a March 7 press release that the change was needed to ""properly safeguard taxpayer funds."" The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration. The agency's inspector general found that 73,000 overpayments in 2022 were due to problems with Social Security's own calculations, rather than the fault of the beneficiary. ""SSA's automated systems could not compute benefit payments due in certain situations, and the Agency did not provide employees with a comprehensive tool to use when they had to manually calculate them. Without adequate automation tools, employees can make errors,"" the inspector general said in a report. Last year, the Biden administration capped the clawback rate at 10% after reports that some seniors and disabled beneficiaries had been forced into financial hardship, including homelessness, due to the prior 100% clawback rate. But that 10% rate was only effective for about a year, with the the agency returning it to a 100% rate in March. Those most at risk from the government's stepped-up effort to recover overpayments are the roughly one-third of Social Security recipients who rely on their monthly benefit check for at least 75% of their income. Some seniors have told CBS News they were left too financially strapped to afford rent, food and other basics. Many of the overpayments involve disabled workers who receive payments through the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, whose recipients receive an average of $1,538 per month, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. One SSA report found that SSDI has a higher rate of overpayments than the overall Social Security program because disabled recipients sometimes fail to report work income, which can occur if they're not aware they need to disclose extra earnings to the agency. Social Security reduces benefits for disabled recipients who earn more than $1,620 a month. ""While walking back the clawback of overpayments from 100% to 50% is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI,"" Adcock told CBS MoneyWatch. He added, ""A fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income. That means some SSDI recipients are still going to have trouble paying for rent, food, utilities and prescriptions"" with the 50% clawback rate. The Social Security Administration docked the the benefits of about 670,000 recipients by 10% for overpayment last year, according to KFF. Under the new rule, the 50% clawback for overpayments started April 25, according to the SSA's statement.

"Tariffs could put them under, some small business owners say MAY 5",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariff-small-businesses-future-jeopardy-price-hikes/,"Tariffs could put them under, some small business owners say","Uncertainty around President Trump's ever-changing tariff agenda is already hitting small businesses hard, and threatening their very survival, operators say. With baseline 10% taxes on all imported goods in effect and country-based levies looming, business operations have become significantly more challenging for the U.S.' nearly 35 million smaller enterprises, owners told CBS MoneyWatch. One of the most pressing challenges they face? Setting prices high enough to absorb the cost of new duties on imports without driving customers away. Thirty percent of small business owners surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business in March said they planned to increase prices — the greatest share reported over the past year, an analysis by the Joint Economic Committee found. Raising prices is one way to offset rising costs, while trimming expenses — including by reducing labor costs — is the other alternative. Employment at small businesses with fewer than 10 employees declined by 3% — or 366,400 jobs — since President Trump took office, the JEC found. That compares with a 1.2% increase in hiring by small businesses in the first months of President Biden's term, and a 0.1% decrease in the first months of President Trump's first term, the JEC found. Shayai Lucero, owner of Earth and Sky Floral Designs, a small floral design business in Laguna, New Mexico, said she imports a high volume of flowers from Canada, Columbia Ecuador and Peru. Because she's located in the desert, local farms and gardens can't produce flowers year-round. Lucero recently experienced what she called ""the sharpest price increase"" she's seen in her 16 years in the flower business, when the price of a single rose went from between 65 cents to 84 cents per stem to a range of $1.89 to $2.44. ""We received emails from several different farms we work with that said after Mother's Day the tariff prices are going to go into effect,"" Lucero told CBS MoneyWatch. She's increased her prices as a result, with wrist corsages typically sold for $40, now priced at $50. ""That's not nearly enough of what I should have charged, but because my clientele is not wealthy, I had to take that into account if would people purchase from me or would they go elsewhere?"" said Lucero, adding that as her own costs skyrocket, the future of her business is uncertain. ""I have been transparent with customers to try to get them to understand, but if it gets to be too much, I may have to close,"" she said. ""This is a whole different atmosphere."" Few businesses are immune to tariffs, but smaller establishments, which tend to operate on thin margins, are among the most vulnerable. Some bigger businesses imported goods ahead of tariffs going into effect, stockpiling inventory. With less cash on hand, small businesses did not have the same ability. ""Small business owners are innovative, driven and scrappy — they often operate on razor-thin margins and are constantly finding new ways to grow,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement. ""But President Trump's tariffs are needlessly causing immense uncertainty for small business owners, forcing them to make layoffs, increase prices for their customers and even close their doors,"" she added. Mike Roach, who co-owns Paloma Clothing, a 50-year-old womenswear store in Portland, Oregon, sells labels that are primarily manufactured in India and China. He placed orders for a new season's worth of merchandise three to five months ago, before tariffs on either country were in effect. Today, tariffs as high as 145% apply to goods from China, while a 10% baseline levy is in place on goods entering the U.S. from India. ""The companies we deal with are going through conniptions trying to figure out what they're going to do. At that level, Chinese goods, are pretty much unsaleable,"" he said. ""That's a huge threat to the future of our business."" Roach hopes his store's 50th year in business isn't its last, but it's a potential reality he's facing. ""This is the worst and most uncertain situation we've ever been in,"" he said. ""This is way worse than anything else in terms of not knowing what to do and what the future is going to hold because of the uncertain factor.""

"IRS has lost 31% of its auditors after DOGE cuts, report says MAY 5",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/irs-doge-cuts-layoffs-31-percent-auditors-tax-revenue-impact/,"The IRS has lost almost one-third of its tax auditors after 2 months of DOGE cuts, report says","The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, said on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts ""in addressing waste and fraud"" will ""get the country back on track."" The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found. But revenue agents — the IRS workers who perform audits — have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say. ""You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,"" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS. She added, ""You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing."" Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, ""The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve."" The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report. While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors. Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called ""probationary workers,"" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said. Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said. And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing. The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added. The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department. DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service. DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said. The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab. ""The argument from DOGE is to save money — that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,"" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction ""simply doesn't make sense,"" she said.

The Real ID deadline is approaching fast. Here's what to know. MAY 5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/real-id-deadline-may-7-tsa/,The Real ID deadline is just around the corner. Here's what to know.,"The Real ID deadline is rapidly approaching. Americans will be required to switch to the enhanced form of identification by Wednesday, May 7, if they want to travel by plane domestically. If you still need to update your ID you're not alone: CBS data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance. An analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that 30 states are less than 70% compliant. Out of all states, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation at 17%. Here's what you need to know to make sure you're ready for the May 7 Real ID deadline. The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner. The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear. Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport. Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities — including TSA checkpoints — enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification. That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license. The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government ""set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009. You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website. Five states — Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont — issue what is called an Enhanced Driver's License (EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card. Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word ""Enhanced"" at the top of the card. Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically. Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport — something you can't do with a regular Real ID. Prices vary by state. In New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a ""one-time $30 Real ID fee"" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs. It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs. Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID. Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments. A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security. TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning approximately four out of every five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or another valid form of identification. ""We don't have concerns at this point about this deadline really impacting operations, especially for those people who again are prepared and have everything they're supposed to have,"" Jessica Mayle, a public affairs specialist at TSA, told CBS Philadelphia. If you don't have a Real ID, TSA has a list of other valid forms of identification you can use to get through an airport checkpoint. This includes passports, permanent resident cards, Enhanced IDs and Global Entry cards. No. You will still need a valid passport to travel outside of the country and go on international cruises.

"Tracking rising cost of cars, trucks, groceries ahead of Trump's tariffs CBS News is tracking the rising cost of products most impacted by tariffs imposed and soon-to-be-imposed by President Trump, from grocery items to cars and trucks. APR 2",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-price-tracker/,"As Trump announces new tariffs, here's a price tracker for cars, groceries and more supplies","CBS News is tracking the already sharply rising cost of products most impacted by tariffs imposed and new ones announced by President Trump on April 2, from the cost of common grocery items to the the purchase and operation of cars and trucks. We will continue updating the weekly prices of groceries and the monthly costs of new vehicles, used vehicles, parts, repairs, insurance premiums and construction and manufacturing raw materials. Economists and other experts say consumers can expect to see higher prices for imported items targeted by the latest round of tariffs in the coming weeks and months. Perhaps the most impacted day-to-day purchases for American families will be at the grocery store, where a large share of our most commonly purchased fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico, Canada, China and other countries facing tariffs. Experts suggest the cost of those tariffs will be passed on to consumers in the grocery checkout lane. We examined the prices for fruits, vegetables and juices that are primarily imported from other countries, according to USDA data. The average prices are drawn from weekly surveys that the Agriculture Department conducts at hundreds of stores across the country. We've tracked the weekly price data from 2020 through last week. The cost of owning and operating a car or truck in the United States is a major focus ahead of the threatened White House tariffs on vehicles manufactured in other countries — a change experts predict will add thousands more to the cost of ownership, parts, repairs and insurance. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, supply-chain interruptions and the inflation that followed, the price of buying new and used cars rose sharply. So did the cost of parts, repairs and insurance. The charts show the price as an index — the percentage above a baseline. For new and used vehicles, we're using an example of a small SUV to translate the percentages into dollars to explain the recent years' change. Used car prices spiked after the COVID pandemic because major supply chain disruptions and a global computer chip shortage severely slowed down new vehicle production. In some cases, late-model used vehicle prices soared to nearly the same as new models of the same or similar vehicles. Some of the same phenomenon drove up the price of auto parts, and consequently, consumers' bills at repair shops. In addition to the rising cost of repairs, labor shortages, driving habits and increasing crash trends have driven up the cost of automobile insurance premiums, aggravating the total cost of owning and operating personal cars and trucks. Baked into the cost of everything from homebuilding to the manufacture of durable goods like appliances are the cost of core supplies like steel and aluminum, which are also targeted by the administration's tariffs.

"Americans fear going broke in retirement more than death, study finds Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying. APR 23",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-retirement-death-savings-allianz/,"Americans are more scared of going broke in retirement than they are of death, study finds","Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death. That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death. ""It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,"" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022. Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances. Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire. ""Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,"" said LaVigne. Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement. Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said. Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency. LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. ""You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,"" he said.

"Here's the magic number Americans say they need for retirement Americans have big financial goals for what they think they'll need for a comfortable retirement, a new survey finds. APR 18",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-savings-how-much-do-you-need-magic-number/,How much money do you need to retire? Here's what Americans say is their magic number.,"Whether you're fast approaching retirement or have decades to prepare, the question of how much to save can be daunting. Yet Americans have a goal in mind for what's needed to finance a comfortable retirement: $1.26 million. That's according to a new study by Northwestern Mutual, which surveyed more than 4,500 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. While $1.26 million may seem unattainable to many, it represents a scaled-down ambition from last year's survey, when workers pegged their ideal retirement needs at $1.46 million. The reason for the scaled-down financial goal comes down to cooling inflation, which has tempered workers' expectations for their retirement needs, researchers at Northwestern Mutual said. Since touching a pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has gradually eased, dropping last month to 2.4% on an annual basis. ""The inflation rate has been falling, and we're starting to see people's expectations for retirement savings soften, too,"" said Melinda Wilke, a wealth management advisor at Northwestern Mutual. But that's not to say inflation has disappeared from the equation altogether. ""Obviously a reduced inflation rate is good news,"" said David John, a senior policy advisor at AARP. ""But we are still seeing many people who are very concerned that prices are going to continue to go up, and what that means for how long their retirement savings will last."" John added that concern about the fate of the Social Security program — which currently provides monthly payments to more than 70 million Americans — is top of mind for many Americans the nonprofit works with. Even after years of saving, a majority say they're worried they could still come up short in retirement. Fifty–one percent of those surveyed said they think it's somewhat or very likely that they could run out of retirement savings. Despite having lofty goals for their retirement nest eggs, many workers are falling short. According to the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, the most recent data available, Americans had median retirement savings of $87,000. Americans also express generational differences when it comes to retirement — and the nation's youngest adults have the biggest aspirations, the study found. About 63% of Gen Z — whose oldest members are now in their early to mid-20s — say they believe they will be financially prepared for retirement. That's far higher than the millennial or baby boomer generation, with their confidence at 54% and 56%, respectively. Part of this, Wilke said, is due to an interest in wealth building among Gen Z. ""FinTok, meme stocks and cryptocurrency piqued their interest,"" the wealth management advisor said. Gen Z also started their retirement planning earlier than other generations, with members of the group starting to save at the average age of 24, with the goal of leaving the workforce at 61. In contrast, older generations started saving much later, with boomers beginning at an average age of 37 and with plans to retire at 72. The least confident generation is Gen X, or workers between about 45 to 60 years old, with only 46% saying they believe they'll hit retirement in good financial shape, the survey found. Gen X could be described as ""Generation AnXiety,"" Wilke added. As the first generation of U.S. workers to lean on 401(k) plans as a primary means of saving, they're generally more underprepared for retirement than other generations, with about half telling Natixis last year that they'd need a miracle to retire. Retirement savings can vary, depending on age — NerdWallet offers a handy breakdown — but overall, about one in four Americans with retirement savings say they've put aside one year or less of their current annual income, the Northwestern Mutual survey found. Building a $1.26 million retirement fund is easier if you start young. Workers who begin to save at age 20 would need to sock away $330 per month to reach $1.26 million, while people starting at age 30 would need to save $695 per month, according to Northwestern Mutual. Still, saving will look different for everyone, experts say. John from AARP outlined a few considerations for people to keep in mind as they map out their retirement plan, including: Mary Cunningham is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch.

3 questions to ask about your retirement savings when stocks plunge The first weeks of the new Trump administration have sparked stock market jitters and recession fears. Here's advice from top experts. MAR 17,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stock-market-investing-401k-recession-how-to-prepare-for-retirement/,Worried how the stock market could impact your retirement? Here are 3 questions from experts.,"Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire — a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year. But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets or rising recession risks because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say. Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called ""correction"" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday. The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say. ""First of all, you aren't alone — a lot of people are panicking,"" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action."" The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report. ""Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,"" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. ""One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics."" Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account. It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say. Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time. ""How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically — all of that is completely valid to consider,"" TIAA's Ornstein said. But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment. ""Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have"" to manage that risk, he noted. Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement. But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said. ""Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 — they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover"" before they retire, he noted. ""But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years."" He added, ""We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change."" In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan. More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research has found. Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said. ""Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,"" he said. When markets head south, ""It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments."" For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries. And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund. Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law. ""The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,"" she said. ""Now is the time to find out how to build that up.""

"What has DEI actually done for U.S. workers and employers? President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved? JAN 28",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-corporate-programs/,"What has DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — done for U.S. workers and employers?","President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies. DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity. This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as ""illegal and immoral,"" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave. DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation. Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism. But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees. ""DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'"" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool."" In defining DEI, Glasgow described ""diversity"" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. ""It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,"" he said. Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status. ""These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,"" she explained. The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work. ""It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,"" Fulton said. ""It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive."" Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton. ""It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,"" Fulton said. Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford, Harley Davidson, McDonald's, Meta and more. Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues. Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. ""It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,"" he said. ""It also depends on what you are trying to achieve."" One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired — patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness. By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool. Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line. ""The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,"" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. ""The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry."" In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management — women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015. ""[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,"" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.

Minnesota, with a thriving health care industry, ranked third. Its workers also have good access to health care and retirement benefits. Jobs are harder to come by in states such as West Virginia, Louisiana, Indiana, Kentucky, and Alaska, according to WalletHub. ""These are very low-income, rural states, and a lot of work there is usually seasonal,"" Lupo said.

"Want to work at Chipotle? Be prepared to chat with AI. Chipotle plans to deploy a conversational AI hiring system, dubbed ""Ava Cado,"" across more than 3,500 restaurants. OCT 22, 2024",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chipotle-ava-cado-ai-hiring/,Chipotle turns to AI hiring platform to screen job applicants,"Chipotle Mexican Grill job applicants better get used to conversing with AI — their first interview could be with an artificial intellgence-powered system named ""Ava Cado"" rather than a human hiring manager. The fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain said Tuesday that it is partnering with Paradox, a maker of what the technology company calls ""conversational"" AI, to launch the new hiring platform. By collecting basic information about candidates, Ava will free up restaurant managers to focus on other tasks, according to the company. The AI can also schedule interviews and even make job offers in real time, the company said. Ava is also a polyglot and able to conduct interviews in English, Spanish, French and German. The new technology is expected to reduce the amount of time it takes Chipotle to hire an employee for an in-restaurant position by as much 75%, Chipotle said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. Chipotle plans to deploy the system across more than 3,500 restaurant locations in North America and Europe. The technology is currently being introduced at restaurants in a phased approach that's expected to be complete by the end of October. In addition to collecting biographical information, Ava can engage with job applicants and answer their questions about the company, according to Chipotle. ""Paradox operates as if we've hired additional administrative support for all our restaurants, freeing up more time for managers to support team members and provide an exceptional guest experience. We're excited about the early improvements we're seeing,"" Chipotle chief human resources officer Ilene Eskenazi said in a statement. A number of other major restaurant chains, retailers and other companies have turned to Paradox's AI hiring tech, including Applebee's, McDonald's, Panera Bread, Taco Bell and Wendy's. Although AI can expedite the hiring process, it can also be controversial as a recruiting tool. Some studies have found that it can lead to biased assessment of candidates and unintentionally discriminate against people based on their race or gender. To guard against the misuse of AI in hiring, New York City in 2021 passed a law that requires companies that use the technology to disclose its use to job candidates. Employers are also required to conduct annual third-party ""bias audits"" of their automated hiring systems to ensure the technology isn't discriminating against certain types of candidates.

Cartel leader among 16 arrested in historic U.S. fentanyl bust,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fentany-bust-arrests-justice-department-pam-bondi/,"Sinaloa cartel leader among 16 arrested in historic U.S. fentanyl bust, Justice Department says","Sixteen people have been arrested and three million pills laced with fentanyl were seized in what federal prosecutors said Tuesday was the ""largest fentanyl bust in DEA history."" The operation, which spanned several states along in the West, ""marks the most significant victory in our nation's fight against fentanyl and drug trafficking to date,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said. Among those arrested was a Sinaloa cartel leader, Heriberto Salazar Amaya, 36, a Mexican national, who was taken into custody in Salem, Oregon, Bondi said at a press conference. In February, the State Department designated the Sinaloa cartel as a foreign terrorist organization. Asked whether any of those arrested would be deported to Mexico, Bondi said ""I want them to stay in our prisons as long as possible."" ""Most of these individuals, if convicted, will remain in American prisons, perhaps Alcatraz,"" the attorney general added in reference to the shuttered California prison that President Donald Trump said he wants to reopen. The Justice Department said law enforcement officials seized more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of fentanyl pills, 11.5 kilos of fentanyl powder, 80 kilos of methamphetamine, 7.5 kilos of cocaine and 4.5 kilos of heroin. The bust also netted $5 million in cash and 49 rifles and pistols, U.S. officials said, while releasing several images of the seized items. ""This case represents DEA's largest single seizure of fentanyl pills,"" said Robert Murphy, the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Bondi said 75,000 Americans are dying each year because of fentanyl and it is the number one cause of death for people between the ages of 18 and 34 in the United States. ""They are flooding our cities with a weapon of mass destruction, fentanyl,"" she said. Ryan Ellison, U.S. attorney for the district of New Mexico, said the ""sophisticated fentanyl and narcotics distribution network"" spanned New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Utah. Ellison said the 16 people arrested face various federal charges including conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and firearms offenses. The DEA says drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 44, though most states have seen fewer deaths over the last few years. Between 2022 and 2023, overdose deaths decreased by 4% nationwide, marking the first such decline since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. Overdose deaths fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024.","Updated on: May 7, 2025 / 6:24 AM EDT / CBS/AFP",N/A
"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-may-soon-deport-migrants-to-libya/,"Trump administration may soon deport migrants to Libya, U.S. officials say","The Trump administration may soon start deporting migrants to Libya, expanding its mass deportation campaign to the troubled North African country, two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday. The deportations, expected to be operated by the U.S. military, could start as early as this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal government plans. Libya is one of several far-flung nations the U.S. government has been asking to accept deportations of migrants from third countries, CBS News reported earlier this week. The possibility of U.S. deportations to Libya, reported earlier Tuesday by Reuters, is a stunning proposition given the deep political and social turmoil the North African country finds itself in, as well as its human rights record. Since a civil war erupted in 2011, Libya has been plagued by armed conflict and political tumult. The country, itself a corridor for desperate migrants hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, is divided into two factions. The western part of the country is overseen by a United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, while the east is controlled by a strongman. The State Department has a Level 4 travel advisory for Libya, warning Americans not to travel there because of ""crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict."" Libya has also gained infamy over its treatment of migrants seeking to reach Europe, with both advocates and U.S. officials finding that detainees in the North African country face brutal conditions, due process violations and even torture in immigration detention centers. It's unclear who exactly would be deported to Libya under the plans being considered by the Trump administration and whether they would be detained by authorities there upon arrival. As part of its aggressive efforts to deter migrants from entering or staying in the U.S. illegally, the Trump administration has mounted an intense diplomatic campaign to forge deportations agreements that allow the U.S. to send migrants to countries that are not their own. It has already persuaded several Latin America countries to accept third country nationals, sending Asian and African migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, as well as a group of Venezuelan men accused of gang membership to El Salvador, which transferred them to a notorious mega prison. But the Trump administration has also sought to broker deportation agreements with countries in other continents, including Africa and Europe. The other countries U.S. officials have approached for potential third country deportation arrangements include Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda, according to internal U.S. government documents and officials. It's unclear whether any of those countries will finalize agreements with the U.S. After CBS News identified Angola as one of the countries the U.S. had approached, its embassy in Washington said the West African country would not accept deportees from third countries.

5 charged after migrant boat capsized off San Diego coast,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-migrant-boat-human-smuggling/,5 charged after migrant boat capsizes off San Diego; Noem asks DOJ for death penalty,"Five Mexican nationals are facing charges after a small boat carrying more than a dozen people capsized off the coast of San Diego, killing three passengers, including a 14-year-old boy from India, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of California announced Tuesday. The boy's parents and two others were hospitalized following the human smuggling event, prosecutors confirmed in a news release. Nine other migrants were missing from the boat and were presumed dead, but authorities later located eight of them in Chula Vista, nearly 30 miles away from Del Mar, where the boat was found. A 10-year-old Indian girl, the boy's sister, remains missing, prosecutors said. ""The drowning deaths of these children are a heartbreaking reminder of how little human traffickers care about the costs of their deadly business,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said in a statement. U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday that there were originally 16 individuals on board, some of whom remain missing. Jesus Ivan Rodriguez-Leyva and Julio Cesar Zuniga-Luna were arrested on Monday at the beach where the overturned boat washed ashore, according to prosecutors. They were charged with Bringing in Aliens Resulting in Death and Bringing in Aliens for Financial Gain, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday night announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty. ""Their deaths were not only avoidable but were also the direct result of the greed and indifference of smugglers who exploited them,"" Noem said in a statement, in part. ""Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, alien smuggling acts that result in death are capital crimes punishable by death. And under the Federal Death Penalty Act, those who intentionally participate in conduct knowing that it could result in the loss of life may be eligible for capital punishment."" Prosecutors said three other suspects — Melissa Jennelle Cota, Gustavo Lara and Sergio Rojas-Fregoso — were arrested late Monday night after Border Patrol agents in Chula Vista identified a vehicle seen at a beach in Del Mar and investigated. While the driver of said vehicle fled, officers located two other vehicles involved and found the missing migrants, according to prosecutors. Cota, Lara and Rojas-Fregoso were charged with Transportation of Illegal Aliens. Prosecutors said Rojas-Fregoso had been previously deported on Dec. 19, 2023. It wasn't immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. It was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles north of the Mexico border, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told The Associated Press. He said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. In 2023, eight people were killed when two boats capsized off the San Diego coast.

Young boy gains perspective well beyond his years after tornado,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-boy-lost-home-oklahoma-tornado-gained-perspective/,"A young boy lost his home in a tornado. One year later, he's gained perspective well beyond his years.","Bartlesville, Oklahoma — A year after a tornado flattened his family's home, 9-year-old River Garrett isn't focused on what was lost — but on what can still be built. ""Rebuilding, it takes a while, it takes hard work. But to me, it's putting something back together where it is better than before,"" River said, outside his grandmother's brand new home in northern Oklahoma. On May 6, 2024, a powerful tornado tore across the area, killing two people and causing $25 million in damage. River's family survived, but their ranch was leveled. Tornado activity like what River lived through has significantly increased. In the first four months of 2025, there were 670 tornado reports and 35 deaths in the U.S. — more than a 43% jump in storms compared to the decade before, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. River's family is still sorting through the bits and pieces they were able to recover, but they consider themselves lucky. In Barnsdall, the next town over, Mayor Johnny Kelley said only 5% of his community has been rebuilt since the last time CBS News visited. But River, though just 8 at the time, seemed to understand the reality that others had it worse off than him. ""And I said to myself that I can't make this about me,"" River told CBS News back then. One year later, River has a new room and some old things that survived the tornado. He hopes to cover the walls with Michael Jackson pictures and records. ""I love my room, too. I was blown away when I saw my room, and I love it,"" River said. When asked how he's changed since the tornado, River said, ""I think I'm more aware of little things that can turn into big things. But I don't always worry about that."" ""I don't sweat unless it gets bigger over time, like the tornado did,"" he added. It's a reminder that even after unimaginable loss, a little perspective can help you heal.

Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-less-than-2-dozen-hostages-believed-to-be-alive-in-gaza/,Trump says fewer than 2 dozen hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza,"President Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. ""As of today, it's 21, three have died,"" Mr. Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting that until recently it was thought that 24 people were still alive. Speaking at the White House, he did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. ""There's 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,"" Mr. Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, has been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president's comments came as Israel approved plans on Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in what it says is a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel's operations there and have already drawn fierce international opposition.","Updated on: May 6, 2025 / 8:42 PM EDT / AP",N/A
Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trump-gavin-newsom-film-tariffs-tax-credit/,"Trump slams Newsom after California governor proposes federal film tax credit to ""Make America Film Again""","President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit. ""California built the film industry — and we're ready to bring even more jobs home. We've proven what strong state incentives can do,"" Newsom's post on X said. ""Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again."" His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was ""DYING a very fast death."" The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels. Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit from $330 million to $750 million. Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027. Mr. Trump said the American film industry has been ""decimated"" by other countries and the ""grossly incompetent"" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to ""abandon"" the U.S. But he vowed that ""we'll get it back."" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to ""make sure they're happy with"" the prospective tariffs. The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?"" Mr. Trump said. ""That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built."" Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage. ""And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,"" he said. He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California. ""I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,"" Mr. Trump said. ""If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,"" The president visited Los Angeles in late-January, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. ""I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. ""I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation."" Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor. ""I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,"" he said.

Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-u-s-bicycle-company-kent-international-halts-imports-from-china/,Tariffs force U.S. bicycle company to halt imports from China,"The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations. ""When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,"" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. ""And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees."" Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream. About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs. During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone. Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold. He says that makes him feel ""really bad"" and ""angry."" ""China is not paying these tariffs,"" Arnold said. ""We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted."" The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May. Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile. ""We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,"" Kramer said. ""And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair."" Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective. ""I can't even calculate that high,"" Kramer said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. ""I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example…I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.""

Top Trump officials will meet with China amid trade war,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-china-trade-war-meeting/,Top Trump officials will meet with China amid trade war,"Two Trump administration officials will meet with their Chinese counterparts to discuss trade in the coming days, the administration said Tuesday — a potentially key moment several weeks after the United States and China imposed steep tariffs on each other. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will ""meet with his counterpart from the People's Republic of China to discuss trade matters"" during a trip to Switzerland, his office said in a statement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will also travel to Switzerland this week, where he will meet with China's ""lead representative on economic matters."" The statement didn't identify who he would speak with, but Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in a post on X that Bessent will meet with Vice Premier He Lifeng. In a social media post Tuesday night, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. confirmed the Switzerland meeting, writing that China ""has decided to agree to engage with the #US side."" In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Bessent said he will meet with a Chinese team on Saturday and Sunday, and initial discussions will likely be about ""de-escalation, not about the big trade deal."" The Treasury secretary said the U.S. and China have ""shared interests"" because the sky-high tariffs imposed by both countries last month are not ""sustainable."" ""The world has been coming to the U.S., and China has been the missing piece,"" Bessent said on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle."" Hours before the U.S.-China meetings were announced, Bessent told lawmakers in a hearing that the U.S. had ""not engaged in negotiations"" with China yet. China and the United States have been locked in a tense tariff standoff in recent weeks, threatening to upend relations between the world's two largest economies and imperil more than a half-trillion dollars in annual trade between the two countries. President Trump hit China with 145% tariffs on many goods last month, part of a wider swath of steep ""reciprocal tariffs"" on dozens of U.S. trading partners that Mr. Trump has accused of unfair practices. China later retaliated with 125% tariffs on imports from the United States. And while Mr. Trump paused many of his reciprocal tariffs in the hope of striking new trade deals with other countries, he left the China tariffs in place. The escalating trade war has led to weeks of stock market turbulence, and sparked fears of slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Mr. Trump — who has cast his tariff strategy as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and cut trade deficits — has suggested at various points that he's open to striking deals with U.S. trading partners, though he said earlier Tuesday, ""We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us."" In an interview with NBC News last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials ""want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal."" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China ""at some point."" Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but pushed the Trump administration to drop its ""unilateral"" tariffs first. When asked about China's request to end tariffs before negotiations start, Bessent told Fox News he's ""not going to give away our strategy"" but ""everything's on the table.""
