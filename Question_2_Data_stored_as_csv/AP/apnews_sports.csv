Curry will have an MRI on Wednesday. His status is day to day, but coach Steve Kerr acknowledged it’s unlikely he’ll be available to play in Game 2 on Thursday. “He’s obviously crushed, but the guys picked him up and played a great game,” Kerr said. “Obviously we’re all concerned about Steph, but that’s part of the game. Guys get hurt, and you move on. Our guys did a great job of moving on and getting a great win 48 hours after a Game 7 road win. It’s an amazing group of guys. They compete. They’re together.” Curry started grabbing at the back of his left leg early in the second quarter shortly after hitting a 26-foot step-back 3-pointer. He powered through some discomfort for a bit, and after getting a 14-foot floater to fall for a 27-20 lead he started motioning to the bench that he needed to come out. Once a timeout by the Timberwolves finally stopped the clock, Curry jogged gingerly to the locker room with 13 points in 13 minutes on 5-for-9 shooting. “A little deflating, but we knew he did a great job of helping us build a comfortable lead,” teammate Draymond Green said. The 37-year-old Curry helped Golden State beat Houston in Game 7 of their first-round series two nights earlier. Going the distance after taking a 3-1 lead in that series cost Curry and the Warriors some valuable rest time, and there’s only one day off between games for the first five games. There are three off days between Game 5 on May 14 and Game 6 on May 18. After a five-year period during which he had a hard time staying healthy, with a variety of injuries to both hands and feet, Curry played in 70 games this season after logging 74 games last season. The four-time NBA champion and 11-time All-Star averaged 24 points per game against the Rockets for the sixth-seeded Warriors. The spirits were high for the Warriors in the aftermath of their all-hands-on-deck dismantling of the Wolves, despite the ominous departure of their most important player. “We have the best coaching staff in the NBA. We know they’ll put us in a good spot,” said Jimmy Butler, who finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. “We all want ‘30’ back. Until then, we can all hold down the fort.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",N/A
Haliburton’s 3 with 1.1 seconds left gives Pacers 120-119 stunning win over Cavs and 2-0 series lead,https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-pacers-cavaliers-haliburton-3ab13caac21987ef156ea8c2e8cb9dab,Haliburton’s 3 with 1.1 seconds left gives Pacers 120-119 stunning win over Cavs and 2-0 series lead,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Tyrese Haliburton said he knows he’s trusted to deliver in big moments. In three straight playoff games, the Indiana Pacers guard has delivered when it has mattered most. Haliburton made a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds remaining as the Pacers scored the final eight points in 47.9 seconds to stun the short-handed and top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers 120-119 on Tuesday night to take a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinals series. Haliburton scored 11 of his 19 points in the final 12 minutes. After Andrew Nembhard stole an inbounds pass by Cleveland’s Max Strus with 27.5 seconds remaining, Indiana tried to find a potential tying 3-pointer before Haliburton drove inside and got fouled. He made the first free throw, but missed the second. Haliburton got the offensive rebound and dribbled out to the 3-point line, where he made it from the top of the key. “I was (ticked) I missed the layup because I couldn’t hang onto the ball, so I backed it out. I just saw Ty Jerome, top of the key and knocked it down,” Haliburton said. “It’s the NBA, crazier things have happened. That’s just what basketball is. We don’t give up and we’re battle tested. We just find a way.” After making a layup with 1.3 seconds remaining in overtime to help the Pacers eliminate the Milwaukee Bucks, Haliburton has continued to hit key shots against the Cavaliers. He scored 22 points in Sunday’s 121-112 victory in the series opener, including a go-ahead 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter. “Obviously, we got lucky. Ty hit another amazing shot to win the game,” Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. “You don’t see this very often, let alone twice in one week. Tyrese, he came through again. We’re very fortunate.” Myles Turner and Aaron Nesmith led No. 4 seed Indiana with 23 points apiece. It’s the first time the Pacers have won the first two games of a playoff series on the road since a 1994 first-round set against Orlando. Game 3 is Friday night in Indianapolis. Donovan Mitchell scored 48 points for Cleveland, who were missing three key players, including two starters. NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley (left ankle) and key reserve De’Andre Hunter (right thumb) were injured in Game 1, while Darius Garland (left big toe) missed his fourth straight postseason game. “I feel like we outplayed them for the majority of the game and then towards the end we had our mental lapses. They capitalized on every single mistake that we made,” said Jarrett Allen, who had 22 points and 12 rebounds. Mitchell scored 15 points in the third quarter as the Cavaliers built a 98-81 lead late in the period. But the Pacers rallied with a 17-6 run to get back in it. Cleveland looked as though it got some breathing room with 1:06 remaining when Max Strus hit a 3-pointer off an assist by Mitchell to put them up 117-110. But the Cavs couldn’t hold on again as they committed two turnovers and the Pacers had a pair of offensive rebounds that led to points in the final minute. It’s the first time Cleveland dropped its first two at home in the playoffs since 1996 in the first round against the Knicks. “It’s hard to put all this in words,” Carlisle said. “Cleveland hit us with a hellacious punch early in the game. In the fourth, we just hung on. We maintained enough energy to get it done. Give the guys credit, they somehow found a way.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",N/A
Jaccob Slavin scores in OT as the Hurricanes beat the Capitals in Game 1 of their 2nd-round series,https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-capitals-score-nhl-playoffs-cf3a91e770ad093adec0deb215ab3476,Jaccob Slavin scores in OT as the Hurricanes beat the Capitals in Game 1 of their 2nd-round series,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Very few people in the arena knew the puck was in the net, including Jaccob Slavin, who shot it through traffic. Goaltender Logan Thompson figured it out when he saw the red light on behind him. “I didn’t know it went in until I saw Jordan Staal, Staalsy, coming with his arms up yelling at me,” Slavin said. Seeing it to believe it, Slavin’s overtime goal gave the Carolina Hurricanes a 2-1 victory at the Washington Capitals in Game 1 of their second-round series on Tuesday night. The winner came on their 94th attempt and 33rd that got on net, showing the shot volume offense that has gotten them to this point. “We were all over it, and we knew we had to just throw everything at the net,” Slavin said. “That mentality paid off there at the end.” Carolina allowed Washington to get just 14 shots on goal, the second-fewest in Hartford Whalers/Hurricanes history. Frederik Andersen gave up just an early second-period goal to Aliaksei Protas in his return from missing the end of the first round because of injury. “Just trying to take what comes my way and be in that moment all the time and just stay with it,” Andersen said. “You don’t know when that next big save’s going to happen.” Thompson made 31 of them for the Capitals, who spent large swaths of time defending in their own end. That sucked a lot of the energy out of the top seed in the Eastern Conference, which is accustomed to putting on the pressure rather than absorbing it. “We didn’t play our style of hockey,” Washington’s Dylan Strome said. “We let them dictate.” The Capitals led from Protas’ goal until nearly the midway point of the third, when an errant pass from Protas banked off teammate Alex Alexeyev’s right skate and to Jesperi Kotkaniemi, who fed Logan Stankoven to tie it. “I just thought I’d rip it,” Stankoven said. “It was nice to see it go in.” Carolina remains the only team perfect on the penalty kill this postseason, keeping Washington’s power play off the board twice to improve to 17 of 17. That, along with Kotkaniemi and Stankoven taking advantage of a mistake and Slavin scoring with Seth Jarvis screening Thompson was the difference. “We got some traffic,” coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “Obviously, it wasn’t the greatest of goals, but they all count.” Game 2 is Thursday night in Washington before the series shifts to Raleigh, North Carolina, for 3 and 4. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",N/A
Oilers rally for NHL-record fifth straight time to beat Golden Knights 4-2 in Game 1,https://apnews.com/article/oilers-golden-knights-score-nhl-playoffs-9741061ec6e71f1be1574c1b1b26d1d4,Oilers rally for NHL-record fifth straight time to beat Golden Knights 4-2 in Game 1,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — One thing is becoming clear during this year’s NHL playoffs: Don’t count out the Edmonton Oilers. They rallied from a 2-0 series deficit to oust Los Angeles in six games in the first round. Then they opened the second round Tuesday night by setting a league record with their fifth consecutive playoff comeback victory in a single postseason. Zach Hyman scored from just above the right circle with 3:02 left to put Edmonton ahead for good in its 4-2 victory over Vegas Golden Knights after falling behind 2-0. “That’s part of having a mature, older group,” Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. “Players have seen a lot, a lot of good things and a lot of bad things. In the playoffs, things fluctuate. There’s a lot of things that can stress out the team. No matter what happens, I think we handled it really well tonight.” Vegas, which had just seven shots on goal over the final two periods, lost a playoff game in regulation after leading by at least two goals for the first time. The Golden Knights are 47-4 overall in the postseason with that kind of lead. Game 2 is Thursday night in Las Vegas. “We’ll go over it and get ready for Thursday night’s game,” said Mark Stone, who scored both Vegas goals. “It’s going to be a big one for us.” Leon Draisaitl had a goal and an assist for the Oilers, and Corey Perry and Connor Brown scored the other goals. Evan Bouchard and Connor McDavid each had two assists. McDavid now has four consecutive postseasons with at least 10 assists for fourth-best in league history. Calvin Pickard was barely tested after the first period and finished with 15 shots. “We have experience to win games in a lot of different ways, a lot of untraditional ways,” Hyman said. “Any time you get a win, it’s a big day. We’ve got to take what we did in the second and third and do in the first.” Stone tied Jonathan Marchessault’s franchise record with 36 goals for his Vegas career. He also extended his goal-scoring streak to three games. Adin Hill made 24 saves. Both star-studded top lines delivered in the first period, with Stone scoring twice, the first on a double-minor power play. Edmonton’s top unit cut the deficit in half with 3:34 left when Perry deked Hill for an open net with McDavid and Draisaitl getting assists on the play. Neither team scored in the second period even though the Oilers outshot Vegas 12-1. The Golden Knights had never been held to fewer than two shots on goal in a regulation playoff period. Edmonton didn’t waste a chance early in the third, tying the score 57 seconds in when Draisaitl backhanded a shot off the boards and off Hill. Hyman, who earlier in the shift took a stick to the face from Kaedan Korczak, broke the tie in the closing minutes, and Brown sealed the win 1:16 later. Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo did not play because of an illness, allowing Korczak to make his first career postseason start. Vegas also was without Pavel Dorofeyev, who led the team with 35 goals this season, for the second game in a row because of an undisclosed injury. Coach Bruce Cassidy has descibed him as day to day. ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",N/A
"Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty won’t run in the Preakness, dashing Triple Crown possibility",https://apnews.com/article/sovereignty-preakness-triple-crown-e2368353711c0671ed019989a763b461,"Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty won’t run in the Preakness, dashing Triple Crown possibility","Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty will not run in the Preakness Stakes, officials announced Tuesday, meaning there won’t be a Triple Crown champion for a seventh consecutive year. “We received a call today from trainer Bill Mott that Sovereignty will not be competing in the Preakness,” said Mike Rogers, executive VP of 1/ST Racing, which operates the Preakness. “We extend our congratulations to the connections of Sovereignty and respect their decision.” Mott told Preakness officials the plan will be to enter Sovereignty in the Belmont Stakes, the third jewel of the Triple Crown, on June 7 at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York. Mott on Sunday morning had foreshadowed skipping the Preakness in the name of long-term interests. “We want to do what’s best for the horse,” he told reporters at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. “Of course, you always think about a Triple Crown, and that’s not something we’re not going to think about.” Sovereignty won a muddy Derby with jockey Junior Alvarado at odds of 7-1 by passing favorite Journalism down the stretch. Owner Godolphin’s U.S. director of bloodstock, Michael Banahan, deferred an explanation to Mott in a text message sent to The Associated Press, calling it a team decision that “both feel it’s the right direction for the horse going forward.” A message left for Mott was not immediately returned. This is the fifth time since Justify won all three races in 2018 that the Preakness will go on without a true shot at a Triple Crown. Elevated winner Country House and Maximum Security, who was disqualified for interference, each did not participate in 2019, the races were run out of order in 2020, Bob Baffert-trained Medina Spirit was DQ’d for a positive drug test in 2021 and long shot Rich Strike was held out in 2022 to rest him for the previously planned five weeks. Mage finished third in the Preakness in 2023, and Mystik Dan was second last year after his owner and trainer also were initially reluctant to run him. The two-week turnaround from the Kentucky Derby to the Preakness and changes in modern racing have sparked debate around the sport about spacing out the races. Prominent owner Mike Repole earlier Tuesday posted on social media a proposal to move the Belmont to second in the Triple Crown order, four weeks after the Kentucky Derby and sliding the Preakness back further with the aim of keeping more of the top horses involved. “The Preakness being run two weeks after the Kentucky Derby, in this new day and age in racing, shows the lack of vision and leadership needed to evolve this sport,” Repole wrote. “I expect the top three finishers of this year’s Derby to skip the Preakness and go right to the Belmont.” No decision has been made on second-place finisher Journalism, who was the Derby favorite, or third-place Baeza for the 150th running of the Preakness, the last at Pimlico Race Course before it is knocked down and rebuilt. The plan is for the 2026 Preakness to take place at Laurel Park between Baltimore and Washington while Pimlico is under construction. ___ AP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing",N/A

Home-court advantage? It doesn’t exist so far in the NBA conference semifinals — where visiting teams combined to go 4-0 in Game 1s, the first time that has happened during this round in the league’s playoff history. Indiana beat top-seeded Cleveland on Sunday in the opener of that East series, New York beat defending champion Boston and Denver beat West top-seeded Oklahoma City in their respective openers Monday, and Golden State topped Minnesota in Game 1 of their matchup Tuesday. “It’s an amazing group of guys,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Golden State’s win, one that came with Stephen Curry out for much of the game with a strained hamstring. So far in these playoffs, road teams have gone 23-25. That’s on pace to be the third-best overall road playoff record in NBA postseason history, not counting the bubble season of 2020 when nobody technically was at home. Road teams had gone 3-1 in the Round 2 openers of the NBA playoffs on three other occasions — 2023, 2015 and 2011 — in the current playoff format, which dates to 1984. (It also happened inside the bubble during the 2020 playoffs, when teams had home and road designations, but games were on neutral floors inside Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.) But 4-0 has never happened, until now. “I always say a playoff series doesn’t start until someone wins a road game,” Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton said. “Well, we’ve won two.” That’s true: Indiana doubled down on its road success by also taking Game 2 at Cleveland on Tuesday night, just before Golden State lost Stephen Curry early but won Game 1 at Minnesota. And all that led to even more road history: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday became the first three-day stretch in NBA playoff history where visiting teams combined to go at least 6-0. That run started Sunday with Indiana’s Game 1 win at Cleveland, then Golden State’s Game 7 road win at Houston in the conclusion of the first round of the playoffs. The wins by New York and Denver were Monday, then Indiana and Golden State won again on Tuesday. “This team has fought all year,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “It’s been a pretty good road team.” They’re not alone. Not this year, anyway, and this trend didn’t start in these playoffs. Home teams won 54% of games in the regular season, the fourth time the leaguewide home winning percentage has dipped that low in the last five years. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",N/A
"NBA playoffs are seeing close games become the norm. And there have been some heroic moments, too",https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-last-second-winners-e18742ea59aa43ff4da71b2478006e95,"NBA playoffs are seeing close games become the norm. And there have been some heroic moments, too","Aaron Gordon went to the postgame interview room after his latest heroic moment for the Denver Nuggets, took a seat with his two nephews on his lap and waited for somebody to say something. He finally broke the silence. “Any questions?” he asked. Seems about right that he would ask that, given that so far in these NBA playoffs Gordon has been one of the players with all the answers in the biggest moments — when games are on the line. He is one of the contenders for the unofficial title of Mr. Game Winner of these playoffs, his case built around a no-time-left dunk — believed to be the first of its kind in postseason history — to beat the Los Angeles Clippers in Round 1, then a 3-pointer with 2.8 seconds left to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night. “Did I know it was in? I knew it wasn’t a miss,” Gordon said of his latest game winner. And Gordon isn’t alone in being part of these down-to-the-wire moments. Tyrese Haliburton — another Mr. Game Winner candidate — now has two such shots as well in these playoffs, the latest coming in the form of a 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to beat top-seeded Cleveland 120-119 on Tuesday night for a 2-0 Pacers lead in that series. That one came after he had a layup with 1.4 seconds left in overtime of the Pacers’ series-clinching, frantic Game 5 rally in the final moments to oust Milwaukee. “Obviously, had to get lucky,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said Tuesday night after Haliburton’s latest heroics led his team’s second successful comeback from seven points down and less than a minute left in a three-game span. “Tyrese hit another amazing shot to win the game. You don’t see this very often, let alone twice in one week. We’re very fortunate.” He’s right. You don’t see this very often. There are five players — Robert Horry in 2002, LeBron James in 2006 and 2018, Jamal Murray last year, and now Gordon and Haliburton this year — who have hit two go-ahead shots in the final 10 seconds of wins in the same postseason. That’s it. That’s the whole list. “This is what I do,” Haliburton said in the on-court interview afterward, still out of breath. Round 2 is just getting underway in these NBA playoffs and already there have been 15 games decided by three points or fewer, matching or exceeding the total from each of the last 10 playoff years. The New York Knicks have won five games so far in the playoffs, four of them by three points or fewer. “We’re just going to keep fighting,” the Knicks’ Mikal Bridges said after the Game 1 win at Boston on Monday night. “That’s who we are ... and we keep showing it.” This is not normal: So far, 30% of games in this year’s playoffs going into Tuesday have been decided by three points or fewer. It’s happening about twice as often as it did last season and about three times as often as it did in other postseason runs over the last decade. Of those 15 games so far decided by three points or fewer, five of them have had a go-ahead basket in the final 10 seconds. There’s the two by Haliburton, the two by Gordon, and the other was New York’s Jalen Brunson hitting a 3-pointer to beat Detroit in Round 1. Brunson was the NBA’s top clutch player this season. Haliburton is an Olympic champion. Gordon was part of Denver’s run to the NBA title two years ago. In the biggest moments, they know what is required. “It’s not about putting the team on my back,” Brunson said. “I have confidence in them. They have confidence in me. We’re going to compete. We’re going to find the best way to attack each possession. It may look like I get the credit ... but it’s not just me.” Brunson had a chance to win Game 1 at Boston with a last-second floater in regulation — “not clutch enough,” he mused when asked about it after the Knicks finished off the overtime win — but the Knicks found a way anyway. New York was down by 20 in that game and won; Boston was 40-1 this season in games when it had a lead of 20 or more. Denver was down by 14 at Oklahoma City and won; the Thunder are 64-2 this season in games in which they led by at least 12 points against anybody besides the Nuggets, but they’re only 2-3 in such games against Denver. The Nuggets now have three wins by three points or fewer so far in these playoffs. “We make stupid mistakes,” Denver star Nikola Jokic, who had a historic 42-point, 22-rebound effort, told Altitude TV after the Game 1 win. “But we find a way.” At this time of year, finding a way is the only thing that’s required. Haliburton, Gordon and Brunson have proven that. ___ On Basketball analyzes the biggest topics in the NBA. More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",N/A
"Sliding mitts are baseball’s ‘must-have,’ even if at youth levels, they’re all fashion, no function",https://apnews.com/article/sliding-mitts-little-league-566b12315127f05ac75571e8a5d4d062,"Sliding mitts are baseball’s ‘must-have,’ even if at youth levels, they’re all fashion, no function","PITTSBURGH (AP) — Andrew McCutchen hasn’t had the conversation with 7-year-old son Steel yet, but the Pittsburgh Pirates star knows it’s probably coming at some point. Steel, already playing in a youth baseball league, will probably come home at one point and ask his five-time All-Star father if he can have whatever hot item his teammates might be wearing during a given spring. McCutchen plans to accommodate Steel up to a point. The oldest of McCutchen’s four children is already rocking an arm sleeve, just the way dad does. Yet if Steel is hoping his father will spring for a sliding mitt — a padded glove a player can slip over one of their hands to protect it should the hand get stepped on while diving headfirst for a base — he probably shouldn’t get his hopes up. McCutchen, who has stolen 220 bases at the major league level, has never worn one. And he’s quick to point out the next time the cleat of a fielder mashes his hand will also be the first. Still, the 38-year-old understands. Once upon a time, he was a 20-something who epitomized baseball cool, from his dreadlocks (long since shorn) to his goatee to his rope chain to the occasional skull cap he wore underneath his batting helmet, all of it designed to accentuate McCutchen’s innate blend of talent and charisma. “It’s all about the drip,” McCutchen said with a smile. Even if the “drip” (Gen Z slang for stylish clothes and their accessories) emphasizes fashion over function, particularly when it comes to the gloves — which look a bit like oven mitts — that are becoming just as ubiquitous in the Little Leagues as they are in the major leagues. Former major leaguer Scott Podsednik (career stolen base total: 309) is credited with “inventing” the sliding mitt during the late stages of his 11-year career. Tired of having his hand stepped on, Podsednik worked with a hand therapist for a solution. The initial mitts were relatively simple. A 2009 picture of Podsednik sliding into second base shows his left hand covered in what looks like a padded modified batting glove, all wrapped in black to match the trim on his Chicago White Sox uniform. Chicago White Sox’s Scott Podsednik steals second base during a baseball game against the Cleveland Indians, June 29, 2009, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Mark Duncan, File) Things have gotten considerably more intricate over the years. Google “sliding mitt designs” and you’ll find themes ranging from the American flag to an ice cream cone to aliens to a poop emoji ( yes, really ). Scott McMillen, a lawyer in the Chicago area, had no plans to get into the baseball accessory business. He first took notice of sliding mitts when his son Braydon, then 10, pointed out one of his teammates had one and said basically, “Oh hey dad, wouldn’t it be nice if I had one, too.” They headed to a local sporting goods store, where McMillen was surprised at the variety available. That was around 2021. By early 2024, McMillen had launched “ Goat’d,” a specialty baseball accessory company with everything from sliding mitts to batting gloves to arm sleeves to headbands and more, many of them religiously inspired. Sales during their first full year? Over 1 million units. “We were surprised at how large the marketplace is,” McMillen said. Maybe he shouldn’t have been. Youth sports have bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Aspen Institute’s 2024 State of Play report noted that the participation levels in sports among children ages 6-17 were the highest they’ve been since 2015. Baseball’s numbers have steadied following a decline. Little League International told The Associated Press last fall that more than 2 million kids played baseball or softball under its umbrella across the world, an uptick over 2019. Many of those kids are also fans of the game, some of whom may have noticed their favorite major leaguer sporting a mitt when they’re on the bases. Yes, that was San Diego Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. sliding across home plate ( feetfirst, by the way ) with a bright yellow mitt on his left hand in the ninth inning of a 2-1 win over Pittsburgh last weekend. It’s one of the many ways in which the game has evolved over the years. When McMillen grew up, there wasn’t much swag to go around. “We had our baseball uniform and our glove (and) everyone looked the same, everyone was the same,” he said. “Now, everyone wants to express themselves individually. The best way to do that without acting like a clown is to wear something that shows people who you are.” Self-expression, however, doesn’t exactly come cheap, particularly in an era when top-of-the-line bats are $400 or more. What amounts to an entry-level sliding mitt can go for $40, but Goat’d and others have versions that can fetch double that. That hasn’t stopped sales from being brisk, and McMillen points out it’s not merely a luxury item. “We don’t play football with 1940s safety equipment,” he said. “You feel better in the (batter’s) box when you have something that protects you, right? With a sliding mitt, it’s also like, ‘Hey this is fun. It’s cool. I want to be like my fave high school player, like my favorite college player.’” It’s becoming increasingly common for McMillen and other members of the company’s staff to spot Goat’d gear at the field. In recent months, they’ve popped up in youth tournaments from Georgia to Las Vegas, sometimes in the back pockets of players as young as 6 or 7. McMillen can’t help but shake his head to see his product become part of the time-honored tradition of kids imitating their heroes. Which is good for business and, oh by the way, probably unnecessary. Here’s the thing: In most — if not all — youth baseball leagues, headfirst slides that would require a player to stretch out their hand to secure the bag are illegal. In Little League, for example, stealing bases for players 12 and under is rare because the player can take off only after the ball has reached the batter. And even if they do bolt for the next base, they have to slide feetfirst. The only times in Little League that a baserunner can dive headfirst toward a base is when they are returning to it while in a rundown or during a pickoff attempt, both of which are also rare. That doesn’t stop the players from wanting a sliding mitt. It also doesn’t stop their parents from buying them, all part of the pressure to “keep up with the Jones” that has practically been a part of youth sports culture since the first time somebody came to practice with a batting glove or wristbands. It’s a phenomenon Chelsea Cahill and her family has known for years. The longtime educator who lives just east of Columbus, Ohio, has spent most of the last decade shuttling her three boys from practice to games to tournaments. What she and her husband have learned over the years is that some trends come and go, but the pressure to have the right stuff remains. “There’s always that feeling of ‘This is the next new thing’ or ‘This is what you’ve got to get,’” Cahill said. They appeased their sons up to a point, but only up to a point. Last summer their youngest son Braxton, then 11, and the rest of the kids on his travel team kept pestering their parents to buy sliding mitts. Entering the final tournament, the team moms decided to give in. Sort of. Rather than plop down that kind of money for something they didn’t actually need, the moms headed to a local dollar store and bought them actual oven mitts — the kind used to pull tonight’s dinner from out of the oven. Average retail price? Less than a cup of coffee at the gas station. Oh, and the kids loved them, and wore them during the game. Cahill posted video of them playing with the mitts stuck in their back pocket to her TikTok account. The video is now at 12 million views and counting. “They thought it was hilarious, but we didn’t really think they would wear them for the rest of the tournament,” Cahill said. “We were wrong. They really embraced it!” Among viewers of that TikTok, by the way, were the people at Goat’d, who sent Braxton a couple of mitts as a result. The good news is, Cahill now won’t have to buy one for Braxton this spring. Yet there’s also something else she has learned through the years: This time in her boys’ lives is fleeting. For proof, just look at her calendar. Her two older sons — the ones who played travel baseball just like Braxton, and asked for all the cool stuff their teammates had, just like Braxton has — gave up baseball by the time they got to high school. Her advice to parents who might be feeling the financial pinch of what it takes to play these days: Relax. “We’ve learned as parents is to stop taking it so seriously,” she said. “They’re kids. Let them have fun.” A day after hundreds of members of the Monroeville Baseball and Softball Association marched through the Pittsburgh suburb’s well-appointed community park, the regular season is in full swing. All four fields are alive with the chatter of coaches, parents and boys and girls aged anywhere from 5-12. Over on Field 1, the Rays are in the middle of their season opener. Playing first base, Josiah Jones has his glove at the ready, with a black sliding mitt noticeably sticking out of his left back pocket. Per the league rules, the Rays and the other players at the “Bronco” level (ages 11-12), play actual full-on baseball. They can take leads and steal bases whenever they like, though headfirst slides are only allowed when returning to a base, just like in Little League. Longtime MBSA executive commissioner Josh Plassmeyer is milling about, trying to keep tabs on everything. Plassmeyer outlawed sliding mitts on his son Grant’s 10-and-under tournament team, calling them a “distraction” because players would spend so much time fiddling with them once they got to first base, they would miss signs from the third-base coach. About 50 feet away, Jones settles into the box and rips a ball to left-center field. His long legs carry him past first base, and he cruises into second with an easy double. As his teammates erupted in the dugout, Jones beamed for a brief moment. Then, as the opposing pitcher stepped onto the rubber, he took an aggressive lead off second and eyed third. His back pocket, the one where his sliding mitt had been 30 minutes before, was empty. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",N/A

Mayor Muriel Bowser drew a laugh from the room when she was asked how it feels to manage a mercurial relationship with the White House and Congress — while, by the way, also trying to run a city of 700,000 people. “It is just like you might imagine,” she deadpanned. “It’s tricky.” A few hours after that comment Monday, Bowser’s balancing act with President Donald Trump was on public display. She appeared with Trump to celebrate Washington being named as host for the 2027 NFL draft and maintained a poker face while Trump talked at length about immigration. Bowser also continues to lobby the House of Representatives to pass a simple fix that would prevent the nation’s capital from having to immediately cut $400 million from its 2025 budget in the middle of the budget year. The House essentially created the shortfall earlier this year when it eliminated a little-known provision in a budget resolution. The change would force the District of Columbia to immediately revert to its 2024 budget parameters. And while the Senate immediately passed a simple fix, the House has failed to bring that measure up for a vote during four weeks in session — despite it being publicly endorsed by Trump. Bowser has warned that layoffs, furloughs and service cuts could be coming — and within days — if the issue isn’t resolved. Now Bowser’s relationship with the D.C. Council is coming under public stress. The third-term mayor faces a looming showdown with the council over a host of budget issues and her new deal to bring the NFL’s Washington Commanders back to the nation’s capital. Citing the uncertainty surrounding the 2025 budget, Bowser has delayed submitting a proposed 2026 budget to the council by more than a month. But D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has publicly complained that Bowser is dragging out the process. “We can’t wait longer to start making the service reductions and cuts,” Mendelson said Monday of the 2025 budget cuts. “She has to move forward now.” Bowser maintains she is following the proper timeline and protocol required by the city’s chief financial officer. But Mendelson contends that Bowser was using the delay to “jam the council” and force it into a pressurized deadline where city legislators wouldn’t have time to properly question either the budget or the particulars of the Commanders agreement. That stadium deal should prompt a robust debate when it comes up for D.C. Council approval. When it was first announced, Mendelson said he didn’t think it had enough votes to pass. But different members of the 12-person body have staked out widely varied initial positions. First-term Ward 5 Councilmember Zachary Parker called the chance to bring football back to the nation’s capital and revitalize the site of the old RFK Stadium “a once in a generation opportunity.” Parker said he believed the deal would and should pass; he simply wants to make sure the city gets the best deal possible. But veteran Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen has taken a harder public line. He says he opposes the entire concept of a stadium — especially if any significant amount of public money is spent on the project. “I don’t think a stadium returns back the economic investment. Every study under the sun shows that,” Allen said last week at a public meeting to rally opposition to the stadium deal. “You can love football and love the Commanders and still think this is a bad deal for the city.”",N/A
The stars are still aligned in golf as the PGA Championship nears,https://apnews.com/article/scheffler-dechambeau-mcilroy-spieth-pga-championship-118eb4085a99cac2a927b8e938aab7a0,The stars are still aligned in golf as the PGA Championship nears,"A different month, a different major and the stars are still aligned. Bryson DeChambeau finally cashed in on a Sunday, losing a five-shot lead before pulling ahead on the final three holes to win in South Korea. This was three weeks after Rory McIlroy picked up a Masters green jacket and the career Grand Slam. It was about 13 hours before Scottie Scheffler destroyed the field in Dallas. And as somewhat of a footnote, Jordan Spieth shot a 62 on the final day in Dallas that only stoked conversation about the chances of another career Grand Slam. The PGA Championship starts in nine days. “Scottie is on a great run. Joaquin Niemann is on a great run. Jon Rahm has been playing well,” DeChambeau said after his victory at LIV Golf Korea. “There’s a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that’s going to be in the PGA Championship. We’re going to be battling it out.” Most peculiar was how DeChambeau included Niemann — three wins in LIV Golf this year, but still without a top-10 finish in his 23 starts in the majors — and left out McIlroy, whose three wins this year have come at Pebble Beach, The Players Championship and the Masters. DeChambeau played with McIlroy in the final round at Augusta National, where he took the lead after two holes before fading to a 75 to finish four shots behind. He later said when asked about the dynamic in their pairing that McIlroy “wouldn’t talk to me.” Rahm has yet to finish out of the top 10 at LIV Golf, but he has gone quiet in the majors since joining the Saudi-funded league. He’s still Jon Rahm, however. It all sets up for high intrigue going into the second major of the year. That hasn’t always been the case for the PGA Championship whether it was held in May or August. The Masters is forever linked with Augusta National and decades of high drama. The U.S. Open bills itself as the toughest test in golf, sometimes to a fault. The British Open is played on a links course. And how is the PGA Championship best defined? “The other one,” Geoff Ogilvy once said. The Masters, of course, will be hard to top the way it played out. McIlroy, with his best chance at the career slam, fell behind, built a big lead, shockingly lost his big lead, rallied with two magnificent shots and eventually won a playoff over Justin Rose. McIlroy is still buzzing over finally winning the green jacket, which he wore during appearances last week on NBC’s “Today” and “The Tonight Show,” the latter with host Jimmy Fallon in which McIlroy replicated chipping into a washing machine from when he was a wee lad in Northern Ireland. The career Grand Slam is in the books. Is the calendar Grand Slam in play? Only four players since the modern slam came to life in 1960 — Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Spieth — have even won the first two legs. The PGA Championship is at Quail Hollow, where McIlroy already has won four times. But he is no longer the betting favorite one week out. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler as a slight favorite after a brand of golf from the No. 1 player not seen since last year. Scheffler missed two months recovering from minor surgery after he punctured his right hand while making ravioli. Something had been missing in his game since his return. But it was all there in Dallas, and it was frightening for those who had to face it. Scheffler was poised to break the PGA Tour scoring record of 72 holes until a chip rolled back to his feet on the 17th (bogey) and he failed to birdie the 18th (his first time all week not making birdie or better on a par 5). He still tied the mark at 253 and won by eight. “I feel like my game is trending in a good direction,” Scheffler said. “I’m excited to start the rest of the season.” It’s May and he’s talking about a starting point. Three majors are still to come, and the PGA Championship could be a great indicator where this is headed. BetMGM Sportsbook has Scheffler at +400, with McIlroy at +500. That could change after this week because McIlroy is playing at Philadelphia Cricket Club and Scheffler is not. DeChambeau was listed at +1200 and always worth noticing. He had a burden lifted in South Korea, not just because it was his first win since the U.S. Open last year, but because it was his fourth straight time in the final group (in LIV Golf with its shotgun start, that means starting on the first hole). His scoring average the previous three times was 73.7. And then he shot 30 on the back nine in South Korea and won by two. Next stop: the PGA Championship, where last year in Kentucky DeChambeau was every bit the entertainer and lost to Xander Schauffele’s birdie putt on the final hole. As for Spieth, he’s still hard to predict as he returns from wrist surgery last August. But a 62 in the final round suggests his game isn’t too far off. The only scars from Dallas might be spending the first two days with Scheffler. Spieth opened with rounds of 67-69 and was 12 shots behind. “It wasn’t that long ago I was definitely better than him, and now I’m definitely not right now,” Spieth said. “I hate admitting that about anybody, but I just watched it those first two rounds, and I’ve got to get better. It’s very inspiring.” Gary Player (1965) and Nicklaus (1966) completed the career Grand Slam one year apart. Is it possible for that to happen one month apart? As is often said about the Masters, the PGA Championship can’t start soon enough. ___ On The Fringe analyzes the biggest topics in golf during the season.

Mitchell and shorthanded Cavaliers don’t have enough at the end and go down 2-0 in series to Pacers,https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-cavaliers-pacers-f7f0f008ad0680a8ca055ab399a54deb,Mitchell and shorthanded Cavaliers don’t have enough at the end and go down 2-0 in series to Pacers,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell did everything he physically could to try to get the Cleveland Cavaliers back on equal footing in their Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Indiana Pacers. It wasn’t enough, though. Now, the Cavaliers face their most daunting task of the season — down two games, having to go on the road and being shorthanded. “We’ve got to go get two in Indy. Simple as that,” Mitchell said after scoring 48 points in Cleveland’s 120-119 loss to Indiana on Tuesday night. The top-seeded Cavaliers entered the game without three key players, including two starters. NBA Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley (left ankle) was injured in Game 1, while Darius Garland (left big toe) missed his fourth straight postseason game. De’Andre Hunter (right thumb) was also injured Sunday night. TNT reported during the game that Mitchell was also hampered by a calf strain, but that was not listed on the NBA’s injury report. He also started cramping late in the game as Indiana rallied from a 119-112 deficit with eight straight points in the final 47.9 seconds. “I’m banged up, we all are. It’s tough, but that’s what the playoffs are,” said Mitchell, who had the second-most points in a playoff game at Cleveland’s Rocket Arena. Mitchell played 36 minutes, went 15 of 30 from the field and tied a playoff career high with 17 made free throws. He also had nine assists that resulted in 24 Cleveland points. Six of the assists came on 3-pointers, including one to Max Strus to give the Cavs a 117-110 advantage with 1:06 remaining. Cleveland did not have enough at the end. Mitchell committed an offensive foul with 45.9 seconds remaining, leading to Pascal Siakam’s layup to bring them within 119-116. Mitchell then couldn’t get a rebound after Tyrese Haliburton missed a free throw with the Cavs leading by two. Haliburton got the loose ball and hit a step-back 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to give the Pacers the victory. “I should have grabbed the ball. I was right there. That’s on me,” Mitchell said. “On the charge call, I tried to be strong with the ball. I knew they were going to trap. I understood it was coming, but the elbow was too high.” Cleveland led most of the game despite going with a shorter rotation of nine players. Defensively, they did a better job of dealing with Indiana’s quick pace until the end. “I thought we outplayed them, that’s the shame of this game,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “We had some poor decision-making plays at the rim, turnovers. A couple bad decisions, I felt like. So that was part of the collapse.” The Cavaliers are hoping to possibly get Mobley, Garland or Hunter back for Game 3 in Indiana on Friday night. If not, Mitchell has faith his shorthanded group can find a way to make it a series. Cleveland has rallied from a 2-0 series deficit three times previously — the 2007 Eastern Conference finals against Detroit, the 2016 NBA Finals against Golden State and 2018 Eastern Conference finals against Boston. “We’ve shown how deep we are as a team, how great we are as a unit. It’s tough losing like that, but we got to find a way,” Mitchell said. “We can sit here and dwell on this and be home in about four or five days, or we can move on and take some things that we did really well and go from there. “We’ve got to go out there and take care of business. Otherwise, that’s it.” Jarrett Allen — who had 22 points and 12 rebounds — said Mitchell’s performance made him realize he has to try harder as well. “You can’t let one guy, especially your leader, go into something alone like that and give it his all,” Allen said. “It pushes everybody on the bench to try their hardest and try to replicate that.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",N/A
Warriors take Game 1 from cold-shooting Wolves 99-88 despite Curry’s departure with hamstring strain,https://apnews.com/article/nba-playoffs-warriors-timberwolves-score-bb7b767b70afb93617db7d4894a4800e,Warriors take Game 1 from cold-shooting Wolves 99-88 despite Curry’s departure with hamstring strain,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Stephen Curry was already in the locker room with a bag of ice against his leg when his Golden State teammates arrived for halftime with a comfortable lead. The Warriors sure made the best of a bad situation. Buddy Hield and Draymond Green delivered from 3-point range with Curry suddenly sidelined by a hamstring strain, and Jimmy Butler gave the Warriors a vintage all-around performance in an inspired 99-88 victory over the stumbling Timberwolves that opened the second-round series on Tuesday night. “It was beautiful to see,” Green said. “Everybody who came into the game gave us something.” Hield picked up where he left off in the Game 7 win at Houston that finished the first round by scoring 24 points on 5-for-8 shooting from 3-point range. Butler had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and Green had four first-half 3s on his way to 18 points, as the Warriors used 12 players, plenty of hustle and lockdown defense to overcome the concerning departure of the franchise cornerstone Curry. “It’s about the intensity and the heart and the fight, and if you do that, you give yourself a chance,” coach Steve Kerr said. The home teams have yet to win in the second round of these NBA playoffs. Minnesota has another chance to get one in Game 2 on Thursday. The big question: Will Curry will be available? The league’s career-leading 3-point shooter and four-time NBA champion exited early in the second quarter after hitting a 14-footer and grabbing the back of his left leg. The Warriors ruled him out for the remainder of the game soon after that. Kerr frequently sent a zone defense at a Wolves team that went 7 for 47 from 3-point range in a convincing win over the Los Angeles Lakers in the Game 5 clincher in the first round, and the bricks piled up even higher after nearly a week off. “People are going to try to blame whatever, blame whoever,” said star Anthony Edwards, who had one point in the first half. “They can blame me. I just didn’t play good enough.” The Wolves missed their first 16 shots from 3-point range until they were down by 20 and Naz Reid drained one from the wing with 8:32 left in the third quarter. Edwards had 23 points and 14 rebounds after the rough start, finishing 9 for 22 from the floor. Reid had 19 points and Julius Randle added 16 points for the Wolves, who finished 5 for 29 from behind the arc and trailed by 23 points late in the third. “We had opportunities to run out. Our transition decision making was diabolical,” coach Chris Finch said. “Obviously we couldn’t hit a shot, but I didn’t like the fact that we couldn’t repeatedly generate good shots. We should’ve been able to.” Butler, Green and the Warriors had a big hand in that. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",N/A
"Rookie GM Brian Gregory says he’s ready to rebuild the Suns, touts closeness with owner Mat Ishbia",https://apnews.com/article/suns-brian-gregory-mat-ishbia-d2c50b6f4b64910344e9099a98cd4915,"Rookie GM Brian Gregory says he’s ready to rebuild the Suns, touts closeness with owner Mat Ishbia","PHOENIX (AP) — Brian Gregory’s basketball resume has plenty of gravitas thanks to nearly two decades as an NCAA Division I head coach at Dayton, Georgia Tech and South Florida. That’s not why he’s the new general manager of the Phoenix Suns. Instead, it is Gregory’s 25-year relationship with Suns owner Mat Ishbia that is the major reason he’s making the rare transition from college sidelines to an NBA front office. Some may see that as a negative, but Gregory believes his closeness with Ishbia will be an asset as the Suns embark on a difficult rebuild following one of the most disappointing seasons in franchise history. “I’m never going to shy away from the fact that one of the reasons I’m sitting up here is because of my relationship with Mat Ishbia,” Gregory said Tuesday. “But that relationship is founded on our alignment. Shared values. Shared work ethic. We’ve been through a lot together. “He trusts me and I trust him.” The 58-year-old Gregory was elevated to the general manager’s role with the Suns last week, with former GM James Jones moving into the role of a senior advisor. Oronde Taliaferro was promoted to assistant general manager and Paul Rivers will add basketball operations responsibilities to his role as chief innovation officer. Gregory was an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1999 to 2003, which was the same time that Ishbia was a walk-on guard for the Spartans. Michigan State enjoyed plenty of success during those years, including a national championship in 2000. Now the Ishbia-Gregory pairing will try to recreate that magic for a franchise that has never won a title in its 57-year history despite making the Finals in 1976, 1993 and 2021. The Suns finished last season with a disappointing 36-46 record despite the league’s most expensive roster that included the All-Star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. Booker — a four-time All-Star and franchise icon who has spent all of his 10 seasons in the desert — is the only player who seems certain to return. Gregory’s first task this offseason will be hiring a new head coach to replace Mike Budenholzer, who was fired after just one season. It will be the Suns’ fourth head coach in four years. After that, it will be time to focus on an expensive but flawed roster. Ishbia said last month he wants future Suns teams to feature “some grit, some determination, some work ethic, some grind, some joy. We just haven’t had that.” Gregory’s most valuable trade chip this summer appears to be Durant, who was still one of the NBA’s elite scorers last season at 36. The 15-time All-Star averaged 26.6 points on 53% shooting, shows few signs of slowing and will certainly have multiple suitors during the offseason. Beal — a three-time All-Star — could be much more difficult to unload. The oft-injured guard is due more than $50 million next season, but his production hasn’t come close to matching the price tag. Gregory said he likes both players, but wasn’t ready to comment on their future in the desert. “I have a very good relationship with both those guys,” Gregory said. “Kevin gave me a nice hug in the weight room the other night when the news came across Twitter. Had a great dinner with Brad Beal last Thursday and we talked a little about summer plans and different things like that. “My main focus, to be honest with you, is finding the right head coach for those guys.” Gregory joined the Suns in 2023 and served in several roles, most recently as the vice president of player programming. He had major input in the Suns selecting Ryan Dunn and Oso Ighodaro in last year’s draft and both had promising moments during their rookie seasons. Dunn and Ighodaro featured on-court personalities that seem closer to Ishbia’s gritty ideals, with the young duo featuring an energy and spirit that was conspicuously lacking from much of the rest of the roster. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",N/A

Top-seeded Cleveland was already facing adversity after dropping Game 1 to the Pacers 121-112 on Sunday night. The Cavaliers haven’t lost their first two games at home in the playoffs since 1996 against the New York Knicks in the first round. Mobley, the league’s Defensive Player of the Year, and Hunter were both injured in a 26-second span in the fourth quarter Sunday night. Mobley sprained his left ankle when he was boxed out by Indiana’s Myles Turner and didn’t have room to land after his turnaround hook shot went in. Mobley is averaging 17 points and 7.2 rebounds in the playoffs. Hunter, averaging 23.8 minutes off the bench in the postseason, dislocated the thumb on his right shooting hand after Bennedict Mathurin blocked his running dunk attempt. Dean Wade will start in place of Mobley, while Ty Jerome gets his first postseason start after Sam Merrill got the call the last three games that Garland was out. Kenny Atkinson, voted the NBA’s Coach of the Year on Monday night, was still agitated about the non-calls where his players suffered the injuries. “Even if it’s not malice, we need to see our best players playing in the playoffs,” he said before Tuesday’s game. “This rhetoric going around, people say, ‘Oh man, that’s playoff basketball.’ To me, that’s not. As a stakeholder in this, we need to figure out what is acceptable.” Garland continues to deal with a sprained left big toe. This is the fourth straight playoff game he has missed and has only played two of Cleveland’s last eight games. Jerome leads all NBA bench players in points (17.2) and assists (5.4) per game so far this postseason. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said he understood where Atkinson was coming from because he noted protecting players is part of a coach’s job. “Nobody wants to see players here. That disturbs the hell out of us,” Carlisle said about the injuries. “When you turn in a play to the league, they let the other team know. I don’t want to tell you the number of plays we turned in from the Milwaukee series because that was five games.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",N/A

(AP) — Pinch-hitter Cal Raleigh put Seattle ahead with a two-run single in the ninth inning, Julio Rodríguez went 3 for 4 with a solo home run and the Mariners beat the Athletics 5-3 on Tuesday night. With the Mariners trailing by one, Jorge Polanco drew a one-out walk from reliever Tyler Ferguson (0-1) in the ninth. Rodríguez followed with a single and Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Raleigh’s single to right field gave Seattle a 4-3 lead, and Dylan Moore added a sacrifice fly. Carlos Vargas got three outs for his first major league save, retiring pinch-hitter Seth Brown with two on to end it. Collin Snider (1-0) gave up a go-ahead single to Miguel Andujar in the eighth but prevented further damage. Seattle is 17–6 since April 9, the best record in the big leagues during that span. J.P.

Rodríguez homered in the first inning and Miles Mastrobuoni had an RBI double for the Mariners in the second. Brent Rooker and Tyler Soderstrom each had three hits for the Athletics. Andujar added two hits and two RBIs. Rooker also scored twice — and stole two bases for the first time in his career. Mariners relievers Gabe Speier and Snider got bases-loaded strikeouts to end the seventh and eighth innings, respectively. Seattle is 8-0-2 in its last 10 series with the Athletics and 47–16 over its last 63 games against the A’s.

Verlander winless in 8 starts with the Giants,https://apnews.com/article/giants-justin-verlander-2632d6a004e07ae8a87470c429abea41,Verlander winless in 8 starts with the Giants,"CHICAGO (AP) — It happened again. Justin Verlander was in position for his first win with the San Francisco Giants — but he walked away empty-handed. Verlander pitched five innings Tuesday night against the Chicago Cubs before giving a 5-3 lead to San Francisco’s bullpen. The three-time AL Cy Young Award winner ended up with another no-decision, but the Giants scored nine times in the 11th for a 14-5 victory. “It’s crazy, because he could easily have four or five wins at this point,” San Francisco manager Bob Melvin said. “So just another one of those where we’re a pitch away from getting him a win, and next thing you know he doesn’t, but it doesn’t mean he’s not performing well.” The 42-year-old Verlander signed a $15 million, one-year contract with the Giants in January. He was charged with two losses while going winless in his first eight starts for the longest such drought at any point during his 20 seasons in the majors. “I’m somebody who really tries to focus on the big picture,” Verlander said. “Just try to keep pitching well and giving us a chance to win and that’s doing my job, and wins can come in bunches. It’s a team sport. Not everything is in your control as a starter, and I know that.” Verlander allowed five hits, struck out three and walked two against the NL Central leaders. The big blow was Miguel Amaya’s two-run homer after San Francisco had opened a 4-0 lead in the top of the third. “Obviously, you want some wins,” Verlander said. “I’ve also been somebody who never really expects a lot of wins when I only go five innings. I don’t really feel like I did my job as well as I should have today.” During his season-opening drought, Verlander has been hurt by lackluster run support. He had a 1.96 ERA in 18 1/3 innings over his previous three starts. He was in position to get his first win against Colorado on Thursday, but the lowly Rockies rallied for a 4-3 win. Verlander went 5-6 with a 5.48 ERA in 17 starts for Houston last year. He had stints on the injured list for shoulder inflammation and neck discomfort. The nine-time All-Star became a free agent after he failed to pitch 140 innings, a total that would have triggered his ability to exercise a $35 million conditional player option. Verlander is 262-149 with a 3.31 ERA in 534 career starts. He is tops among active big league pitchers in wins, innings (3,457 2/3), strikeouts (3,451) and starts (534). “I’ve been kind of working my way towards I think being better and better,” Verlander said. “Just kind of stay the course and see what happens. We’ve still got a lot of starts left. It’s really early.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",N/A

(AP) — Logan O’Hoppe drove in the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning, Yoán Moncada followed with a three-run homer, and the Los Angeles Angels rallied to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 on Tuesday night for just their second win in 10 games. Zach Neto hustled home with the tying run to start a six-run rally in the eighth by the Angels, who scored more than five runs in a full game for the first time since April 10. O’Hoppe delivered an RBI single before Moncada hit his first homer since September 2023 in his first game back from a thumb injury. Jo Adell added another homer moments later. George Springer and Anthony Santander homered for the Blue Jays, who opened a six-game trip with their third straight loss. Tyler Anderson recovered from a rocky first inning to pitch six-hit ball into the seventh for the Angels. José Ureña pitched solidly into the fifth inning of his debut with the Blue Jays, who signed the right-hander Monday. Toronto is Ureña’s eighth team in the past six seasons. After Springer hit his fourth homer in the first, Taylor Ward answered with a two-run shot to center, ending his 1-for-35 slump. Santander then golfed a low breaking ball from Ryan Johnson into the short right-field porch with one out in the eighth. Héctor Neris (1-1) came on and got two outs, stranding two Blue Jays. Neto walked, stole second and scored the tying run when Ernie Clement couldn’t handle Alejandro Kirk’s throw to third after the catcher fielded Nolan Schanuel’s poor bunt off Yimi García (0-2). Neto extended his hitting streak to a career-best 11 games with a first-inning single. Yusei Kikuchi (0-4, 4.21 ERA) takes his eighth shot at earning his first win for the Angels. José Berríos (1-1, 3.98) goes for Toronto. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",N/A

Gallen (3-4) had his longest outing of the season, giving up one run on two hits and three walks while striking out six. The right-hander coaxed a double-play grounder from Jeff McNeil in the seventh to end his evening. It was the second time in a week that Gallen frustrated the Mets’ powerful lineup. He gave up just one run over six innings last Thursday in New York during Arizona’s 4-2 win. Gurriel gave the D-backs a 4-1 lead in the sixth by jumping on a first-pitch fastball that David Peterson left over the plate. The two-run shot scored Josh Naylor, who reached on a leadoff walk. Naylor had a sacrifice fly in the seventh that pushed Arizona ahead 5-1. He finished with two runs scored and two RBIs. Gurriel had three hits, including a double. The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the third when Pete Alonso walked with the bases loaded, forcing in Tyrone Taylor. Francisco Alvarez had two of the team’s four hits. Alonso struck out three times. Peterson (2-2) gave up four runs on five hits and four walks over six innings, striking out six. The Mets had runners on first and third with one out in the ninth, but new D-backs closer Shelby Miller retired Brandon Nimmo on a liner and Mark Vientos on a shallow fly to end the game. Gallen threw 101 pitches and Peterson threw 104. It was just the third time in the majors this season that both starters reached 100 pitches. RHP Kodai Senga (3-2, 1.38 ERA) takes the mound for the Mets against RHP Merrill Kelly (3-1, 4.06) and the Diamondbacks on Wednesday. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",N/A
Frederik Andersen returns from missing end of 1st round to help Hurricanes beat Capitals in Game 1,https://apnews.com/article/frederik-andersen-carolina-hurricanes-capitals-553e8b1b5d209218d1f7844f97b4846c,Frederik Andersen returns from missing end of 1st round to help Hurricanes beat Capitals in Game 1,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Frederik Andersen had no choice but to sit and watch his Carolina Hurricanes teammates clinch their first-round series victory and move on in the NHL playoffs. A week later, he was back in net and delivered the kind of quality goaltending they’ve gotten from him whenever he has been healthy. Andersen stopped 13 of the 14 shots he faced as the Hurricanes beat the Washington Capitals 2-1 in overtime in Game 1 of their second-round series. “Just really been looking forward to this for a while,” Andersen said. “Happy we could start off on the right foot.” Andersen was Carolina’s starter to begin the postseason and turned aside 88 of 94 shots before getting injured when New Jersey forward Timo Meier barreled into him in the second period of Game 4 last round. He gave way to backup Pyotr Kotchekov, who finished the job that night and did enough to advance with an overtime victory in Game 5. Extra time off allowed Andersen, a 35-year-old Dane in his 12th season in the league, to heal up. He was not tested much in the opener at Washington, but even the lack of action he had made it more challenging for a veteran coming off a long layoff. “Well that’s tough — it seems easy,” coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “He’s been here long enough (to know) you got to stay focused. And I thought he did a good job.” The Hurricanes pummeled the Capitals with 94 shots attempts: 33 that got on net — two of which went in past Logan Thompson — and 36 that got blocked before reaching him. After Logan Stankoven tied it midway through the third period, Andersen took space away on Ryan Leonard’s breakaway with just under six minutes, a play that did not count as a save but contributed to sending the game to overtime. “You could tell he was on it,” Brind’Amour said. “That was a huge one for us.” Carolina has been used to playing without Andersen, who missed half of 2023-24 getting treatment for blood clots and was out for a few months this season after knee surgery. But the organization showed how important Andersen is, signing him between rounds to a contract for next season, one that could see him earn up to $3.5 million. In his first game since getting that deal, Andersen rewarded the Hurricanes by making the saves he needed to make to give them a series led. “He’s huge for us,” Stankoven said. “We’re trying at the other end to create offense, and when we do give up chances or there are breakdowns, he’s there for us. And he’s been great all playoffs for us, so we’re going to need him to keep playing like that.” ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",N/A
Wild GM Guerin aims for Kaprizov extension and aggressive summer spending with cap constraints gone,https://apnews.com/article/wild-guerin-kaprizov-salary-cap-d8d3c353404578477610ab34e1bbb6d5,Wild GM Guerin aims for Kaprizov extension and aggressive summer spending with cap constraints gone,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Wild have entered a critical offseason, able to fully participate in free agency again after two years of significant salary cap constraints. Without an NHL playoff series win in the last 10 years, the urgency for the club to build a deeper roster around a promising young core is high — putting the pressure on general manager Bill Guerin this summer and into the upcoming season. “I’m more excited than anything. It’s been a long couple years, just dealing with this stuff and honestly just hearing about it,” said Guerin, who has been in his role for six years. “I want high expectations. I’m not doing this job sit in the corner or anything. These are big jobs. These are important jobs. There’s a lot of people out there who love the Minnesota Wild, and I’m trying to deliver something to them. We all are.” The first order of business is clear: an extension for Kirill Kaprizov. The star left wing has one year left on his current contract. “I’m very confident we’re going to get a deal done with Kirill. I think he really loves this market and this team,” Guerin said on Tuesday at Xcel Energy Center, five days after the Wild were eliminated on their home ice. “I think he feels that we’re going in the right direction.” Kaprizov, who has 386 points in 319 regular season games and 21 points in 25 playoff games with the Wild, said as much over the weekend. “I love everything here,” Kaprizov said. “Should be all good.” The Wild barely got in the playoffs in part because Kaprizov missed half of the season with a lower-body injury that required surgery. With five goals and four assists in the six-game loss to Vegas in the first-round series, Kaprizov made clear he was fully recovered. “He just wants to win, and I think this was a promising sign that our team can do it. We can get there. We’re so close,” said left wing Marcus Foligno, reflecting on the three straight one-goal losses that finished the series, including two in overtime. “I’ve got 100% confidence that we’ll get him here long term. Or I’ll just rip up his visa.” Guerin made the bold move four years ago of buying out the contracts of franchise cornerstones Zach Parise and Ryan Suter. The fresh start for team chemistry came at a cost, particularly for the last two seasons with the buyout charges accounting for about 17% of their salary cap. Those hits will be drastically reduced for 2025-26 and beyond until they’re gone. “I like to be aggressive. I don’t want to sit on my hands at all. I’m kind of tired of doing that,” Guerin said. “Since I walked through the door, my goal has been to build a championship-caliber team for this market, and that’s what I want to do. I don’t want to sign any stupid contracts or anything like that, but I want to make this team better than it is today.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL",N/A
LA Kings president expects coach Jim Hiller to remain in charge after GM Blake’s replacement hired,https://apnews.com/article/kings-nhl-blake-hiller-robitaille-d72ce1b3b907cf61be0c988e72decfeb,LA Kings president expects coach Jim Hiller to remain in charge after GM Blake’s replacement hired,"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — Los Angeles Kings president Luc Robitaille expects coach Jim Hiller to remain in charge after the team selects its new general manager. Robitaille expressed strong support for Hiller on Tuesday, one day after GM Rob Blake and the Kings mutually agreed to end Blake’s eight-year tenure. “Your general manager, you want to give him the freedom, you don’t want to lock up a new person that’s coming in, but the record of what Jimmy has done this year is really, really good,” Robitaille said at the Kings’ training complex. “It would be really hard for any GM to say, ‘Well, this guy shouldn’t come back.’ He’s been really good. I think Jimmy’s a great coach, and I fully think that this guy is coming back, for sure.” Hiller has been in charge of the Kings’ bench since February 2024, when the former assistant took over for the fired Todd McLellan. The Kings are 69-37-10 in Hiller’s first job as an NHL head coach, and they matched franchise records with 48 victories and 105 points this season before losing to Edmonton in the first round for the fourth consecutive postseason. Robitaille emphasized that the new GM would have the final say on the coaching staff, but the longtime team president reiterated his overall happiness with the state of the Kings’ roster, their coaching staff and even their style of play despite their repeated playoff disappointments. Robitaille made it clear that Blake supported the decision to seek new team leadership. Robitaille plans to hire a general manager who can provide a fresh perspective on how to change a talent-filled roster that can’t get it done in the postseason. “Blakey and I have been talking about it for probably a year,” Robitaille said. “He always said he wanted to wait to sign (a contract extension). I’m not going to get into detail about our conversation, but it’s something we talked about ... and we both agreed this was better for the franchise.” The former Kings teammates agreed that “it was time to probably bring a new voice just to get us to that next level,” Robitaille added. Los Angeles hasn’t won a playoff series since raising the Stanley Cup in 2014, and the Oilers have bounced the Kings in four straight springs. Los Angeles has won only eight total games in those four first-round series, and Hiller’s club lost its final four in a row last week after winning the first two at home. Robitaille didn’t sound close to hiring Blake’s replacement. He plans to examine multiple candidates, including Marc Bergevin, the former Montreal GM who was a senior adviser to Blake for the past 3 1/2 years. Robitaille isn’t waiting until he hires a new GM to begin preparations for next season. Working with assistant general manager Nelson Emerson, Robitaille has already spoken to pending unrestricted free agents Andrei Kuzmenko and Vladislav Gavrikov, who both played significant roles in Los Angeles’ late-season success. When asked what he sought in a replacement for a general manager of a team coming off one of the best regular seasons in franchise history, Robitaille emphasized the importance of evaluating the Kings’ roster with fresh eyes. “We had a good year ... but it’s sports, and you want to win the last game of the season,” Robitaille said. “That’s our goal.” Robitaille doesn’t necessarily want to see the Kings abandon their regimented, defense-oriented style of play under McLellan and Hiller, however. Fans often criticize Los Angeles’ style as old-fashioned and not offense-forward, but Robitaille offered a passionate defense of a team that stopped relying so heavily on the neutral-zone trap this season and finished 14th in the NHL in goals scored (249). “We had three of the best lines in hockey,” Robitaille said. “We scored goals. We had a 40% power play (at the end of the season). We felt like we needed to tweak our power play, and credit to our guys, they figured it out. Some teams have a 60-goal scorer. We don’t, but we have a lot of guys that can score goals. We play hard. We forecheck. We don’t sit back. ... We want to push.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL",N/A
