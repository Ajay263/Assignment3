Here’s how to dress like a dandy in everyday life","NEW YORK (AP) — Michael Henry Adams had reached a fashion crossroads by the early 1970s: As bell bottoms and afros became the trend and the look of film figures like John Shaft and “Super Fly” became style prototypes, the teenager felt unrepresented. But a previous trip to the Museum of Modern Art, for its “Harlem On My Mind” exhibit, had already begun to lay down his fashion foundation. “When I saw those photographs of elegant Harlemites promenading up and down Seventh Avenue and Lennox Avenue ... the raccoon coats and fox coats, and spangled gowns, and bowler hats — all this satirical splendor ... I thought, ‘Oh! There is another way for me to be authentically Black,’” recalled the New York-based cultural and architectural historian, now 69. The style Adams would embrace had a name: dandyism. And dandyism was at the heart of Monday’s Met Gala, where many of the world’s most famous and influential tastemakers donned their luxury best to kick off the “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” exhibit. But Black dandyism isn’t limited to expensive couture — it’s displayed daily. Cultural and architectural historian Michael Henry Adams poses for a portrait on Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) “It’s everywhere in the Black community, the notion of what a dandy is,” explained Adams, who was photographed for the “Superfine” catalog. “The ingeniousness and ingenuity and creativity of Black people, so far as fashion was concerned, it’s always been with us.” As the menswear-focused exhibit — the Costume Institute’s first to exclusively display Black designers — opens to the public Saturday, here are tips from dandies on embracing the style in everyday life. Dandies say the key to a distinctive look first begins on the inside. “Fashion’s a sense of personality. Two guys can go to the same store and get the same outfit and look totally different,” said Guy Wood, 62, the stylish co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. Inspired by family members and dapper Harlem neighbors, he developed a knack for style early. “It’s confidence ... you walk in the room, and all the heads turn.” Michael Andrew, a 42-year-old Atlanta-based style consultant, first delved into dandyism after being inspired by Fonzworth Bentley, most recognized as Sean “Diddy” Combs’ often-photographed assistant and umbrella holder in the early 2000s. Bentley’s colorful outfits and tailored outfits separated himself from the hip-hop era’s prevalent baggy look. Style advisor, Michael Andrew, poses for a portrait on Friday, May 2, 2025, in Atlanta. (Photo by Paul R. Giunta/Invision/AP) “A lot of guys think that being a dandy is about being over the top,” said Andrew, who was photographed for Rose Callahan’s 2013 book “I Am Dandy: The Return of the Elegant Gentleman.” “For me, dandyism is the highest form of taste with self-expression.” The foundation of dandyism rests upon tenets such as bold colors and fine tailoring, but there’s no singular way to achieve the look. Each dandy creates their own unique style, often centered on specific elements. For Wood, who refers to crafting looks as making gumbo, it starts with suits. “Wearing a suit, you just feel important,” said Wood, who often pairs them with brogue shoes of various bright colors. “We love well-tailored.” James McFarland, an 80-year-old master tailor, says a dandy’s affinity for tailoring is easy to understand: “It’s very simple: we’re a visual world. When you wear something that’s fine tailored and it’s fitting you well, people look at that.” Known as “Gentleman Jim,” McFarland was tutored by Orie Walls, the go-to Harlem-based tailor of the 1960s. McFarland says they crafted suits for nearly every famous Black male celebrity of the time, from Duke Ellington to Jackie Robinson to Muhammad Ali — as well as some of the era’s most infamous characters, like gangsters Frank Lucas and Bumpy Johnson. He says wearing a suit “makes you feel better. You ever heard the term styling and profiling?” While Adams, the historian, is drawn to bow ties, buck shoes and straw hats, Andrew says the beauty of dandyism is making it your own. “Texture is the must-have when you start talking about dandyism — textures and patterns. The great point here is that dandies always have their thing. And so, for me, hats are my thing,” Andrew said, adding that small accessories, like stylish wool or cashmere socks and pocket squares, can easily elevate a look. “Now, it’s starting to become glasses. … Every dandy has the opportunity to utilize something.” Guy Wood, co-owner of Harlem Haberdashery. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton) Wood says creativity is essential to becoming a dandy — not a high income. “That’s a cheat code,” said Wood. “It is being creative … most of us don’t have a lot of money. You might go in your mom’s closet and (think), ‘Oh, that scarf is fly.’ You tie it around your neck and lay it over your shoulder. You just can’t be scared.” Adams says while style and inspiration can go hand-in-hand, individuality should always be paramount. “People should find their truth and aspire to look like themselves,” he said, noting he shops at a variety of stores, from the high-end Brooks Brothers to off-price and discount stores like Marshalls and K&G Fashion. “Part of the thing that made me rebel against looking like ‘Super Fly’ or ‘Shaft’ is I didn’t want to look like everybody else.” Jacques Agbobly, a designer whose clothes are featured in the Met exhibit, agrees. “There are people who would really just think it’s about the suit that you’re wearing and the top hat … but for me, and I think that’s what this exhibition does really fondly, is really putting together a group of amazing clothing that really redefines what dandyism is,” he said. For the Togo-born designer, “taking up space is a sort of open-ended thing in a way,” whether it’s achieved through colors, silhouettes or fabric choices. Rising designer Jacques Agbobly (AP video shot by Joseph Frederick, AP interview/production by Gary Gerard Hamilton) A general consensus among dandies is that society has embraced casualness, shunning the well-dressed looks of the past. McFarland, the tailor, says his profession isn’t as admired or used in U.S. as it was years ago. He teaches fine tailoring as he has for decades, and is planning to start a podcast to discuss the craft and his adventures styling celebrities of his era. “When I grew up, I wanted to look like the people in the neighborhood,” he said, explaining his mother couldn’t afford the clothes he wanted, leading him to tailoring. “Everybody, male and female, was dressed up.” Andrew hopes that same stylish spirit of yesteryear can make a resurgence, believing appearance and pride work together. “I would challenge or would encourage all of us, especially as Black people, to remember our history, to remember that we used to throw on our Sunday’s best,” he said. “We wanted to show up as the best versions of ourselves.” The “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” exhibit, which will run through October, is sure to introduce visitors to the most elevated forms of Black dandyism. But for Wood and fellow daily dandies, it’s just business as usual. “The fact that the Met realizes that is a beautiful thing,” he said with a sly smile. “But we’ve been doing this forever and we really not paying attention to it. We just do it because we love it.” ___ Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.",N/A

Smokey Robinson accused by former housekeepers of sexual assault and rape,https://apnews.com/article/smokey-robinson-la-lawsuit-sexual-assault-1512119eb018782fffad29d1d0358724,Smokey Robinson accused by former housekeepers of sexual assault and rape,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Four former housekeepers of Smokey Robinson allege in a lawsuit filed Tuesday that the Motown music luminary repeatedly sexually assaulted and raped them while they worked for him. The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024, and labor violations including a hostile work environment, illegally long hours and lack of pay. A message seeking comment from a representative for the 85-year-old Robinson was not immediately answered. The four women each say that Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house then sexually assault and rape them over their objections. “We believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,” the women’s attorney John Harris said at a news conference. All said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. “Having to tell their husband and children of these despicable actions left them filled with shame and embarrassment,” Harris said. “So throughout their dreadful experiences with Mr. Robinson, all four women remained silent.” He said as low-wage earners, they also all feared “missing a payday, and not being able to afford rent or buy food for their families.” All four women withheld their legal names citing privacy concerns and are identified as Jane Does in court documents. They appeared at the news conference with their attorneys, but did not speak, and covered their faces with masks. The lawsuit also names Robinson’s wife Frances Robinson as a defendant, alleging that she enabled his behavior despite knowing about past sexual misconduct. It also blames her for the hostile work environment, saying she berated them with language that included ethnic slurs. One woman said she worked for the Robinsons from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said she worked for them from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times. Another said she worked for them for a year before quitting in 2024 and was assaulted at least seven times. The fourth woman, who said she also acted as Frances Robinson’s personal assistant, hairdresser and cook, worked for them for 18 years before resigning in 2024. She cited similar experiences to the other women, but did not say how often she was assaulted. The women, some of whom worked for the Robinsons at the same time as each other, also kept stories of the assaults from one another, but are now bonding over their experience, the attorneys said. They declined to give details at the news conference about how they came forward and learned there were others. The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations. “Obviously, no amount of money can compensate these women for what Mr. Robinson put them through,” Harris said. But he said the $50 million was warranted “based on the gravity of Mr. Robinson’s despicable and reprehensible misconduct.” Plaintiffs’ attorney Herbert Hayden said that while they felt the assaults are worthy of criminal investigation, the women have not filed police reports, based on the same fears that kept them from coming forward. Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s — both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including “Tears of a Clown” and “The Tracks of My Tears.” He was a central part of the Motown Records music machine in his hometown of Detroit as an artist, producer and songwriter for other artists.",N/A
"In pinstripes and hats, with canes and twists on suiting, Met Gala crowd largely did menswear proud",https://apnews.com/article/met-gala-fashion-2025-best-worst-dressed-9a93c25c4bf01db1e35450d7f21f744c,"In pinstripes and hats, with canes and twists on suiting, Met Gala crowd largely did menswear proud","NEW YORK (AP) — Pinstripes. All Ways. Hats galore. Pantsuits. Gown suits. Zoot suits. Canes. A single cigar (looking at you Madonna) — and expert displays of tailoring. The Met Gala crowd, for the most part, did the Black dandy menswear theme proud at fashion’s biggest party of the year. “Those that researched the moment and pulled inspiration from history made it modern and their own. I loved it,” said Holly Alford, assistant dean and an associate professor in the fashion and merchandising program at Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts. Among her favorites: Colman Domingo’s homage to dandy icon André Leon Talley. It was one of many that honored the towering fashion figure, a rare Black fashion editor in a largely white industry. And among others in odes to Talley, who died in 2022, were Anne Hathaway in a Carolina Herrera dress she picked specifically for him. “We wanted André Leon Talley to look down from heaven and scream ‘GLAMOUR,’” Hathaway said on the Vogue livestream Monday night. A glamorous night it was, and an inventive one at that amid a broad White House siege on DEI programs and protections that serve immigrants, LGBTQ+ people and myriad others. What does that have to do with fashion and the theme this year? Everything, in terms of Black power, ownership, heritage and, most importantly, freedom. What, exactly, was the suggested dress code? It was “Tailored for You,” inspired by Black dandyism through time, the subject of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s spring show at its Costume Institute. On the blue carpet, a bit soggy from drenching rain, guests played with the fundamentals of fashion to make their looks their own with the help of designers and stylists. And many honored their heritages in special touches like the cowrie shells on the cuffs of Lewis Hamilton’s Wales Bonner jacket. The shells pay homage to Black diasporic culture, to spirituality, to memory, said Rikki Byrd, assistant professor of visual culture studies at the University of Texas at Austin and founder of the Black Fashion Archive. Tessa Thompson honored Talley with a fan adorned with his image. “It’s representative of a church fan and André Leon Talley often talked about his first introduction to fashion was through his church,” Byrd said. Teyana Taylor was a standout for Shantrelle P. Lewis, author of “Dandy Lion: The Black Dandy and Street Style.” With her cane, in her red velvet cape, “she understood the assignment,” Lewis said. Taylor’s cape was emblazoned with her nickname in honor of her home turf: “Harlem Rose.” And she, like Swizz Beatz, donned a durag. Lewis, who has been seminal in understanding dandyism, said the attire on the carpet was generally underwhelming. “The lack of color, the lack of African print, even the absence of African designers. I said, ‘Where is the Black dandyism?’” she said. “No sartorial risks were taken.” Big risks? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Brandon Tan, fashion director for Cosmopolitan, was satisfied. “A classic silhouette can be completely reimagined by something as simple as the color and fabrication of the textile, as seen on Henry Golding,” he said. “Inversely, a very classic gray wool can be totally remixed by the cut and silhouette like Walton Goggins’ kilt look by Thom Browne.” A few simply showed up in comparatively routine black tuxedos (hello James Corden) and questionable spins on the theme (Sorry, Halle Berry, but that was a lot of skin in the crotch area). Coattails of varying lengths were a huge trend amid the sea of hats and head pieces anticipated ahead of the gala that brought together A-listers from the worlds of sports, entertainment, music, art, literature, politics and more to raise money for the Costume Institute. Black and white looks carried the night, with enough pops of color to keep it interesting. Kevin Huynh, InStyle’s fashion director, also praised Domingo, who wore a huge Talley-esque collared blue cape first, then ditched the cape to reveal a pearled window-pane jacket he wore with dot accessories. “As the undisputed king of the red carpet, his regal look was beyond appropriate for the night’s theme,” Huynh said. “He fully embodied the spirit of dandyism in not one but two statement-making looks from Valentino, and he aced it in terms of being unapologetically bold and flawlessly fanciful.” That “fearlessness and individuality,” he said, is what the night was all about. “After a marathon awards season run, his Met Gala red carpet reveal was well worth the wait. From the moment he stepped out of The Carlyle draped in a jewel-toned Valentino cape, it was clear that more was coming,” said Claire Stern Milch, Elle’s digital director. “And when he finally arrived on the steps, his custom three-piece zoot suit, also designed by Alessandro Michele, was a playful and sophisticated nod to the theme,” she added. Milch called Domingo’s oversized polka dot flower on one lapel undoubtedly the highlight. The look, she said, was the “perfect marriage of classic tailoring and avant-garde flair.” Nikki Ogunnaike, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire, noted that suiting of all kinds wasn’t a huge surprise, considering the style guidance from Vogue’s Anna Wintour, who puts the gala together each year. “My favorites included Ayo Edebiri in Ferragamo, Tracee Ellis Ross in Marc Jacobs, Zendaya and Lisa in Louis Vuitton, Colman Domingo in Valentino and Mindy Kaling in Harbison, all of whom interpreted dandyism and suiting in their own unique way,” she said. Athletes, meanwhile, also took the spotlight. Tailoring for them is a special craft that Tom Marchitelli, custom menswear designer and stylist, takes into consideration with all the suits he creates for NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball players. “These guys have these superhero builds, as I like to say, and they can’t walk into any store on Fifth Ave, in Rodeo, anywhere and just pick out a suit off the rack to fit them,” he said. Marchitelli said he appreciated the clean form-fitting looks on Philadelphia Eagles players Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley. “To have this many athletes showcased, I think that says a lot about how important sport is to culture, pop culture in America, how influential the athletes are,” he said. The night’s vibe was inspired by the exhibit called “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” It’s the first Costume Institute show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Big-time Black designers and smaller brands of creatives of color were represented on the carpet. They included Sergio Hudson, LaQuan Smith and Ozwald Boateng, a former wunderkind of Savile Row. So who are some others who blew it, or didn’t even try to spin the theme? Blackpink’s Lisa might have walked the line in her look by Vuitton, a gala sponsor. She went pantless with little faces on black undies to go with her matching jacket and LV logo sheer stockings. Some on social media thought the faces were Rosa Parks. They weren’t, a representative told The Cut, explaining they were “portraits of figures who have been a part of the artist’s life.” OK. So it goes. Undie portraits might not be a good idea in general. As for Corden, The Cut posted a video of him in his mere mortal look and viewers threw some barbs, including one who called him “James Boredon” giving “a total snooze fest per usual.” Ouch, James. ___ For more coverage of the 2025 Met Gala, visit https://apnews.com/hub/met-gala.",N/A
Man arrested after ramming car into front gate of Jennifer Aniston’s Los Angeles home,https://apnews.com/article/jennifer-aniston-los-angeles-home-arrest-crash-22242e5a78afcb304b7d2d91bb4748c5,Man arrested after ramming car into front gate of Jennifer Aniston’s Los Angeles home,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A man was arrested after crashing a car into the front gate at Jennifer Aniston’s home in Los Angeles, authorities said Tuesday. Police told KABC-TV that the “Friends” star was home at the time of the crash. The incident occurred around 12:20 p.m. Monday on the 900 Block of Airole Way in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood, according to Officer Jeff Lee of the LA Police Department. Online property records show a home on that block owned by a trust run by Jennifer Aniston’s business manager. Private security guards apprehended the driver and held him until police arrived. Lee described the suspect as a white middle-aged man. He has not been identified, and no charges had been filed as of Tuesday morning, Lee said. “He used his vehicle to ram a gate to the residence,” Lee said. Messages were left Tuesday with representatives and attorneys for Aniston. Aniston, currently starring in Apple TV’s “Morning Show,” purchased the midcentury mansion on a 3.4-acre lot for about $21 million in 2012, according to reporting by Architectural Digest.",N/A
Things to know about the trial of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs,https://apnews.com/article/diddy-combs-trial-jury-cassie-20ad227adf8fe2e03caf782c2f3c1063,Things to know about the trial of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs,"NEW YORK (AP) — The sex trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, one of the biggest music moguls and cultural figures of the past four decades, began Monday in New York with jury selection. Twelve jurors along with six alternates will be chosen, with opening statements expected to begin May 12. The trial is expected to last at least eight weeks. Here’s a look at some of the details. Combs is charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty. The alleged offenses span from about 2004 until about 2024. Two of the counts were added a month before trial. The indictment against him says he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. Prosecutors allege he used his “power and prestige” as a music star to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers in events dubbed “freak offs.” Prosecutors revealed shortly before trial that Combs rejected a plea agreement that might have meant a lighter sentence than a conviction could. They did not disclose the terms of the proposed deal. Without identifying them publicly, prosecutors have said four of Combs’ accusers will testify at the trial. The prosecution will be allowed to show the jury security video of Combs beating and kicking one of his accusers, the R&B singer Cassie, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Diddy’s attorneys are expected to argue at trial that the government is demonizing and distorting the sexual activity of consenting adults. They have also argued that two of Combs’ longtime girlfriends willingly brought a male sex worker into their relationship. Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, was Combs’ on-again-off-again romantic partner for more than a decade. Her 2023 lawsuit against Combs alleging years of abuse, including rape, began the scrutiny that eventually led to his prosecution. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Ventura did. The trial is in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian. He’s a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and was appointed a federal judge by President Joe Biden in 2022. The prosecution team consists of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was among the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Combs’ team of seven defense attorneys is led by New York lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who along with his wife Karen Friedman Agnifilo is also defending Luigi Mangione, the man accused of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also on the defense team is Atlanta attorney Brian Steel, who represented Young Thug in a trial that went on for nearly two years before the rapper pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges. Combs, 55, has been held at a federal jail in Brooklyn since his September arrest. His formerly jet-black hair is now almost completely gray because dye isn’t allowed at the detention center. Combs, who had his own fashion line, has worn yellow jail uniforms in pretrial hearings. But for the trial, the judge said he can have up to five button-down shirts, five pairs of pants, five sweaters, five pairs of socks and two pairs of shoes without laces. Under federal court rules, no photos or video of the trial will be allowed. Courtroom sketches are permitted. Since 2023, dozens of women and men have been filing lawsuits against Combs claiming he sexually or physically abused them. Many of those people said they were slipped drugs at events hosted by Combs and were abused while they were incapacitated. Combs has denied all of the allegations through his lawyers. Some of those lawsuits have claimed that other celebrities were either present for or participated in the abuse. The great majority of those allegations, however, aren’t part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on a relatively small number of accusers and allegations where there is physical evidence or corroboration by witnesses.",N/A

It’s like one giant roller coaster ride and once it gets going, it sort of doesn’t stop.” “The Old Guard 2” (Netflix, streaming): Charlize Theron is back with her immortal team for a new mission.

And then also the big magic world of Superman being in the world of the DCU with flying dogs and robots and giant monsters.” There’s romance with Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane, and a “pretty scary” Lex Luthor in Nicholas Hoult. “He’s actually going to kill (Superman),” Gunn said. “And that’s cool to see.” “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight ” (Sony Pictures Classics, theaters): Actor Embeth Davidtz directs and stars in this critically acclaimed adaptation of Alexandra Fuller’s bestselling memoir of growing up on a farm in the former Rhodesia before and after the 1980 election, as the colonial system crumbles.

They’re a benevolent group of wee blue villagers who, you know, want to love one another and lead productive lives while fending off the world’s forces of evil, usually represented by the machinations of some wizards out for ill gotten gains.” “Eddington” (A24, theaters): Ari Aster re-teams with Joaquin Phoenix for this film about a standoff between a small-town sheriff and a mayor in the early months of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler also star.

James Gunn predicts summer of ‘Superman’ to the rescue of the box office,https://apnews.com/article/warner-bros-superman-james-gunn-c2c66cf059138b1cfa90da8d9dc24e19,James Gunn predicts summer of ‘Superman’ to the rescue of the box office,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The 2025 box office has been hit with a deficit. Can the James Gunn-dubbed “summer of ‘Superman’” save it? Warner Bros. showed off a diverse and starry slate of its upcoming films on Tuesday, but the night was carried on the shoulders of Clark Kent. “I really do believe in this movie. And I do believe that there is a lack of human kindness, or at least a degradation of human kindness,” Gunn said. “This is a movie that celebrates kindness and human love.” At the annual CinemaCon convention and trade show in Las Vegas, Gunn — the director and writer of the first film in the new iteration of the connected DC Universe — brought out its stars, who gushed over their experience making the film. “It’s a great honor to play a role that exists so clearly in the public consciousness, to the point where everyone I think, even if you haven’t seen a film or read a comic, you sort of know what the Superman symbol means and you know what it stands for,” said David Corenswet, adding that he hopes to “illuminate something new about the character, or even just bring the beloved character to a new audience.” Corenswet was joined onstage by Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Lois Lane, and Nicholas Hoult, who plays Lex Luthor. “James makes a family out of every set,” Brosnahan said. “The set is full of people who want to be there, who love making these movies. And it’s such a joy to come to work every day. As many of you have probably heard from other people, it’s not always like that.” Gunn was announced as the film’s director in 2023, shortly after he and Peter Safran became co-chairs and co-CEOs of DC Studios. “We appreciate and share your passion for this art form,” Safran told a room full of theater owners. “It’s the fulcrum of our ambitious DC Studios slate and it’s what inspired James to shoot all over the world and push filmmaking technology to its limits, to propel moviegoers out of their homes into your theaters.” The film will be released theatrically in July amid a summer of superhero titles, including “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” and “Thunderbolts.” In addition to “Superman,” Warner Bros. teased some of its April releases on the convention’s main stage, like Ryan Coogler’s “Sinners” and “A Minecraft Movie,” but they also looked further down the road for 2025. In a nod to cinephiles, the studio kicked off its presentation by bringing out the stars of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” including Leonardo DiCaprio and Regina Hall. The film is set to hit theaters in September. “I’ve been wanting to work with Paul for over, gosh, almost 20 years now. He’s one of the most unique talents of our time,” DiCaprio said. “With this film, he’s tapped into something politically and culturally that is brewing beneath our psyche. But at the same time, it’s an incredibly epic movie and has such scope and scale.” Director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer also treated the audience to an extended sneak peak of “F1,” Brad Pitt’s Formula One racing drama premiering in June. In addition to Hollywood studios and stars boasting the theatrical menus they believe will lure audiences to cinemas, the annual convention is also a time to discuss current industry debates, like how long movies should stay in theaters and the extent to which studios should get into production with streaming companies. ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Lex Luthor.",N/A
Summer Movies: 11 breakout actors to watch,https://apnews.com/article/summer-movies-2025-breakout-stars-c10ca7245748efdd6b7173aad61e9106,Summer Movies: 11 breakout actors to watch,"Many of the big movies this summer might come from familiar places — whether they’re franchises, sequels or hybrid adaptations of beloved animated classics. But look closer and there are quite a few fresh faces making a splash with memorable characters new and old. The Associated Press spoke to 10 of the actors about the roles. Maia Kealoha was 6 years old when she saw an advertisement for an open casting call for the new hybrid “Lilo & Stitch” movie and promptly told her parents that’s what she wanted to do. Now 8, Kealoha, who was born on Hawaii’s Big Island, is making her film debut as the spirited Lilo in Disney’s new live-action adaptation, hitting theaters on May 23. “It was so amazing,” Kealoha said. “I was really proud of myself.” Sydney Elizebeth Agudong, who plays Lilo’s older sister and caregiver Nani, praised her young co-star. “It was amazing building a world with her,” Agudong, 24, said. “It’s a lot of CGI and we’re working with aliens and such and she was full of imagination and creativity.” Sydney Agudong, as Nani, in a scene from “Lilo & Stitch.” (Disney via AP) Hailing from Kaua’i, Agudong also came to the role from an open casting call. Being part of the film has been a special experience as a lifelong fan of the animated version and a proud Hawaii resident. “Hawaii’s very much like tough love and soft heart,” Agudong said. “We truly created a family and hopefully people can see that.” Happy Gilmore is a dad in the sequel coming to Netflix on July 25. The Gilmore boys, played by Ethan Cutkosky (“Shameless”), Conor Sherry (“Shake Shack”), Maxwell Jacob Friedman (a pro wrestler) and newcomer Philip Schneider, “are just goons,” Schneider said. All came to the project strangers, though intimately familiar with a film they’d all grown up with. And everyone but Friedman, 29, had to prove they had a little skill on the ice. “I looked like a goon so they just assumed I’d be fine on the rink,” Friedman laughed. This image released by Netflix shows, background from left, Philip Schneider as Bobby, Maxwell Friedman as Gordie, Ethan Cutkosky as Wayne, Conor Sherry as Terry and John Daly as John Daly in “Happy Gilmore 2.” (Scott Yamano/Netflix via AP) The four actors quickly found their rhythm together on set in Jersey City playing the rambunctious, troublemaking Gilmore spawn during the four-month shoot. “The fast pace of stupidity that we got to and what made us family was such an amazing thing,” Cutkosky, 25, said. “It’s really hard to come by.” Friedman added: “In between scenes, we could like look at each other and know what we were thinking and make each other laugh without talking.” Schneider, 24, attributed the atmosphere to their on-screen dad Adam Sandler, who made the whole set feel like a family. His genius, Schneider said, “is that he gets people he wants to work with and just sees what happens. He trusts the chemistry.” For Sherry, it was helpful so early in his career to get to see how Sandler could be both a giant in the industry and so humble. “That’s the dream, right? To balance both,” Sherry, 24, said. This image released by A24 shows Eva Victor in a scene from “Sorry, Baby.” (Mia Cioffy Henry/A24 via AP) One of the breakout films from Sundance was “Sorry, Baby,” a poignant drama that’s both funny and shattering about the aftermath of a traumatic event. It’s the feature debut of triple threat Eva Victor, who wrote, directed and stars as Agnes, a graduate student at a New England school. “I wanted to make a film that was about feeling stuck when everyone around you keeps moving that really didn’t center any violence,” said Victor, 31, who uses they/she pronouns. Victor, who had a recurring role on “Billions,” was making short comedy videos online and writing for the satirical website Reductress when Oscar-winning “Moonlight” filmmaker Barry Jenkins messaged them and asked if they had any scripts. Now, that script is going to be in theaters on June 27, through A24. “I hope the film finds people when they need it,” Victor said. This image released by Sony Pictures shows Ben Wang in a scene from “Karate Kid: Legends.” (Jonathan Wenk/Sony Pictures via AP) Ben Wang didn’t know he was up against some 10,000 people vying to play the new Karate Kid. The 25-year-old actor, best known for his role on the Disney+ series “American Born Chinese,” learned that after the fact. But it was a stressful month of not sleeping very well while waiting to hear if he got it, he said. “Karate Kid: Legends” (out May 30) brings together Jackie Chan’s Mr. Han and Ralph Macchio’s Daniel LaRusso for this new entry, about a teenager at a new school, Wang’s Li, who has to learn from both. “It’s a fun one to play,” Wang said. “And I get to try to kick Jackie Chan, which is new and exciting for me.” Nico Parker grew up with both the “How to Train Your Dragon” books and movies, so it was a dream come true when she got the chance to play Astrid in the new live-action adaptation (June 13). Mason Thames, left, and Nico Parker in a scene from “How to Train Your Dragon.”, (Universal Pictures via AP) “It’s a difficult thing when there’s already such a brilliant version of Astrid out there,” Parker, 20, said. “The main thing that I really wanted to be prevalent in everything was how driven she is and how it doesn’t come easy. It takes effort and skill and determination.” Parker, the daughter of actor Thandiwe Newton and director Ol Parker, has been on sets her whole life. She was only 11 when she filmed Tim Burton’s “Dumbo.” But this feels different, she said, because she really understands the scale and scope of being in a major franchise. “To be older I feel as if I’m acknowledging way more what it means and doesn’t mean,” she said. “And I get much more stressed about it.” This image released by Neon shows Benjamin Pajak in a scene from “The Life of Chuck.” (Neon via AP) You can’t blame filmmaker Mike Flanagan for assuming Benjamin Pajak was a skilled dancer. Pajak made his Broadway debut as Winthrop in “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster. But ask Pajak, now 14, and he demurs that dancing is not exactly his strong suit. But you would never guess that to see him waltzing and sambaing across the floor (thanks to Mandy Moore’s choreography) in “The Life of Chuck” (out June 6). “Film is so different from theater,” Pajak said. “But there were just so many people kind of lifting me up and helping me throughout the process.” One of those was Mark Hamill, who plays his grandfather. Perhaps even more exciting than being in the movies? Sharing scenes with Luke Skywalker. Krypto the dog, in a scene from “Superman.” (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP) Superman’s very good boy Krypto might be a computer-generated creation, but the inspiration was a very real dog: filmmaker James Gunn’s rescue Ozu. It was difficult transition to life in a home — Ozu destroyed shoes, furniture and even his laptop. Gunn, who was at work writing “Superman,” thought, “How difficult would it be if Ozu had superpowers?” That was how Krypto came to be part of the newest “Superman” (out July 11), changing the story and the script. The white pup features prominently in the film’s trailer. At the Puppy Bowl earlier this year, Gunn said that Krypto is lovable and mischievous and has all the powers of Superman — yes, he can fly too. ___ For more coverage of this summer’s upcoming films, visit https://apnews.com/hub/movies.",N/A
"Movie Review: ‘Thunderbolts’ is Marvel, and Florence Pugh, in high gear",https://apnews.com/article/thunderbolts-review-marvel-florence-pugh-6617d8217ed6c96a364e10132ae98394,"Movie Review: ‘Thunderbolts’ is Marvel, and Florence Pugh, in high gear","As they so often do in Marvel Land, worlds collide in “Thunderbolts.” But in this refreshingly earthbound iteration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the collision isn’t a matter of interplanetary strife. “Thunderbolts” has been touted as the unlikely meeting of two of the dominant forces in 21st century American movies: Marvel and A24. This isn’t a co-production, but much of the creative team and many of the stars have ties to the indie studio. “Thunderbolts” is directed by Jake Schreier, who has directed many episodes of the A24 series “Beef,” and was written by Joanna Calo (also a “Beef” veteran) and Eric Pearson (a Marvel veteran). The connections go further: cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo (“A Ghost Story,” “The Green Knight”), editor Harry Yoon (“Minari”) and a score by the band Son Lux (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”). Some trailers for “Thunderbolts” have highlighted these connections, perhaps in hopes of a little A24 auteur cool rubbing off on Hollywood’s superhero factory. It’s also a sign of how rough things have gotten for Marvel that, after a string of misfires, it’s leaning on the studio behind “Swiss Army Man” for its latest would-be blockbuster. Does that make “Thunderbolts” a hipper superhero movie? Can you expect “Babygirl”-like scenes of Black Widow drinking a glass of milk? The answer, of course, is that “Thunderbolts” has no more indie cred than “Avatar.” What it is, though, is the best Marvel movie in years. “Thunderbolts,” about a group of MCU rejects who band together after CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine ( Julia Louis-Dreyfus ) tries to erase them and their covert program, is both a return to form for Marvel and something a little different. While there’s plenty of franchise building going on, “Thunderbolts” — the title of which bears an asterisk — is pleasantly stand-alone, and its spurts of spectacle more deftly proceed out of an tenderly told story. If there’s an influence on “Thunderbolts,” it’s less A24 than James Gunn. It borrows a little of the misfit irreverence of “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “The Suicide Squad.” But Schreier’s film is leaner and less antic than those movies, and it serves as an IMAX-sized platform for the increasingly obvious movie-star talents of Florence Pugh. In the opening moments of “Thunderbolts,” Pugh’s Yelena Belova, a veteran of the Soviet assassin Black Widow program, melancholily stands atop a skyscraper. “There’s something wrong with me,” she says. “An emptiness.” She drops, a parachute opens, and her narration continues. “Or maybe I’m just bored.” It’s a telling opening for a film that wrestles sometimes earnestly, sometimes a little glibly, with malaise and depression. Yelena is searching for meaning in her life, dragged down by guilt and shame from her past, a pain that even her relentlessly chipper father Alexei, the self-proclaimed Red Guardian (David Harbour, magnificent), can’t quell. When Yelena, on a mission, brutalizes a hallway full of armed guards — a shot that, as I critic, am contractually obligated to note is styled after the famous one from Park Chan-wook’s “Oldboy” — Schreier films it from overhead in a shadowy ballet. Shadows and death drape “Thunderbolts.” When Yelena is dispatched on what she says will be her last job, she’s surprised to encounter others like her — include the disgraced John Walker (Wyatt Russell) and the fight-mimicking Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) — sent to the same location. After some initial tussling, they realize they — like the protagonists of “Toy Story 3” — are standing inside of an incinerator. Adding to the confusion of their predicament is a guy with no apparent powers who simply introduces himself as “Bob” (Lewis Pullman, bringing a sensitivity rarely found in these movies). They aren’t quite a bizarro Avengers, but they — including Sebastian Stan’s Bucky Barnes, who joins later — are all the products of dubious government programs that instill less patriotism than their more plainly heroic counterparts. As a group, they’re plagued by doubt and uncertainty, and they’re more inclined to bicker than give rousing speeches. And whenever anyone brushes too closely with Bob, they drift back into the darkest chapters of their own pasts that pull them like a deadweight toward suicidal thoughts. Who, exactly, Bob turns out to be furthers this theme in “Thunderbolts,” which never feels like it’s lurching from one action set piece to another. That the final act of the movie is essentially set in a headspace, rather than above a threatened metropolis, is a testament to the interiority (not a word that often comes up in Marvel movies) of “Thunderbolts,” a film that finds vivid comic-book imagery to render authentic real-life emotions. That’s always been the promise of a good comic book, but it’s fair to say that the Marvel movies have recently found that tone elusive. When Louis-Dreyfus, looking just as home in Washington, D.C., as she was in “Veep,” as De Fontaine declares, “The Avengers are not walking through that door,” it’s an acknowledgment — like then-Celtics coach Rick Pitino once vowed of Larry Bird — that “Thunderbolts” is here to make the most of what it’s got. Of course, that there are, in fact, more “Avengers” films on the way slightly diminishes the sentiment. But they won’t be missed in “Thunderbolts.” All the assembled parts here, including an especially high-quality cast (even Wendell Pierce!) work together seamlessly in a way that Marvel hasn’t in some time. Most of all, Pugh commands every bit of the movie. It’s less a revelation than a big-budget confirmation of the screen power of an actor who also has gone from A24 (“Midsommar”) to Marvel stardom with ease. “Thunderbolts,” a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violence, language, thematic elements, and some suggestive and drug references.

"Meet David Corenswet, cinema’s new Superman",https://apnews.com/article/superman-david-corenswet-summer-movie-preview-28021942374758920088a7e5891855e8,"Meet David Corenswet, cinema’s new Superman","In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record. David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his “pie in the sky ambition” was to play Superman. At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: “The Politician” and “Hollywood.” Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him. But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn’s “Superman” which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he’d manifested it into existence. “I said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,” Corenswet, 31, said. “I sort of was thinking of it as, ‘Oh, who wouldn’t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn’t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?’” Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West’s movie “Pearl.” In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl’s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too. “David was one of the very first auditions that I got,” Gunn said. “Instantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in ‘Pearl.’ He had a sense of humor. That made me go, ‘Ooh, this might be a really good match.’” That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was “extensive,” Corenswet said it was one of the most “satisfying audition processes” he’s ever gone through — not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer. Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him. “Superman is a square and David is a square,” Gunn said. “He listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That’s what he listens to on his iPad. That’s weird. But oh, so Superman.” When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn’t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course. “She texted, ‘Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?’” he said. “I said, ‘Yes. Super good news.’” It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor’s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve’s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill’s, which he called a “marvel of engineering.” But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was “wonderfully mundane.” The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he’d already started putting on weight for the role. “I remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,” Corenswet said. “We had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.” The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew. “I saw their faces sort of light up and I went, ‘Wait a minute, these people aren’t that fond of me,’” he laughed. “That’s when it hits you.” Gunn, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, and Corenswet at CinemaCon in April. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There’s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There’s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there’s Superman. “He’s a public facing character, he’s a symbol,” Corenswet said. “There’s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn’t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.” To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6’8” and 270 pounds, but is the “quietest, most wonderful man.” “That’s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,” Corenswet said. “He’s this big presence, but he’s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.” Gunn has promised that the film is “a personal journey for Superman that’s entirely new.” He’s a character who is “pretty damn good, but flawed.” And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane — but there’s even a different spin on that. “He’s in love with her,” Gunn said. “She’s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It’s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.” Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with “longing romance and witty comedy.” Fitting for their reporter characters, “His Girl Friday” was also a big reference with “the rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.” (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet’s profile immeasurably. He’s been in big movies before, including “Twisters.” But being Superman is different. “The thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,” he said. “I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.” Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point. “I expect some things will change when the film comes out,” he said. “But you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.” ___ For more on this year’s summer movie season, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/movies",N/A
"Movie Review: ‘Rust’ is a serviceable Western, haunted throughout by its tragic offscreen history",https://apnews.com/article/rust-movie-review-alec-baldwin-shooting-289861a894b85b6e1c0ddf735da8942d,"Movie Review: ‘Rust’ is a serviceable Western, haunted throughout by its tragic offscreen history","Surely, bringing an audience to tears with a poignant ending is something every filmmaker dreams of. And yet the moment that inspires a genuine, unambiguous tear in “Rust” is born of a true nightmare. “...for Halyna,” the screen reads as the film comes to a close. Halyna Hutchins’ name also appears in Ukrainian. And we’re given a favored quote from the late cinematographer: “What can we do to make this better?” Just as there’s no way to make this film’s offscreen history any better, there’s no way to write a normal review of a movie that is anything but. “Rust” has inevitably and inexorably become synonymous with tragedy: Hutchins’ shocking death during an on-set rehearsal, when producer-star Alec Baldwin pointed a pistol at her that somehow contained a live round. It discharged, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. An involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin was dismissed. The movie’s weapons supervisor is serving an 18-month prison sentence. And eventually, the film was finished, with Souza returning and cinematographer Bianca Cline replacing Hutchins. Souza said at the film’s premiere in Poland that the family wanted Hutchins’ work to be seen. The movie’s terse publicity materials note that the original producers will not gain financially from it, and that although terms of a settlement were sealed, “it has been confirmed that (husband Matthew) Hutchins and son Andros will receive profits from the film.” In any case, the movie is here. It is not, as many surely expect, a uniformly shoddy effort. The plot is basic and the dialogue merely serviceable, but there are lovely scenery shots throughout, the vastness, gentle light and deep colors of the American West illustrated carefully and evocatively by Hutchins’ — and Cline’s — camera work. Yes, the cinematography is what stands out here. There are also several compelling performances, though Baldwin’s somewhat halting, somber turn is not among them. Most of all, though, there’s not a moment in “Rust” in which one loses awareness of the tragedy. While the scene we’ve all read about does not appear, there is constant gunfire, this being a Western. It’s hard to forget about a shooting while watching so much shooting. In fact, we begin with an accidental shooting. The unfortunate perpetrator is Lucas Hollister, a teenager in 1880s Wyoming who’s recently been orphaned, along with his little brother. We learn later that their father shot himself a year after their mother died. So Lucas (Patrick Scott McDermott, in an accomplished performance) has become the parent. On a trip into town, Lucas gets into a scuffle with another boy who’s insulting their late mother, hurting him. The rancher father demands that Lucas come work for him to pay off his debt. And when he comes to the desolate farm where the boys live to get him, Lucas accidentally shoots and kills him, while aiming at a wolf. A judge decides the crime was premeditated and sentences the boy to the gallows. His little brother comes each night to the prison to sleep next to him. Things look bleak — until a shadowy character with a white beard comes to break him out of the jailhouse, killing whoever gets in the way. “You tell any SOB who comes after me that he will shake hands with the devil himself,” says the mystery man. It’s Harlan Rust (Baldwin), a notorious outlaw who hasn’t been seen for years. He is also Lucas’ estranged grandfather, having been alerted to the boy’s plight by his sister (Frances Fisher, excellent). Thus begins the great chase. Rust and Lucas flee towards Mexico, the only place they can be safe. On their tail are a plethora of pursuers: Sheriff Wood Helm (Josh Hopkins) and various bounty hunters, chief among them the brutal Fenton “Preacher” Lang (Travis Fimmel, appropriately fearsome). The two don’t get along at first — they never do, in such stories — and Lucas aches to get back to his brother. But Rust convinces him it’s better to stay alive. Eventually, luck runs out for the pair, and someone will have to pay. But for its unique circumstances, one can imagine “Rust” coming and going without much of a ripple. The question now is, who is going to be seeing this movie? Certainly many people will come — or watch at home — out of morbid curiosity. What they will find is a movie better in some aspects — especially, and poignantly, the cinematography — than they may have suspected. But it is one that will always be defined, and reflected in every frame, by its tragic history. And there’s no real way to make that better. “Rust,” a Falling Forward release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 139 minutes. One and half stars out of four.",N/A
Movie Review: Thriller ‘The Surfer’ brings Nicolas Cage to a boil,https://apnews.com/article/surfer-review-nicolas-cage-311b8242c24b50ba6189de63cdfdaa10,Movie Review: Thriller ‘The Surfer’ brings Nicolas Cage to a boil,"For a long, sun-addled stretch, Lorcan Finnegan’s beach-set “The Surfer” simmers as a deliciously punishing nightmare, driving Nicolas Cage into his most natural state: a boil. “Don’t live here, don’t surf here,” is the slogan at a pristine stretch of beach along Luna Bay on the Australian coast where our unnamed protagonist (Cage) has come to surf with his teenage son (Finn Little). The “locals only” signs, though, don’t deter him. He was born there, and has come back to surf the break and show his son the million-dollar house on the hills nearby he plans to buy. But the situation rapidly disintegrates. He’s roughed up by the pushy local surfers, his son takes off, and one issue after another keeps him stuck there on a hillside overlooking the ocean. Anyone who comes to “The Surfer” expecting glamorous photography of perfectly tubular waves will be disappointed. This is a movie that gets a remarkable amount of mileage out of a parking lot. It also belongs to that small niche of films where things get so unbearably terrible for the protagonist that the psychodrama becomes more a matter of endurance than pure entertainment. I’m thinking of movies like “U-turn” or “Affliction” — films where a character’s inability to reckon with their reality spirals miserably. As time wears on, Cage’s character gets bloodied, sunburned and incredibly thirsty, and the film grows hallucinatory and surreal. There are snakes, rats and bird eggs. The Lexus he arrives in is towed. His suit gets dusty and ripped. Small nuisances — a dead cellphone battery — accumulate. The sun seems to be melting his brain, so much so that he’s no longer sure of who he is, and we start to doubt what’s real, too. What’s happening here? The Surfer, as he’s credited, is hell-bent on reclaiming something. He envisions reuniting with his family at the new house, but his separated wife, on the phone, tells him she wants a divorce. Is “The Surfer,” penned by Thomas Martin, a metaphor for knowing when to cut bait? Cage’s character won’t accept his loses, and so he ultimately comes to risk much more. When Finnegan begins to answer these questions in a third act that brings us closer to the surfer bros on the beach, “The Surfer” becomes more tolerable to watch and yet less transfixing. The beach gang, led by a man named Scally (Julian McMahon), are something of a cult for reviving an old-fashioned idea of masculinity. With this turn, the strong undertow of “The Surfer” dissipates. But if there was ever an actor to elevate pulpy, not-fully formed genre material, it’s Cage. His performance of a man brought to near-disintegration can be neatly filed alongside Cage’s many other head trips to the brink. All he needs is a bluff above a beach to make “The Surfer” churn with the currents of a man tenuously close to being swept out to sea. “The Surfer,” a Roadside Attractions release that’s in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language, suicide, some violence, drug content and sexual material. Running time: 103 minutes. Three stars out of four.",N/A
Movie Review: ‘April’ is shattering and essential,https://apnews.com/article/april-review-dea-kulumbegashvili-c33455c1989893afe678f8cc6d5edfec,Movie Review: ‘April’ is shattering and essential,"Whatever cruelness you might assign to the month, Dea Kulumbegashvili’s “April” probably has it beat. Kulumbegashvili’s shattering, sensational film is set in a hardscrabble, provincial region of Georgia, the Eastern European country. Nina (Ia Sukhitashvili) is the leading obstetrician at the local hospital and she leads a punishing life. In the film’s opening scenes, she delivers a baby — Kulumbegashvili films it from overhead — who doesn’t cry once born. Sterile hallways and men demanding answers follow the stillbirth and the fleshy, bloody images of the operating room. Though Nina has done thousands of deliveries, the father calls for a police investigation. Left alone with Nina, he tells her he knows she gives abortions in the village. He calls her a murderer and spits on her. Nina experiences the moment with horror and silence, a pervading register in “April.” Kulumbegashvil’s film is formally composed and rigorously opaque, but it churns with an underlying, aching despair. Abortion — legal but fraught in Georgia — is central to “April.” But Nina’s predicament and loneliness stem from something even deeper. Again and again, “April” places its solitary female protagonist in scenes where every gesture — professional or intimate — is treated as lesser, an imbalance that’s violently and brutally impressed upon Nina. In “April,” where Nina traverses a harsh, isolating landscape, the most resonate, disquieting sounds are the soft, sad murmurs of the deaf-mute teen (Roza Kancheishvili) for whom Nina performs a kitchen table abortion. It’s a procedure, shot statically from the side with only half of her visible, necessitated by a mysterious rape. The girl’s mother has no answers. In “April,” even howls of pain go unuttered, and only the storm cloud skies cry. “April” confirms Kulumbegashvili as among the most essential and uncompromising European filmmakers, extending the promise of her 2020 debut “Beginning,” about the wife of a Jehovah’s Witness leader. A prize-winner at last fall’s Venice Film Festival, “April” could be accused of leaning too much into an austere, art-film obliqueness. But Kulumbegashvili’s absolute control over the camera and the intensity of her calling make her film a grimly spellbinding and unforgettable experience. Nina says little through the course of “April,” but when she does, it’s powerful. Being on the front lines of treating women in a place where their freedom is so restricted has brought Nina closer to desperation. When the investigation proceeds, she flatly tells her boss, “Other than my job, I have nothing to lose.” Sukhitashvili’s deft performance is most expressive in her yearning eyes. Cinematographer Arseni Khachaturan, trading objective and subjective perspectives, toggles between images of Nina alone — driving at night, looking for a sexual partner — or crowded by men. When she explains the stillbirth circumstances, we see her view: three men, sitting in judgment. Mixed throughout are separate, unexplained scenes of a faceless, humanlike figure with drooping, unformed bags of skin. We see her slowly shifting from one foot to the other, and hear her breathing heavily. Who is this? Is it a malformed expression of Nina’s tortured soul? Is it some adult fetus whose plight, in contrast to the unborn, has no sympathizers? These are some of the questions that this haunting film leave you to ponder. “April,” a Metrograph Pictures release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. In Georgian, with English subtitles.

"Movie Review: A tactile, retro-coded fantasy in ‘The Legend of Ochi’",https://apnews.com/article/legend-of-ochi-movie-review-aa4ee5a43fa992e9a05d375a3d73b90e,"Movie Review: A tactile, retro-coded fantasy in ‘The Legend of Ochi’","“The Legend of Ochi,” a scrappy and darkly whimsical fable about a misunderstood teenage girl on a dangerous quest, has the feeling of a film you might have stumbled on and loved as a kid. Something tactile, something fantastical and, maybe, something a little dangerous — the kind of movie you knew you probably weren’t supposed to be seeing just yet. They’re the ones that tend to linger, like that strange English dub of the Norwegian adventure “Shipwrecked” that I once saw on the Disney Channel at an impressionable age. Perhaps this is something familiar only to those first home video generations, from a naive, pre-social media era when the movies that you loved felt like your own personal discovery and secret, no matter if it was “Star Wars” or “The NeverEnding Story.” How disappointing it was to learn later that everyone else loved them too. It’s no surprise that “The Legend of Ochi” was made by someone (Isaiah Saxon) in this zone — an older millennial shaped by some combination of “E.T.”, “The Black Stallion” and the Palm Pictures’ Directors Label box set. Those DVDs taught many a cinephile about the transportive possibilities of music videos dreamt up by Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry for artists like Aphex Twin, Daft Punk and Björk (for whom Saxon would direct the “Wanderlust” video). That music video energy and committed world building is evident in “Ochi,” in a positive way. It’s a description that seems to be used more pejoratively than not, like shallowly dismissing something pretty as a perfume commercial. But perhaps those people just haven’t seen the good ones. Helena Zengel ( “News of the World” ) is the central heroine, Yuri, who lives with her father Maxim (Willem Dafoe) and a de-facto brother Petro (Finn Wolfhard) on the woodsy, old-world island of Carpathia. Maxim loves to hunt the Ochi, a species of primates that are constantly threatening the safety of the humans and their farms, and he’s trained an army of young boys to help. Yuri is largely kept off to the side, partly for her protection, partly, probably, because Maxim is a blustery alpha male who dresses up in elaborate, ancient armor for his missions. Her armor is a dirty, oversized yellow puffer jacket that could double as a sleeping bag. At home, she stews silently and listens to death metal in her room. She’s a bit feral, which would be a cliche trope for a girl raised without a mother, but Zengel makes it work. It’s clear she doesn’t feel at home in this world, but finds a kind of purpose when she comes across an injured baby Ochi and takes it upon herself to return it to its family. The Ochi, she quickly realizes, have been misunderstood too. It’s still a dangerous journey, which involves a humorous and slightly disgusting visit to a local supermarket, the discovery of her own long-lost mother (Emily Watson, who promptly helps Yuri brush her hair out of her eyes), and a comical, intense showdown between Watson and Dafoe. David Longstreth, of the Dirty Projectors, did the fanciful score and Evan Prosofsky is responsible for the vivid cinematography. “The Legend of Ochi” was forged out of many influences, from Miyazaki to Amblin, and it’s the kind of ambitious swing that Hollywood doesn’t seem to take very often these days — especially not with a PG rating. That doesn’t mean it all works seamlessly, though. The emotional beats don’t seem to land as authentically as the more irreverent humor. But it’s impossible not to admire the creativity, the imagination and the care that went into making something like this, with puppetry, matte paintings and inventive graphics, for a mere $10 million. “The Legend of Ochi,” an A24 release in theaters nationwide Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for “some language, smoking, a bloody image, thematic elements and violent content.” Running time: 96 minutes.

Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. Here’s what we know,https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-foreign-movies-films-8008248fc08c748a7e8a174306ba66ba,Trump has threatened a 100% tariff on movies made outside the US. Here’s what we know,"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump is eyeing Hollywood for his next round of tariffs, threatening to levy all films produced outside the U.S. at a steep rate of 100%. Over the weekend, Trump accused other countries of “stealing the movie-making capabilities” of the U.S. and said that he had authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to immediately begin the process of implementing this new import tax on all foreign-made films. But further specifics or dates weren’t provided. And the White House confirmed that no final decisions had been made as of Monday. Trump later said that he would meet with industry executives about the proposal but a lot remains unclear about how an import tax on complex, international productions could even be implemented. If imposed, experts warn that such a tariff would dramatically hike the costs of making movies today. That uncertainty could put filmmakers in limbo, much like other industries that have recently been caught in the crosshairs of today’s ongoing trade wars. Unlike other sectors that have recently been targeted by tariffs, however, movies go beyond physical goods, bringing larger intellectual property ramifications into question. Here’s what we know. Trump is citing national security concerns, a justification he’s similarly used to impose import taxes on certain countries and a range of sector-specific goods. In a Sunday night post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump claimed that the American movie industry is “DYING to a very fast death” as other countries offer “all sorts of incentives” to draw filmmaking away from the U.S. Trump has previously voiced concern about movie production moving overseas. And in recent years, U.S. film and television production has been hampered between setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Incentive programs have also long-influenced where movies are shot both abroad and within the U.S., with more production leaving California to states like Georgia and New Mexico -- as well as countries like Canada. But unlike other sectors targeted by Trump’s recently-imposed tariffs, the American film industry currently holds a trade deficit that’s in the U.S.'s favor. In movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace. Data from the Motion Picture Association also shows that American films made $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023 — with a recent report noting that these films “generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the world” for the U.S. Last year, international markets accounted for over 70% of Hollywood’s total box office revenue, notes Heeyon Kim, an assistant professor of strategy at Cornell University. She warns that tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries impacting this industry could result in billions of dollars in lost earnings and thousands of jobs. “To me, (this) makes just no sense,” she said, adding that such tariffs could “undermine otherwise a thriving part of the U.S. economy.” The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers across the U.S. and Canada, said in a statement Monday that Trump had “correctly recognized” the “urgent threat from international competition” that the American film and television industry faces today. But the union said it instead recommended the administration implement a federal production tax incentive and other provisions to “level the playing field” while not harming the industry overall. That’s anyone’s guess. “Traditional tariffs apply to physical imports crossing borders, but film production primarily involves digital services — shooting, editing and post-production work that happens electronically,” notes Ann Koppuzha, a lawyer and business law lecturer at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. Koppuzha said that film production is more like an applied service that can be taxed, not tariffed. But taxes require Congressional approval, which could be a challenge even with a Republican majority. Making a movie is also an incredibly complex — and international — process. It’s common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” for instance, are shot around the world. U.S. studios frequently shoot abroad because tax incentives can aid production costs. But a blanket tariff across the board could discourage that or limit options, Kim said — hurting both Hollywood films and the global industry that helps create them. “When you make these sort of blanket rules, you’re missing some of the nuance of how production works,” added Steven Schiffman, a longtime industry veteran and adjunct professor at Georgetown University. “Sometimes you just need to go to the location, because frankly it’s way too expensive just to try to create in a soundstage” Schiffman points to popular titles filmed outside the U.S. — such as Warner Bros’ “Harry Potter” series, which was almost entirely shot in the U.K. “The cost to have done that would have like literally double to produce those movies under this proposed tariff,” he said. Overall, experts warn that the prospect of tariffing foreign-made movies ventures into uncharted waters. “There’s simply no precedent or sense for applying tariffs to these types of creative services,” Koppuzha said. And while the Trump administration could extend similar threats to other forms of intellectual property, like music, “they’d encounter the same practical hurdles.” But if successful, some also warn of potential retaliation. Kim points to “quotas” that some countries have had to help boost their domestic films by ensuring they get a portion of theater screens, for example. Many have reduced or suspended such quotas over the years in the name of open trade — but if the U.S. places a sweeping tariff on all foreign-made films, these kinds of quotas could come back, “which would hurt Hollywood film or any of the U.S.-made intellectual property,” Kim said. And while U.S. dominance in film means “there are fewer substitutes” for retaliation, Schiffman notes that other forms of entertainment — like game development — could see related impacts down the road. Others stress the potential consequences of hampering international collaboration overall. “Creative content distribution requires thoughtful economic approaches that recognize how modern storytelling flows across borders,” notes Frank Albarella, U.S. media and telecommunications sector leader at KPMG. “The question hanging over every screen: Might we better nurture American storytelling through smart, targeted incentives, or could we inadvertently force audiences to pay more for what could become a narrower creative landscape?” __________ AP Writers Jake Coyle and Jill Colvin in New York, Aamer Madhani in Palm Beach, Florida and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",N/A
