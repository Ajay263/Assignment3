(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Trump team tries to project confidence and calm after tariff moves While his team was out defending his proposals on Sunday, Trump said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, whose production is concentrated in China. Rather, Trump said, “those products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” A week ago, Trump’s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10% universal tariff for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips. Last week on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick played up national security. “You’ve got to realize this is a national security issue,” he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the U.S. were involved in a war. On Sunday, Lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle. “The world cheats us. They’ve been cheating us for decades,” Navarro said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to U.S. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets. Read more. Of note: With the higher rates set to be collected beginning April 9, administration officials argued last week that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. On Sunday, Navarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials. Greer said on CBS that his goal was “to get meaningful deals before 90 days” – the duration of Trump’s pause – “and I think we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.” Related reads ➤ Thune's 'old fashioned' approach to Senate has kept Trump on board so far The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace. It wasn’t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and — importantly for Thune — the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years. At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune said his message in conversations with the president was, “Let us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we’ll see where we go from there.” Read more. Of note: That approach has been successful so far, allowing the South Dakota Republican to show Trump the Senate’s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president’s Cabinet. Related reads ➤ What might El Salvador’s Bukele get by visiting Trump? Trump is hosting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a lynchpin of the U.S. administration's mass deportation operation. Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. More than 200 Venezuelan immigrants – whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes — and placed them inside the country's notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It is also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so. That has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country’s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported. Read more. Of note: Since Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit in February, Bukele — whose government has arrested more than 84,000 people as part of his three-year crackdown on gangs — has made it clear he’s ready to help the Trump administration with its deportation ambitions. Bukele struck a deal under which the U.S. will pay about $6 million for El Salvador to imprison the Venezuelan immigrants for a year. When a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn around a flight carrying the immigrants already en route to El Salvador, Bukele wrote on social media: “Oopsie ... too late.""

Trump says only 21 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza now believed to be alive,https://apnews.com/article/trump-hamas-gaza-israel-hostages-netanyahu-7848cad17dd47baaf21d171f3f5ea40d,Trump says only 21 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza now believed to be alive,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that three hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have died, leaving only 21 believed to be still living. “As of today, it’s 21, three have died,” Trump said of the hostages being held by Hamas, noting until recently it had been 24 people believed to be living. He did not elaborate on the identities of those now believed to be dead, nor how he had come to learn of their deaths. “There’s 21, plus a lot of dead bodies,” Trump said. One American, Edan Alexander, had been among the 24 hostages believed to be alive, with the bodies of several other Americans also held by Hamas after its Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel. The president’s comments came as Israel approved plans Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, in a bid to recover the hostages and try to fulfill its war aims of destroying Hamas. If implemented, the move would vastly expand Israel’s operations there and likely draw fierce international opposition. Separately, the State Department said Tuesday that the U.S. embassy helped 17 U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents leave Gaza on Monday. “We thank our partners in the Israeli and Jordanian governments who made this departure possible,” the department said.

Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy is a driving force on the world stage,https://apnews.com/article/trump-transactional-diplomacy-tariffs-russia-ukraine-canada-e70f0e800b1c7891a0fa4f21a28c67af,Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy is a driving force on the world stage,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It’s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top. The tactics are clear in his brewing trade war with Canada and Mexico, in his approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine and in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term. “President Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,” retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the president’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week. For Trump, it’s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft. It’s not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump’s actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe. He’s shaping a foreign policy that’s more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development as dubious and riddled by waste and suggesting that the United States might not defend fellow NATO members that aren’t meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance. Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world. The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what’s-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe. Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump’s “ledger” approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy. Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, “Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing.” “But diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,” Frantz said. “Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.” Trump on Thursday told reporters that he has decided to make Saudi Arabia the first overseas visit of his new term because the oil-rich kingdom has agreed to make a huge investment in the United States over the next four years. “They’ve gotten richer, we’ve all gotten older. So I said, ’I’ll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies,’” Trump said. He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment. Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America’s oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks. In his dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has “the cards” and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly. Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded. Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was “regrettable.” He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. — even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians — that Trump wants. In his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy’s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials. But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia. “I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don’t have the cards,” Trump said. “In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.” Trump’s push on Zelenskyy — and pivot toward Moscow — marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War. Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden’s approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement. At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration. Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, halted offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command and disbanded a program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion. Kellogg, who also served in Trump’s first White House, recalled seeing Trump’s “transactional diplomacy approach” early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president’s first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same. “As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, ’What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?’'' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event. The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico. Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war. He then postponed most of them. The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs. “Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,” Trump said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America’s 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump’s trade war. The episode has underscored Trump’s willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world’s most durable and amicable alliances. The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump’s move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary. “It’s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,” Trudeau said. “But Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.” ___ AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",N/A
Top US officials will meet with Chinese delegation in Switzerland in first major talks of trade war,https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-trade-switzerland-bessent-2a3335ed92989dc4b3a74ea550b79b3f,Top US officials will meet with Chinese delegation in Switzerland in first major talks of trade war,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Donald Trump sparked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their counterparts in Geneva in the most-senior known conversations between the two countries in months, the Trump administration announced Tuesday. It comes amid growing U.S. market worry over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods. No country has been hit harder by Trump’s trade war than China, the world’s biggest exporter and second largest economy. When Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, a move that Trump viewed as demonstrating a lack of respect. The tariffs on each other’s goods have been mounting since then, with the U.S. tariffs against China now at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%. American firms have already begun canceling orders from China, postponing expansion plans and hunkering down as a result of the tariff war. After plans for the talks had been announced, Bessent said on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” that as the U.S. has engaged in negotiations with various trading partners, “China has been the missing piece.” The current situation, he said, “isn’t sustainable ... especially on the Chinese side.” He added that current high tariff levels were “the equivalent of an embargo. We don’t want to decouple. What we want is fair trade.” Trump had claimed previously that the U.S. and China were holding negotiations on lowering tariffs, which Beijing has denied, saying Trump must first lower his stiff tariffs. The Chinese Commerce Ministry on Tuesday confirmed the meeting between its vice premier and Bessent in Switzerland. “The Chinese side carefully evaluated the information from the U.S. side and decided to agree to have contact with the U.S. side after fully considering global expectations, Chinese interests and calls from U.S. businesses and consumers,” said a ministry spokesperson. The spokesperson said China would not “sacrifice its principles or global equity or justice in seeking any agreement.” Most economists have said the cost of the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. And the higher prices are already becoming a burden on U.S. consumers, who are in the biggest economic funk since the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, economists say the risk of a recession is growing. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official and now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the upcoming meeting is a welcome development. “As the first face to face meeting between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since Trump’s inauguration, it’s an important opportunity to have initial talks on unwinding some tariffs, mapping out a path forward, as well as raising concerns,” Cutler said. “We should not expect any quick victories — this will be a process that will take time.” In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, according to readouts from their respective offices. Both Greer and Bessent had talked with their counterparts before the beginning of the trade war. Greer told Fox News Channel last month that he spoke with his Chinese counterpart for over an hour before the trade war started. “I thought it was constructive,” he said, adding: “This is not a plan just to encircle China. It’s a plan to fix the American economy, to have a greater share of manufacturing as GDP, to have real wages go up, to be producing things instead of having an economy that’s financed by the government.” And Bessent in February spoke with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng “to exchange views on the bilateral economic relationship,” according to a Treasury news release. ___ Associated Press writer Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.",N/A
Senate confirms Bisignano to lead Social Security Administration as agency faces DOGE overhaul,https://apnews.com/article/social-security-administration-bisignano-trump-doge-7ec043009064a58be57ce1465dec0481,Senate confirms Bisignano to lead Social Security Administration as agency faces DOGE overhaul,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Wall Street veteran Frank Bisignano was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday to lead the Social Security Administration, taking over at a turbulent time for the agency that provides benefits to more than 70 million Americans. The Senate confirmed Bisignano in a 53-47 vote. Bisignano’s confirmation comes after a months-long series of announcements at the Social Security Administration of mass federal worker layoffs, cuts to programs, office closures and a planned cut to nationwide Social Security phone services, which were eventually walked back. Many of the changes are driven by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, headed by billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who said this week that he is preparing to wind down his role with the administration. The upheaval has made Social Security a major focus of Democrats, including former President Joe Biden, who said in his first public speech since leaving office that Republican President Donald Trump has “taken a hatchet” to the program. Bisignano, a self-professed “DOGE person,” has served as chair of Fiserv, a payments and financial services tech firm since 2020. He is a one-time defender of corporate policies to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. Bisignano takes over from the agency’s acting commissioner, DOGE supporter Leland Dudek. Bisignano’s term ends in January 2031. Asked during his March confirmation hearing whether Social Security should be privatized, Bisignano responded: “I’ve never heard a word of it, and I’ve never thought about it.” Democrats and activists have for weeks railed against Bisignano’s confirmation, holding rallies and other events protesting his nomination. During the final roll call vote, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden called Bisignano “unfit” to be the steward of Americans’ Social Security benefits. Wyden said Trump wants Bisignano to “gut” Social security, and that Republicans who support Bisignano’s confirmation would be to responsible if their grandmother misses a Social Security check and can’t pay rent. “By confirming Mr. Bisignano, the Senate will be signing a death sentence to Social Security as we know it today,” Wyden said. The chaos at the the agency began shortly after acting commissioner Michelle King stepped down in February, a move that came after DOGE sought access to Social Security recipient information. That prompted a lawsuit by labor unions and retirees, who asked a federal court to issue an emergency order limiting DOGE’s access to Social Security data. Most recently, the full panel of judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 9-6 not to lift restrictions on the access that DOGE has to Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans. Also in February, the agency announced plans to cut 7,000 people from the agency payroll through layoffs, employee reassignments and an offer of voluntary separation agreements, as part of an intensified effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce. Dudek also announced a plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices. That sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population. That plan has since been rolled back. The SSA provides benefits to roughly 72.5 million people, including retirees and children.",N/A
Canada’s Carney becomes the latest foreign leader to get the Trump treatment in the Oval Office,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mark-carney-oval-office-a6a9118ea26692c9658fde5c7355ce39,Canada’s Carney becomes the latest foreign leader to get the Trump treatment in the Oval Office,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A meeting between the leaders of Canada and the United States is not usually considered a high-stakes showdown, but there was little ordinary about this one. Here was newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney making his first visit to the Oval Office to see President Donald Trump, who has spent months musing about turning America’s northern neighbor into the 51st state. It didn’t take long for a reporter to ask about what was on everyone’s mind. Trump said he was still interested in annexing Canada, describing the border between the two countries as nothing more than an arbitrary line. Carney’s campaign was fueled by a wave of anger at Trump’s aggressive rhetoric, and now was his chance to defend his country to the president’s face. He was polite and firm. “Some places are never for sale,” Carney said. Canada is one of them, he added, and “it won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump gave a little shrug and raised his eyebrows. “Never say never,” he responded. Carney mouthed the words “never, never, never.” The interaction offered a glimpse into how Trump has transformed Oval Office meetings from brief and bland encounters into precarious affairs that often force foreign leaders to choose between placating or confronting the American president. His approach can be thrilling for supporters and destabilizing for diplomats accustomed to a more deliberative approach to international relations. “There is no formula for dealing with this,” said Daniel Mulhall, who was Ireland’s ambassador to the U.S. during Trump’s first term. He described the president’s unpredictable behavior as a “risk factor” and “an extraordinary departure from the norm.” It appears that Carney struck the right balance, at least in Trump’s mind. As the meeting ended, the president said, “I like this guy.” Carney grinned. An invitation to the Oval Office has long been the height of international prestige, but the meetings were rarely dramatic. Journalists were ushered into the room to take pictures and, if they were lucky, ask a couple of questions while leaders made perfunctory remarks. Now, they’re raucous episodes in a foreign policy reality show, starring Trump. While the president can be a gracious host, he openly complains about visitors’ countries — their trade policies, their lack of defense spending, their perceived ingratitude. He’s also willing to take question upon question on a range of topics from reporters, turning guests into silent spectators. Sixteen foreign leaders have visited the White House since Trump returned to office, outpacing Barack Obama and Joe Biden at similar points in their presidencies. “Thanks to this president’s commitment to transparency and accessibility, Americans can watch his foreign policy agenda play out in real time — presenting an opportunity for both foreign leaders and the president to convey their message to the American people,” said a statement from Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary. The meetings sometimes become endurance tests. On Tuesday, Carney listened to Trump criticize California’s delayed high-speed rail project, boast about upgrading the Oval Office with “great love and 24-karat gold” and make a surprise announcement that the U.S. would stop bombing the Houthis in Yemen. Trump also went on an extended tangent about Obama’s plans for his presidential library in Chicago, claiming that there are delays because his predecessor “only wants woke people to build it.” “He wanted to be very politically correct, and he didn’t use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers,” Trump claimed. As time dragged on, Carney’s lips tightened, his mouth twitched and his eyes darted around the room. He kept his hands clasped in front of him, except for largely futile gestures as he tried to get a word in. El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele was more at ease during his own meeting with Trump. He grinned as Trump bragged about getting “the highest mark” on his latest cognitive test, criticized a reporter’s “low ratings” and declared himself “very flexible” on tariffs. Elise Labott, a longtime journalist who is now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, dismissed the White House’s characterization of the encounters as evidence of the president being transparent. “It’s just another part of the show,” she said. Oval Office meetings, she added, have been “hijacked for part of the circus.” Foreign leaders often walk a careful line to avoid publicly confronting Trump, and they often rely on quick pivots when difficult subjects arise. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in the Oval Office while Trump talked about annexing Greenland — which is the territory of Denmark, another NATO ally. Rutte said, “I don’t want to drag NATO in that” and quickly shifted to an area of agreement. When it comes to the issue of security in the Arctic, Rutte told Trump, “you are totally right.” Jordanian King Abdullah II squirmed through a meeting where Trump explained his idea for the United States to take over Gaza and expel Palestinians from their homes. It’s among the most sensitive issues for Abdullah, whose country is home to more than two million Palestinian refugees, and he sidestepped questions about Trump’s proposal. It wasn’t until after the meeting that he posted about his opposition to Trump’s idea on social media. French President Emmanuel Macron was the rare leader to correct Trump without facing a backlash. When the U.S. leader claimed that Europe was lending Ukraine money — instead of donating it outright — Macron gently placed his left hand on Trump’s right forearm to interject. Trump rolled with it. “If you believe that, it’s OK with me,” he told reporters. No meeting has gone as poorly as Trump’s sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. After a heated exchange over the best way to end the war with Russia, Trump told him, “It’s going to be very hard to do business like this.” “You have to be thankful,” Trump told Zelenskyy. “You don’t have the cards.” As journalists left the room, Trump added, “This is going to be great television.” Rufus Gifford, former chief of protocol for Biden, said Trump was successful at little more than getting attention for himself. “Donald Trump has an ability to have eyeballs on him. That is, without a doubt, impressive,” he said. “But just because he’s able to get people to watch him doesn’t mean the strategy is smart or good for the United States of America.” Max Bergmann, a former State Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the meetings are “always going to be really challenging because the president can be volatile.” “It will give a lot of diplomats around the world pause about whether they want to schedule a meeting,” he said. But a meeting with Trump is a hard thing to avoid, especially for American allies. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer prepped intensively for his first encounter with Trump, understanding that the president prizes personal relationships and it’s hard to recover if he dislikes you. Starmer handed the president a written invitation from King Charles III for a state visit and praised him for returning a bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office. He also thanked Trump for changing the conversation on Ukraine — even though he did that by siding more with Russia than European allies want.

The two kept it civil, but as for Trump’s calls to make Canada the 51st state, Carney insisted his nation was “not for sale” and Trump shot back, “time will tell.” Asked by a reporter if there was anything Carney could tell him to lift his tariffs of as much as 25% on Canada, Trump bluntly said: “No.” President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The U.S. president added for emphasis, “Just the way it is.” Carney acknowledged that no bit of rhetoric on tariffs would be enough to sway Trump, saying that “this is a bigger discussion.” “There are much bigger forces involved,” the Canadian leader continued. “And this will take some time and some discussions. And that’s why we’re here, to have those discussions.” The meeting between the two leaders showcased the full spectrum of Trump’s unique mix of aggression, hospitality and stubbornness. Shortly before Carney’s arrival, Trump insulted Canada by posting on social media that the United States didn’t need “ANYTHING” from its northern neighbor, only to then turn on the charm and praise Carney’s election win in person before showing his obstinance on matters of policy substance. Carney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump, even as he has preserved the calm demeanor of an economist who has led the central banks of both Canada and the United Kingdom. At times, Carney struggled to interject his views and raised his hand to talk as Trump held forth at length and veered between topics, touching on California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, and teasing a “great” upcoming announcement that’s “not necessarily on trade.” Trump offended Canada’s sense of pride and friendship by saying he wants to make Canada the 51st U.S. state and levying steep tariffs against an essential partner in the manufacturing of autos and the supply of oil, electricity and other goods. The outrage provoked by Trump enabled Carney’s Liberal Party to score a stunning comeback victory last month as the trade war and attacks on Canadian sovereignty have outraged voters. Trump said the two would not discuss making Canada part of the U.S., even as he insisted the idea would lead to lower taxes for Canadians. “It’s not for sale,” Carney said. “It won’t be for sale. Ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.” Trump persisted by saying that the United States did not want to buy autos from Canada, even if the vehicles were also assembled in America. The U.S. leader insisted that the $63 billion trade deficit in goods — which he inflated to $200 billion — was a subsidy that needed to come an end. The meeting never devolved into the outburst that the public saw in Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was berated by the U.S. president and his team for not being sufficiently deferential. Nor did it have the ease of Trump’s sit down with the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who invited Trump for a visit provided by King Charles III. Carney later described his conversation with Trump as “wide ranging” and “constructive,” telling reporters that the prospect is there for positive negotiations but there would be “zigs and zags.” Carney said he stressed the value that Canadian companies and factories created for U.S. automakers while stressing that it was unfair to assume one meeting could resolve any differences. “I wouldn’t have expected white smoke coming out of this meeting,” Carney said after the Tuesday meeting, referencing the signal that a new pope has been selected. Carney said that he privately asked Trump to stop calling Canada the 51st state during their meeting. But when pressed on how Trump responded, the Canadian prime minister said: “He’s the president. He’s his own person.” Trump was later asked if he would give Carney the same “governor” nickname that he had put on Trudeau. The nickname was a slight meant to imply that Canada’s leader would eventually be just one of many U.S. governors. “As far as calling him Gov. Carney, no, I haven’t done that yet, and maybe I won’t,” Trump said. “I did have a lot of fun with Trudeau. But I think this is, this is a big step. It’s a good step up for Canada.” Trump added that the meeting with Carney had been “great” and that he thought the ongoing relationship would be “strong.” A senior Canadian government official said the president asked Carney his perspective on a variety of foreign policy issues including Iran, Russia, Ukraine and China. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said Trump was looking forward to the G-7 meeting in Alberta, Canada. The stakes of the meeting were high and the messages beforehand mixed. Trump told reporters on Monday that he wasn’t quite sure why Carney was visiting. “I’m not sure what he wants to see me about,” Trump said. “But I guess he wants to make a deal.” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick further stoked doubts about their interest in repairing the relationship with Canada in a Monday interview on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Asked if the U.S. could make a deal with Canada, Lutnick called the country a “socialist regime” that has been “basically feeding off America.” Lutnick said Tuesday’s meeting would be “fascinating.” Carney, at a Friday news conference ahead of his trip, said the talks would focus on immediate trade pressures and the broader economic and national security relationships. He said his “government would fight to get the best deal for Canada” and “take all the time necessary” to do so, even as Canada pursues a parallel set of talks to deepen relations with other allies and lessen its commitments with the U.S. President Donald Trump greets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House, Tuesday, May 6, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump has maintained that the U.S. doesn’t need anything from Canada. He is actively going after a Canadian auto sector built largely by U.S. companies, saying, “They’re stopping work in Mexico, and they’re stopping work in Canada, and they’re all moving here.” He also said the U.S. doesn’t need Canada’s energy — though nearly one-fourth of the oil that the U.S. consumes daily comes from the province of Alberta. The president has also disparaged Canada’s military commitments despite a partnership that ranges from the beaches of Normandy in World War II to remote stretches of Afghanistan. He said on Tuesday with Carney that the U.S. would continue to provide national security support to Canada. Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and tariffs on other products outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in some cases ostensibly to address relatively low volumes of fentanyl intercepted at the northern border. That has jeopardized a closely entwined trade relationship as Canada sees an increasing need to build relations with the European Union and other nations. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.",N/A
"Supreme Court allows Trump ban on transgender members of the military to take effect, for now",https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-transgender-military-ban-ef67038857bd5b99e128bf0b8866afb4,"Supreme Court allows Trump ban on transgender members of the military to take effect, for now","▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a ban on transgender people in the military, while legal challenges proceed. The court acted in the dispute over a policy that presumptively disqualifies transgender people from military service and could lead to the expulsion of experienced, decorated officers. The court’s three liberal justices said they would have kept the policy on hold. Neither the justices in the majority or dissent explained their votes, which is not uncommon in emergency appeals. Just after beginning his second term in January, Trump moved aggressively to roll back the rights of transgender people. Among the Republican president’s actions was an executive order that claims the sexual identity of transgender service members “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life” and is harmful to military readiness. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the Supreme Court has acted to allow a transgender military service ban, for the time being. In response, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy in February that gave the military services 30 days to figure out how they would seek out and identify transgender service members to remove them from the force. Those actions had been stalled by the lawsuits. “No More Trans @ DoD,” Hegseth wrote in a post on X following Tuesday’s Supreme Court order. Earlier in the day, before the court acted, Hegseth said that his department is leaving wokeness and weakness behind. “No more pronouns,” he told a special operations forces conference in Tampa. “No more dudes in dresses. We’re done with that s—-.” The Defense Department said Tuesday that officials are currently determining the next steps, but officials were not aware of any actions being taken right away. Three federal judges had ruled against the ban. In the case the justices acted on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Benjamin Settle in Tacoma, Washington, had ruled for seven long-serving transgender military members who say that the ban is insulting and discriminatory and that their firing would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations. A prospective service member also sued. The individual service members who challenged the ban together have amassed more than 70 medals in 115 years of service, their lawyers wrote. The lead plaintiff is Emily Shilling, a Navy commander with nearly 20 years of service, including as a combat pilot who flew 60 missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The Trump administration offered no explanation as to why transgender troops, who have been able to serve openly over the past four years with no evidence of problems, should suddenly be banned, Settle wrote. The judge is an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and is a former captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps. Settle imposed a nationwide hold on the policy and a federal appeals court rejected the administration’s emergency plea. The Justice Department then turned to the Supreme Court. The policy also has been blocked by a federal judge in the nation’s capital, but that ruling has been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court, which heard arguments last month. The three-judge panel, which includes two judges appointed by Trump during his first term, appeared to be in favor of the administration’s position. In a more limited ruling, a judge in New Jersey also has barred the Air Force from removing two transgender men, saying they showed their separation would cause lasting damage to their careers and reputations that no monetary settlement could repair. The LGBTQ rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation called the high court order a devastating blow to dedicated and highly qualified service members. “By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice. Transgender individuals meet the same standards and demonstrate the same values as all who serve. We remain steadfast in our belief that this ban violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and will ultimately be struck down,” the groups said in a statement. The federal appeals court in San Francisco will hear the administration’s appeal in a process that will play out over several months at least. All the while, though, the transgender ban will remain in place under the Supreme Court order. In 2016, during Barack Obama’s presidency, a Defense Department policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. During Trump’s first term in the White House, the Republican issued a directive to ban transgender service members, with an exception for some of those who had already started transitioning under more lenient rules that were in effect during Obama’s Democratic administration. The Supreme Court allowed that ban to take effect. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped it when he took office. The rules the Defense Department wants to enforce contain no exceptions. The policy during Trump’s first term and the new one are “materially indistinguishable,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the justices, though lawyers for the service members who sued disagreed. Thousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the 2.1 million troops serving. A senior defense official said in February that they believe there are about 4,200 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria currently serving in the active duty, National Guard and Reserves. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues, said that between 2015 and 2024, the total cost for psychotherapy, gender-affirming hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgery and other treatment for service members is about $52 million. ___ Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board is unexpectedly removed from position,https://apnews.com/article/ntsb-vice-chair-removed-66319c7d69f248a9cbaf012845211922,Vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board is unexpectedly removed from position,"The vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board has been abruptly removed from his position, the White House confirmed Tuesday, a rare move that comes as the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters juggles more than 1,000 cases. The Trump administration removed Alvin Brown a little more than a year after he was sworn in for a term that was expected to end in 2026. The White House didn’t say why he was removed and Brown has not publicly commented. The decision comes as NTSB investigates nearly 1,250 active cases across the U.S., while supporting more than 160 foreign investigations, according to March testimony by NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. The investigations include the deadly midair collision between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people in January and the medical transport plane that plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood that same month, killing eight people. It’s also investigating the catastrophic collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge in March 2024, which killed six construction workers. Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, said he has never seen an administration remove a member of the board. Board members have been known to stay on after their term is over if the administration hasn’t appointed anyone yet and then they leave once the next administration selects someone else, he said. “That happens a lot over the years, but that’s normal and expected because you served your term and now it’s time for someone else to serve in there,” he said. “But this wasn’t that. This was just more abrupt and directly from the administration, and I don’t know what the impetus is.” By Tuesday evening, Brown’s photo and biography had already been removed from NTSB’s website. The agency includes five board members who serve five year terms, according to the NTSB website. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The chairman and vice chairman are both designated by the president and serve for three years. By Tuesday evening, the website only showed four members of the board. Brown was sworn in as a member of the board in April 2024 after being nominated by then-President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to fill one of two vacancies. His term was expected to run through 2026, according to an NTSB press release at the time. He was the only Black member of the board. He was the mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, from 2011 to 2015 and joined the board after serving as senior adviser for community infrastructure opportunities for the U.S. Department of Transportation, according to the release. The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators. It typically works on about 2,200 domestic and 450 foreign cases each year, according to Homendy. She said she expects “the number of cases annually to remain high and continue to increase in complexity.” The agency has been excluded from the deferred resignation program and probationary employee cuts to downsize the federal workforce. Homendy often presents NTSB as a lean agency “that plays a vital role in ensuring public safety and protection of life and property,” although she did ask for modest budget increases last year and this year. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed to this report.",N/A
Lawmakers seek to rein in citizen ballot initiatives with new requirements for petitions,https://apnews.com/article/citizen-ballot-initiative-petition-2be9e9c2900d17d93ac588b136039d56,Lawmakers seek to rein in citizen ballot initiatives with new requirements for petitions,"Citizen activists supporting a public vote on important issues could have to brush up on their reading, writing and arithmetic if they want to get their initiatives on next year’s ballot in some states. A new Arkansas law will bar initiative ballot titles written above an eighth-grade reading level. And canvassers will have to verify that petition signers have either read the ballot title or had it read aloud to them. In South Dakota, sponsors will need to make sure their petition titles appears in 14-point type on the front page and 16-point font on the back, where people typically sign. And in Florida, volunteers will have to register with the state if they gather more than 25 petition signatures from outside their family or risk facing felony charges punishable by up to five years in prison. Across about dozen states, roughly 40 bills restricting or revamping the citizen initiative process have passed at least one legislative chamber this year, according to a review by The Associated Press. Many already have been signed into law. Some advocates for the initiative process are alarmed by the trend. “Globally, as there’s movements to expand direct democracy. In the United States it’s contracting,” said Dane Waters, chair of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California, who has advised ballot campaigns in over 20 nations. Most of the new restrictions come from Republican lawmakers in states where petitions have been used to place abortion rights, marijuana legalization and other progressive initiatives on the ballot. GOP lawmakers contend their measures are shielding state constitutions from outside interests. “This is not a bill to restrict. It is a bill to protect — to make sure that our constitutional system is one of integrity, and that it’s free of fraud,” said state Sen. Jennifer Bradley of Florida, where the new initiative requirements already have been challenged in court. About half the U.S. states allow people to bypass their legislatures by gathering signatures to place proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot. Since Oregon voters first used the process in 1904, a total of 2,744 citizen initiatives have appeared on statewide ballots, with 42% wining approval, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute. But the process has long caused tension between voters and their elected representatives. Lawmakers often perceive the initiative process as “an assault on their power and authority, and they want to limit it,” Waters said. “They view it, in my opinion, as a nuisance – a gnat that keeps bothering them.” Because initiative petitions require thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, groups sponsoring them often pay people to solicit signatures outside shopping centers and public places. Some states now prohibit payments based on the number of signatures gathered. States also are trying to restrict who can circulate petitions. A new Arkansas law requires paid petition canvassers to live in the state. And a new Montana law will make petition circulators wear badges displaying their name and home state. The new Florida law expanding registration requirements for petition circulators also requires them to undergo state training and bars canvassers who are noncitizens, nonresidents or felons without their voting rights restored. In addition to providing their name, address and birth date, people signing initiative petitions in Florida also will have to provide either their Florida driver’s license, state identification card or the last four digits of their Social Security number. That information is not required in other states, said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that has backed dozens of ballot initiatives in states. Hall said people concerned about privacy might hesitate to sign petitions. “I work in ballot measures, and I deeply support many of the things that folks have tried to put on the ballot in Florida, ” Hall said, “and I don’t know if I could bring myself to do that – that’s a very prohibitive requirement.” Many states already prescribe a particular format for initiative petitions. South Dakota’s new mandate for specific font sizes was prompted by allegations that some people got duped into signing a petition for abortion rights last year, said sponsoring state Sen. Amber Hulse, a Republican. Printing the ballot title in large type “might make it harder for some issues to get on the ballot if people know what they’re signing. But that’s actually a good thing,” Hulse said. Before they can collect signatures, petition sponsors must get approval from state officials. New measures in several states give those officials greater authority. New Arkansas laws allow the attorney general to reject initiatives written above an eighth-grade reading level or which conflict with the U.S. Constitution or federal law. Utah’s lieutenant governor, who already can reject unconstitutional petitions, now also will be able to turn away petitions that are unlikely to provide adequate funding for their proposed laws. A new Missouri law gives greater power to the secretary of state, instead of judges, to rewrite ballot summaries struck down as being insufficient or unfair. Most states require only a majority vote to amend their constitutions, though Colorado requires 55% approval and Florida 60%. Republican-led legislatures in North Dakota and South Dakota approved measures this year proposing a 60% public vote to approve future constitutional amendments, and Utah lawmakers backed a 60% threshold for tax measures. All three propositions still must go before voters, where they will need only a majority to pass. Voters rejected similar proposals in Ohio, Arkansas and South Dakota in recent years, but they approved a 60% threshold for tax measures in Arizona. Lawmakers contend the move has merit. “Raising the threshold can help protect the constitution from being manipulated by special interest groups or out-of-state activists,” North Dakota House Majority Leader Mike Lefor said earlier this year. ___ Associated Press writers Jack Dura and Kate Payne contributed to this report. ___ Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP) — Alabama lawmakers on Tuesday voted to cut the state sales tax on food and to exempt diapers, baby formula and menstrual hygiene products from the state sales tax altogether. The Alabama Senate approved both bills by votes of 34-0. The bills now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. The food tax reduction comes as lawmakers in both parties said families are being hurt by soaring grocery prices. The reduction, if signed into law, will lower the state sales tax on food from 3% to 2% beginning Sept. 1. Lawmakers in 2023 reduced the tax from 4% to 3%. An additional reduction to 2% was planned but hinged on budget growth that did not materialize. “We’re still one of a few states that taxes groceries. We’re headed toward zero taxes, we’re headed in the right direction. This is big,” Republican Rep. Danny Garrett, the sponsor of the bill, said. The reduction will cost the state about $121 million annually in tax revenue that would otherwise goes to the Education Trust Fund. The leader of Alabama Arise, an advocacy group that supports policies that help low-income families, said the grocery tax belongs in the “dustbin of history.” “The grocery tax drives many families deeper into poverty, and Arise remains committed to the goal of eliminating it entirely,” Alabama Arise Executive Director Robyn Hyden said. Lawmakers also approved a bill that will exempt baby formula, maternity clothing, diapers and menstrual hygiene products from state sales tax. Baby wipes, breast pumps and bottles would also be exempt. The exemption from the 4% sales tax will cost the state about $13 million annually. “This is a big win for Alabama’s working families,” Democratic Rep. Neil Rafferty, the sponsor of the bill, wrote on social media about the approval.",N/A
A man with an open asylum case was deported. His lawyers want to know if there are others,https://apnews.com/article/trump-deportation-settlement-el-salvador-77475d1e00b7e12ee2950e97df869d60,A man with an open asylum case was deported. His lawyers want to know if there are others,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become a household name as the Trump administration is engaged in an intense legal campaign to keep him locked up in an El Salvador prison despite his mistaken deportation. But his case isn’t the only one of its kind inching through the U.S. court system. Nearly two months have passed since a 20-year-old Venezuelan native, known only as Cristian in court filings, was deported to El Salvador despite having a pending asylum application. Now his lawyers want to know if there are others like him. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher stopped short of ordering the Trump administration to produce a list of any others who are in the same legal situation as Cristian. But the judge made it clear during a hearing Tuesday that she won’t second-guess her earlier order for the Trump administration to facilitate Cristian’s return to the U.S. Gallagher, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, said it is a “fair inference” that the administration has done nothing to comply with her April 23 decision. She gave the government until Thursday to appeal her ruling before she considers ordering specific steps to comply with the order. Gallagher said the case isn’t about whether Cristian is entitled to asylum if he is able to return to the U.S. “The issue is and always has been one of process,” the judge said. “People are entitled to that.” Abrego Garcia and Cristian both were deported on March 15. Dozens of other people were flown from the U.S. to El Salvador after Trump issued a proclamation calling for the arrest and removal of Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law. Cristian had been transferred into federal custody from a jail in Harris County, Texas, in January. Abrego Garcia was arrested in Maryland, where he lived with his wife — a U.S. citizen — and their children. Unlike Cristian, Abrego Garcia is a native of El Salvador. A U.S. immigration judge’s order in 2019 protected him from being sent there because he likely faced persecution by local Salvadoran gangs that terrorized him and his family. Gallagher ruled that the government violated a 2019 settlement agreement when it deported Cristian. She said she was guided by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis’ ruling that Trump’s Republican administration must facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. “Standing by and taking no action is not facilitation,” Gallagher wrote. “In prior cases involving wrongfully removed individuals, courts have ordered, and the government has taken, affirmative steps toward facilitating return.” Gallagher said her order requires the government to make “a good faith request” for the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody. Xinis, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. The judge set May deadlines this month for administration officials to testify under oath about what they have done to comply. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys said the administration was moving toward bringing him back when it asked for a pause in the court case last month. “We agreed to that request because we understood it to be made in good faith,” the lawyers said in a news release. “Unfortunately, one week later, it remains unclear what, if anything, the government has done in the past seven days to bring our client home to his family.” The Justice Department is likely to appeal Gallagher’s rulings in Cristian’s favor. Any appeal would be heard by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the meantime, Gallagher refused Tuesday to suspend her April 23 decision. The judge scheduled Tuesday’s hearing to find out what, if anything, the government has done to comply with her order to facilitate Cristian’s return. Justice Department attorney Richard Ingebretsen merely told her that the State Department was notified of her ruling. “That is the extent of the information,” Ingebretsen added. One of Cristian’s attorneys, Kevin DeJong, dismissed that response as a “non-answer” and expressed concern that the administration is trying to avoid complying with the judge’s order. Ingebretsen said immigration officials have determined that Cristian isn’t entitled to asylum. But the man’s lawyers said he has a right to get a ruling on the merits of his asylum application by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Meanwhile, Cristian’s lawyers want to know if the U.S. has deported other people who are covered by the same settlement that benefited him. “There may well be other class members removed and we don’t know about it,” DeJong said. “It’s not acceptable.”",N/A
Judge expresses sympathy for fired federal workers but questions if reinstatement is proper remedy,https://apnews.com/article/trump-federal-workers-fired-court-b54674c187fbe9a9d07555ee7ce9b3a6,Judge expresses sympathy for fired federal workers but questions if reinstatement is proper remedy,"A federal judge expressed sympathy on Tuesday for thousands of federal employees who were suddenly fired by the Trump administration earlier this year, but he also voiced skepticism about whether reinstating them to their jobs was a proper remedy and questioned what the courts could ultimately do. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson made the comments during a hearing in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, as part of a lawsuit brought by 19 states and the District of Columbia. The suit alleges the states were harmed by the mass firings of probationary workers, because states did not have warnings required by law to help them prepare for the unemployed. “Part of me thinks that the voters may be the ones to render a final verdict on this,” Wilkinson said. “There are limits to what the courts can do, but there are also gigantic political costs to throwing out so many employees, and in one sense the final verdict may be one for the voters to render. I’m not saying that’s the whole answer, but maybe it’s a part of it.” While a federal judge in Baltimore issued an order in March to require the federal government to reinstate the employees, the federal appeals court halted it. The states are seeking further review as the lawsuit plays out, but Wilkinson said full reinstatement of the employees sounded like an overly broad remedy during Tuesday’s hearing. Caroline Van Zile, the solicitor general of the District of Columbia, argued that the District of Columbia and states have been harmed due to the lack of 60 days’ notice and information about layoffs required in the law when the federal government conducts a reduction in force. The time and information was set by Congress to help states respond, she said. “They have made us the ones responding to unemployment crises like this, not the federal government — the states,” Van Zile said. “We are the ones left holding the bags by statute, and that’s exactly why they gave us this right to information.” But Sarah Welch, an attorney for the appellants, said information has been provided, and she also contended that the probationary employees in question were not dismissed due to what’s known as a reduction in force, which triggers the 60-day warning and information requirements that the states say they did not receive. “These agencies did not conduct (reductions in force.) They haven’t eliminated positions, and there’s been not a shred of evidence that agencies through the terminations of probationary employees that are challenged here have eliminated a single position or changed their agency functions, which would be the calling cards of a RIF,” Welch said. Probationary workers have been targeted for layoffs across the federal government because they’re usually new to the job and lack full civil service protection. While expressing sympathy for the workers, Wilkinson said “there seems to be a disconnect between the harm alleged and the remedy imposed.” “The remedy has to be tailored to the violation, and here the remedy is very broad, and much broader than the actual violation, and as just as a basic matter of equity, that’s a difficult proposition,” the judge said. But Van Zile said she believed U.S. District Judge James Bredar got it right in his order, when he said that agencies can’t engage in far-reaching illegal activity “and then complain that the remedy is too burdensome.” “They are the ones who terminated 24,000 employees in a single go,” Van Zile said. “That harm was wrought on the states. We had no agency, no way to avoid that harm.” Bredar was one of two judges appointed by Democratic presidents who found that the Trump administration violated federal laws in carrying out the terminations at 20 agencies in the states that sued. The Supreme Court blocked another order from U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, finding that nonprofit groups lacked legal standing to sue over the firing of probationary workers. During Tuesday’s hearing, Wilkinson also questioned whether reinstating the employees would give states too much influence over the composition of the federal workforce. While the judge said he has sympathy for how individuals have been affected, “there’s a real question here of what the federal remedy could be that wouldn’t really significantly damage the federal government’s control over the composition of its own workforce.” The states suing the Trump administration in the Baltimore case are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin, along with Washington, D.C.",N/A
