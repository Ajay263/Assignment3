Key GOP senator won't support Trump loyalist Ed Martin to be D.C.'s top prosecutor,North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis' decision likely derails Martin's nomination as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/thom-tillis-wont-support-ed-martin-dc-us-attorney-rcna205104,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wouldn't support Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, likely blocking the path to confirmation for the “Stop the Steal” organizer who had closely aligned himself with Jan. 6 defendants. “I’ve indicated to the White House I wouldn’t support his nomination,” Tillis said Tuesday after meeting with Martin on Monday night. Tillis is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing Martin's nomination. The panel has 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, meaning if all other members aside from Tillis voted along party lines, the vote on Martin would end in a tie and his nomination would not be reported favorably to the full Senate. Trump's nomination of Martin, a longtime right-wing activist who had no prosecutorial experience until Trump named him as interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on the day of his inauguration, has raised major concerns with alumni of the office, which prosecutors both federal and local crimes in Washington. Tillis said his concerns about Martin’s involvement in the defense of people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were too much to overcome, but said that Martin agreed with him that there were hundreds of individuals who shouldn't have been included in Trump's mass pardons. “Mr. Martin did a good job of explaining the one area that I think he’s probably right, that there were some people that were over prosecuted, but there were some, 2 or 300 of them that should have never gotten a pardon. And he agreed with that, but the disagreement there had more to do,"" Tillis said. ""If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. Attorney for any district except the district where January 6 happened, the protest happened, I’d probably support him, but not in this district.” Martin opened up an investigation into the office's handling of Jan. 6 cases, and several federal prosecutors who worked on Capitol attack cases were fired during his tenure, while Martin demoted others. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney is set to expire on May 20. In a speech at the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, Martin called on “die-hard true Americans” to work until their “last breath” to “stop the steal.” Martin's association with a far-right Jan. 6 rioter who had posed in a Adolph Hitler mustache and who the Justice Department previously called an “an avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer"" also raised concerns during his nomination process, and Martin sought to distance himself from the defendant. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday that he wants ""to put people on the agenda when he ""can help the president be successful in his nominees and and that’s all I can say at this point."" Trump had pushed senators to support Martin as recently as Monday night, writing in a post on Truth Social that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., believed Martin's confirmation was ""IMPERATIVE in terms of doing all that has to be done to SAVE LIVES and to, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN."" Ryan J.

"Angus King III, son of the Maine senator, launches a run for governor",King is seeking to succeed term-limited Gov. Janet Mills. Both are Democrats.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/angus-king-iii-son-maine-senator-launches-run-governor-rcna204866,"Angus King III, an energy executive and a son of independent Sen. Angus King Jr. of Maine, will run for governor as a Democrat, he announced Tuesday. King wants to follow in the footsteps of his father, who served two terms as governor from 1995 to 2003. And he’s vying to replace term-limited Gov. Janet Mills, the longtime Maine Democrat who has made national news in recent months tangling with President Donald Trump’s administration over policies for transgender athletes. In an interview with NBC News ahead of his announcement, King emphasized that, during his career in the private sector, he's been ""building things that solve problems and help people."" ""If you were ever going to do it, now is the time. Right now, people are struggling, are scared. We just have a host of challenges that make life really hard,"" King said of leaving private life, where he's worked on issues like renewable energy and affordable housing, to seek public office. ""Right now, I'm going to run for governor to build a better Maine."" King becomes the second major Democrat to jump into the primary to replace Mills, alongside Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who has a long political resume that includes serving in the top post at Maine's chapter of the ACLU and The Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine, as well as a stint in the state Senate before becoming secretary of state in 2021. The top Republican candidates include Bobby Charles, a longtime former federal government official who served stints in staff positions at the State Department and in the House of Representatives. It's possible that more candidates could join the field, too, in a state that hasn't elected back-to-back governors from the same party in more than a half-century. King weighed in on Mills’ spat with the Trump administration over federal funding related to Maine’s policies toward transgender athletes, which the federal government said violated recent executive orders. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture froze funding for a child nutrition program in the state, the administration lifted the freeze last week and the state agreed to drop its lawsuit. King said that while he’s open to working with the Trump administration if it wants to help Mainers, “I’ll never rest when it comes to helping the people of Maine.” “Any time a bully steals your lunch money and you’re able to get it back from him, that’s a good thing. I’m proud of the governor for doing that,” he said. “I think that what the president has done to Maine, you don’t have to be a Democrat or an independent or a Republican or be from outer space, you know you shouldn’t play politics with kids' school lunches and Social Security,” King said. During his interview and launch video, King, 54, repeatedly pointed to a project he took on while working for a natural gas company in the state that turns cow manure into renewable fuel. The experience of bringing strange bedfellows together (a gas utility company and supporters of renewable energy) to accomplish a shared goal (sustainable energy that reduces emissions) is a theme King leans on heavily. “I haven’t spent my career in Augusta, I’m not a politician,"" he said, referring to the state capital. ""But I’ve spent it building and making things that help people. I did it by bringing people together and importantly, focusing on the things we have in common, not the things that divide us."" “Right now, there’s real value in having an outsider’s perspective, someone who’s built things, created jobs, worked on some of the toughest problems,” he added. While King may have spent his career as an outsider, he sports a very public reminder of his ties to one of the most prominent politicians in the state: his father. The elder King served two terms as Maine's governor and returned to politics in the 2012 election, when he won the Senate seat he now holds, succeeding retiring GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe. He was re-elected to his third term in November. But while the elder King has spent the last 30 years in politics as an independent, his son is running as a Democrat. (The elder King does caucus with Democrats in the Senate.) Asked why he’s choosing to run under the banner of one of the national political parties, he replied he has “a very easy answer.” “I am a Democrat,"" he said. ""I obviously have independent blood running through my body, and I think most people in Maine have independent blood running through their bodies,"" he added. Asked what he learned from the success of his father as well as the state's other political constant over the last few decades, Republican Sen. Susan Collins, King replied that most of Maine's successful politicians have been ""moderate, pragmatic, 'How do we get things done, how do we bring people together?' kind of people."" ""That’s exactly how I'm going to serve as governor of Maine. That's a terrific Maine tradition, and I fit pretty squarely into it,"" he said. He added, ""You can be successful in Maine even if you are not a harsh partisan."" Ben Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News",Ben Kamisar,"May 6, 2025, 12:00 PM GMT+2"
Trump says D.C. will host the 2027 NFL draft; Gov. Brian Kemp skips Georgia Senate race,Trump also discussed his plans to impose tariffs on imported movies and reopen Alcatraz prison in California.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-nfl-draft-tariffs-immigration-doge-live-updates-rcna204587,"Raquel Coronell Uribe In a Truth Social post tonight, Trump called for former Colorado county clerk Tina Peters to be released from prison and said he was directing the Justice Department to take ""all necessary action"" to help secure her release. Peters, who has peddled 2020 election conspiracy theories, was sentenced to nine years in prison by a Colorado state judge in October for official misconduct after a security breach of her county’s election equipment. She was convicted after she used another person’s security badge to give an associate of Mike Lindell access to her county’s voting systems, which resulted in secure information’s being posted online. “Colorado must end this unjust incarceration of an innocent American. I am hereby directing the Department of Justice to take all necessary action to help secure the release of this ‘hostage’ being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons. FREE TINA PETERS, NOW!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. The Justice Department asked a federal judge in March to consider a petition Peters filed challenging her conviction. The Department of Homeland Security is intensifying its efforts to persuade unauthorized immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and travel assistance. The agency announced today that those who use the CBP Home app to voluntarily leave the United States will receive assistance “to facilitate travel back to their home country” and $1,000 “paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app.” The announcement comes as the number of deportations has remained stagnant during Trump’s first 100 days in office. One of his key campaign promises was that he would enact mass deportations as soon as he took office. DHS did not immediately respond to questions about how the funds would be provided or what proof would be required to show people had returned to their home countries. Read the full story here. Raquel Coronell Uribe Former Vice President Mike Pence criticized Trump’s tariffs in an interview, saying the administration is advancing policies that will “ultimately harm the American economy.” “I do have concerns that with the president’s call for broad-based tariffs against friend and foe alike, that ultimately the administration is advancing policies that are not targeted at countries that have been abusing our trade relationship but rather are essentially new industrial policy and that will result in inflation that will harm consumers and ultimately harm the American economy,” Pence said in an interview that aired tonight on CNN. Pence added that even a minimum 10% tariff would “stifle American growth, limit prosperity, drive up costs for American consumers.” He also commented on Trump's remarks to NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" that children should have fewer dolls and fewer pencils, saying keeping toys affordable is “part of the American dream.” In its heyday, Alcatraz Island housed more than 260 prisoners, with notorious gangsters such as Al Capone, George “Machine Gun” Kelly and James “Whitey” Bulger serving time on the rocky outpost. With its closing in 1963 after it fell into disrepair, the federal prison off San Francisco found a new life as a popular tourist destination — one that continues to draw more than a million visitors a year as a national historic landmark. That could all change again if Trump gets his way. Trump wrote yesterday on social media that he is directing the federal Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department and other agencies to “reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz” to the most “ruthless and violent offenders.” But federal corrections experts and historians caution that while such a project may be especially “symbolic” to Trump, any plan would be incredibly expensive and inefficient, particularly when the federal government’s mission is to slash spending and prisons remain strained by staffing shortages. Read the full story here. A former Homeland Security official whom Trump accused of potentially “treasonous” conduct fears he is under federal investigation and plans to challenge what he calls an illegal attempt to silence critics. In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Miles Taylor said that he is prepared to “fight back” in court and that his repeated warnings that Trump would use presidential power to retaliate against perceived political enemies have proved accurate. “My concern was he would turn the government into a revenge machine, and that’s what’s happening,” Taylor said. Since Trump signed a memorandum last month calling for a review of Taylor’s conduct as a Department of Homeland Security official during Trump’s first term, government authorities have contacted former high school classmates and others associated with him, Taylor said. Read the full story here. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today directed a minimum of 20% reduction of four-star service members, as well as a 20% reduction of general officers in the National Guard and an additional 10% reduction in general and flag officers. Most of the affected officers will be eligible for retirement. Hegseth has argued that too many generals and admirals lead to wasteful spending and too much bureaucratic decision-making. “The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring the lethality of U.S. Military Forces to deter threats and, when necessary, achieve decisive victory. To accomplish this mission, we must cultivate exceptional senior leaders who drive innovation and operational excellence, unencumbered by unnecessary bureaucratic layers that hinder their growth and effectiveness,” the memo said. Scott Wong Reporting from Washington Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said tonight that she won’t seek the top Democratic post on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the panel that would be in the strongest position to investigate the Trump administration if Democrats were to win back the chamber next year. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., ran for the coveted position in December but was defeated by a more senior member of the committee, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. Last week, though, Connolly said that because his esophageal cancer had returned he would not seek re-election to Congress and would be stepping back from his day-to-day responsibilities on the Oversight panel. After speaking to colleagues, Ocasio-Cortez said tonight that she believed another bid for the post would be an uphill climb against another more senior member. “It’s actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe I’ll be staying put at Energy and Commerce,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters, referring to a separate committee. Read the full story here. In a new court filing, the Justice Department asked a federal judge in Texas not to revive the mifepristone abortion pill case. It is the first time the Trump administration has formally weighed in on the lawsuit. NBC News’ Gabe Gutierrez reports on the context of the case. Kyle Stewart Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said today that she will block the House Financial Services and Agriculture committees from holding a joint hearing on crypto tomorrow, adding that the Democrats will walk out and hold their own hearing “to discuss Trump’s ties to crypto and blatant abuses of power.” Waters is the top Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, meaning her consent is needed for the panel to hold a joint hearing with another committee. The Agriculture subcommittee on commodity markets, digital assets and rural development and the Financial Services subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology and artificial intelligence are scheduled to hold a hearing at 10 a.m. tomorrow titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: A Blueprint for the 21st Century.” Trump met with Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina today, who thanked Trump and the U.S. government in a video clip on X for bringing her home after she spent time in a Russian jail. “President Trump, I’m so grateful for you to bring me home. I’m here with your team today and feeling overwhelmed with all the great feelings. Feeling that I’m going to be home soon. And thank you and the government for bringing me home. It’s a lot of feelings which I would want to express. But the biggest one, I’m so proud and so blessed to be American citizen today. Thank you very much,” Karelina said in the video. White House adviser Margo Martin posted a video of the two meeting earlier today during which Karelina told Trump about how long she had been in jail. Karelina was released last month. She had been detained by Russia’s Federal Security Service in January 2024 while she was visiting family in Russia and was sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony for committing “high treason.” The FSB did not provide details of her alleged crime; a Russian legal group said she had donated more than $50 to a group that sends aid to Ukraine. Daniel Arkin Jon Voight has submitted a “comprehensive plan” to Trump mapping out ways to boost domestic film and television production, the Oscar-winning actor’s manager announced today. Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, met with Trump over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, according to a news release. Voight and Paul pitched their suite of ideas, including federal tax incentives, changes to various tax codes, co-production treaties with foreign countries and infrastructure subsidies for production companies and theater owners. The meeting took place before Trump called for duties on “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” decrying other nations for offering financial incentives that have lured producers away. Trump’s Truth Social post last night was met with a mix of confusion and fear by the entertainment industry. White House officials clarified today that “no final decisions” had been made and that they were “exploring all options.” It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s proposal would also apply to TV productions or exactly what part of physical production would be tariffed. Read the full story here. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted Trump over his comments to NBC News in an interview that aired yesterday in which he said he didn't know whether he has to uphold the Constitution. “It’s appalling. He doesn’t know if he’s supposed to uphold the Constitution? He swore an oath to that effect; he might have forgotten that,” Schumer said on the Senate floor this afternoon. “It’s hard to imagine something more un-American than Donald Trump, the sitting president, saying he doesn’t know whether he needs to uphold the Constitution,” he said. “One of the traits of a dictator is someone hostile to all forms of guardrails and accountability, who doesn’t want to hear any dissent. Well, the Constitution is the ultimate guardrail, and Donald Trump thinks he doesn’t need to obey it,” Schumer added. Raquel Coronell Uribe Trump signed an executive order this afternoon that the White House said was designed to “promote domestic manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.” “It streamlines the permitting processes that go into building domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing sites. It centers a lot of the environmental permitting process that is quite significant within the EPA, and it takes other actions designed to ensure that we’re bringing pharmaceutical jobs and pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States of America,” a White House aide told Trump about the content of the order before he signed it. The White House has not yet released the text of the order. TeleMessage, the app that Trump’s former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, appeared to use to archive his group chats, has suspended all services after hackers claimed to have stolen files from it. A spokesperson for Smarsh, the company that owns TeleMessage, said today that the company “is investigating a potential security incident. Upon detection, we acted quickly to contain it and engaged an external cybersecurity firm to support our investigation.” “Out of an abundance of caution, all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended,” the spokesperson said.

Brian Kemp to run against Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in 2026, said “obviously we’re disappointed” that Kemp decided against running. “He, of course, would have been a great candidate, but as I’ve said before, that race is going to be competitive either way,"" Thune said. Thune said “there’s a lot of interest” among Republicans in the state in running for the nomination, but when NBC News asked whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene could win a statewide race in Georgia, he said, “I don’t know the answer to that.” “I mean, obviously that’s up to the people of Georgia, but I know there are several in the House delegation over there that are expressing interest and some other statewides, too,” Thune said. Ben Kamisar The Trump administration has not publicly released any accounting of who funded the transition efforts after he won the 2024 election, blowing past the timeline in which previous administrations have disclosed transition donors, despite having pledged last year to release the names. Unlike other transition efforts, Trump’s most recent transition was not subject to the disclosure requirements or donation limits laid out in federal law. That’s because it chose not to accept public funds for the effort. Otherwise, it would have been required to make those disclosures 30 days after he took office and cap donations at $5,000. Read the full story here. Syedah Asghar House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters today that his timeline of passing a sweeping bill for Trump's agenda could slip past his deadline of Memorial Day. “If it’s not done before Memorial Day, it will be shortly thereafter, but our timetable is on pace, and we’re going to get this done ASAP,” Johnson said. Johnson said a meeting with Trump last Thursday to coordinate on the legislation “was truncated due to other events,” so House Republicans needed more time to hammer out the details. Kyle Stewart Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., announced she will retire at the end of her term this Congress and not seek re-election in 2026. Schakowsky will have served for 14 terms as a member of the House. Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old internet personality, entered the race for Schakowsky’s seat. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced today that he will pass on a run for the Senate in what is expected to be one of the most hotly contested Senate races of the 2026 cycle. “Over the last few weeks, I have had many conversations with friends, supporters, and leaders across the country who encouraged me to run for the US Senate in 2026. I greatly appreciate their support and prayers for our family,"" Kemp said in a statement on X. ""After those discussions, I have decided that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for me and my family.” Kemp was a top recruit of Senate Republicans hoping to win back the seat in Georgia held by Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. His decision to pass will set off a scramble for the Republican nomination. Rebecca Shabad Trump said today that the United States will “help the people of Gaza get some food."" ""People are starving, and we’re going to help them get some food,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office. ""Hamas is making it impossible because they’re taking everything that’s brought in.” Israel's security Cabinet approved a plan to seize all of the Gaza Strip as part of an expanded military operation to defeat Hamas. Israel has blocked humanitarian aid from entering Gaza over the last few months as negotiations have failed to reach another ceasefire. Trump has previously said that the United States would take control of Gaza and that its residents would be moved elsewhere and not allowed to return. Sydney CarruthSydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News. Trump claimed he had “nothing to do” with the artificial intelligence-generated image of him dressed as the pope that he shared on Truth Social and the White House posted on X. “The Catholics loved it,” Trump told a reporter in the White House this afternoon. “I had nothing to do with it. Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the pope, and they put it out on the internet. That’s not me that did it.” Some Catholic leaders condemned the image, which was shared less than a week Pope Francis died. Sydney CarruthSydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News. Trump said he wants to meet with the film and TV industry to discuss his plan for imposing 100% tariffs on films produced outside of the U.S., adding he is “not looking to hurt the industry."" “They have the nice sign and everything’s good, but they don’t do very much. A lot of it’s been taken to other countries, and a big proportion,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after his NFL Draft announcement. “I’m actually going to meet with some because, you know, there’s some advantages, I guess.” Trump added that it’s “shocking” the film industry has moved production operations out of Hollywood to seek lower operating costs. Aria Bendix Twenty state attorneys general sued the Trump administration today over its mass firings and the dismantling of agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. The lawsuit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, alleges that the administration violated hundreds of laws and bypassed congressional authority by endeavoring to consolidate the number of HHS agencies from 28 to 15 and initiating layoffs of around 20,000 employees.

The director of the federal Bureau of Prisons said he has ordered an “immediate assessment” to determine how to renovate and reopen the Alcatraz prison, the notorious maximum security penitentiary off the coast of San Francisco that has not been functional since 1963. “The Bureau of Prisons will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President’s agenda,” the director, William K. Marshall III, said in a statement. “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps. Megan Lebowitz Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the far right group the Proud Boys, said in a post to X yesterday that he met with Trump on Saturday. Tarrio had been facing a sentence of 22 years in federal prison after being convicted of seditious conspiracy for actions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but Trump granted him clemency along with rioters and others convicted of involvement in the attack in one of his first acts of his second term. ""Yesterday, I had the honor of meeting the President of the United States, a moment I never could have imagined in my darkest days,"" Tarrio said in the post. He also praised Trump as ""the greatest president since George Washington."" ""My deepest gratitude goes to my family, my brotherhood, my friends, and every person who fought for justice and helped elect the greatest president since George Washington,"" he wrote. ""Together, we did it."" Adam Edelman Trump’s wide-ranging interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker tackled virtually every major policy issue the White House has touched in the more than three months since he took office again. The pair discussed a broad variety of economic issues, including inflation, his tariffs and cryptocurrency — as well as the question of whether Trump was profiting off the presidency. They also delved into immigration issues during the hour-plus conversation, looking at border crossings, deportations and questions about due process, as well as budget issues, including how much money Trump's Department of Government Efficiency has saved and whether Medicaid will see cuts.

Their conversation covered ""many subjects, including the War with Russia/Ukraine, all things Syria, Gaza, and more,"" Trump wrote. ""The President invited me to go to Turkey at a future date and, likewise, he will be coming to Washington, D.C. During my four years as President, my relationship with President Erdoğan was excellent,"" Trump wrote. Trump said he looks forward to working with Erdoğan ""on getting the ridiculous, but deadly, War between Russia and Ukraine ended — NOW!” Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump told NBC News he plans to hold several events to celebrate U.S. military victories this year, including a “big, beautiful” military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate Flag Day, which also happens to fall on his birthday. “My birthday happens to be on Flag Day,” Trump told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in a wide-ranging interview at Mar-a-Lago that aired yesterday. “I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday. Somebody put it together. But no, I think we’re going to do something on June 14 maybe or somewhere around there. But I think June 14. It’s a very important day.” Read the full story.

The central African nation of Rwanda is in discussions with the Trump administration on a possible deal to accept deported migrants from the United States, the country’s foreign minister said late yesterday. Olivier Nduhungirehe told state broadcaster Rwanda TV that early talks were under way, according to the Reuters news agency. The news followed multiple news reports that the U.S. was seeking an international partnership to deport people, amid an ongoing crackdown on foreign visa holders, student activists and suspected criminal gang members.

Karelina was released from a Russian prison last month after spending more than a year in custody following allegations of financially supporting Ukraine’s military. She was arrested in Russia in February 2024 and sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony after she donated $52 to a charity that sends aid to Ukraine. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump said yesterday he will direct several federal agencies to “reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz,” a facility that for decades was a federal prison and is now a national park. “REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ! For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Read the full story. Jennifer Jett Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had a “very warm and positive conversation” with the president after Albanese was re-elected over the weekend in a race that was driven largely by an anti-Trump backlash. Albanese told reporters in Canberra today that he and Trump would “continue to engage” on tariffs, as well as the AUKUS security agreement, and that “we will engage with each other on a face-to-face basis at some time in the future.” Australia was the second liberal democracy in a week after Canada to hold an election in which the incumbent government made an unlikely comeback amid growing public anger over tariffs and other Trump administration policies. Like his counterpart in Canada, the conservative candidate in Australia, Peter Dutton, not only lost the election, but also lost his seat in Parliament. Trump said earlier that Albanese, who took office in 2022, had been “very nice to me, very respectful to me” and that they have “a very good relationship.” “I have no idea who the other person is that ran against him,” he told reporters at the White House last night. The Associated Press Former Vice President Mike Pence yesterday repeatedly invoked the Constitution and said it is what “binds us all together” after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump’s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The award recognizes Pence “for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,” the JFK Library Foundation said.

Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump announced plans yesterday to implement a 100% tariff on movies made in other countries that are imported to the United States, decrying other nations for offering financial incentives meant to “draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.” “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to foreign films as “messaging and propaganda.” Read the full story. Nnamdi Egwuonwu Trump offered his clearest indication yet that he will leave the White House at the end of his second term without trying to extend his stay, acknowledging the constraints preventing him from seeking a third term in an exclusive interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Trump also highlighted several other rising stars in the Republican Party he said are capable of carrying the MAGA mantle after he’s finished as the GOP’s elected leader, mentioning not only Vice President JD Vance, but also Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has become a central player in his second administration.

Alexandra Marquez Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that he’d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary. The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that the Amazon was going to begin to list tariff charges on certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to impose 145% tariffs on China. Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: “Sure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them.” Read the full story. Alexandra Marquez Hanna Trudo, who most recently worked as a senior political correspondent at The Hill, is considering jumping into the Democratic primary to replace Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., as Pappas runs for Senate next year. Trudo, who is a New Hampshire native, wrote in a memo that she is ""exploring running"" in the primary in New Hampshire's First District and said that she's moved back to the state since Pappas announced he would run for Senate. ""I haven’t poll tested my pitch,"" Trudo wrote. ""I’m simply writing with the same fire I’ve spit for the past decade: Democrats must be better."" In the memo, Trudo called out Trump and his advisers, including tech mogul Elon Musk, writing, ""Under Donald Trump’s off-brand of authoritarian politics, we are no longer free. Our First Amendment freedoms are being cruelly ripped away by Trump, Elon Musk and other obscenely rich, unelected tech lackeys who have contempt for us."" Trump argued in an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that fulfilling his ambitious campaign promise to rapidly carry out mass deportations may take precedence over giving immigrants the right to due process under the Constitution, as required by courts. A central part of Trump’s agenda has been implementing the “largest deportation operation” in U.S. history, as he vowed during the 2024 campaign. In service of that goal, his administration has pressed the courts to allow the immediate removal of immigrants it accuses of being members of a Venezuelan gang, without giving them a chance to plead their case before a judge.

Federal judge says results of North Carolina court race with Democrat ahead must be certified,More than 5.5 million ballots were cast in what has been the country's last undecided race from the general election in November.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/federal-judge-says-results-north-carolina-court-race-democrat-ahead-mu-rcna205013,"RALEIGH, N.C. — Disputed ballots in the still unresolved 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count, a federal judge ruled late Monday, a decision that if upheld would result in an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. U.S. District Judge Richard Myers agreed with Riggs and others who argued it would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution to carry out recent decisions by state appeals courts that directed the removal of potentially thousands of voter ballots deemed ineligible. Myers wrote that votes couldn’t be removed six months after Election Day without damaging due process and equal protection rights of the affected residents. Myers also ordered the State Board of Elections to certify results that after two recounts showed Riggs the winner — by just 734 votes — over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin. But the judge delayed his decisions for seven days in case Griffin wants to appeal the ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Follow live politics coverage here The board “must not proceed with implementation of the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court’s orders, and instead must certify the results of the election for (the seat) based on the tally at the completion of the canvassing period,” wrote Myers, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump. More than 5.5 million ballots were cast in what has been the nation’s last undecided race from November’s general election. Griffin, himself a state Court of Appeals judge, filed formal protests after the election in hopes that removing ballots he said were unlawfully cast would flip the outcome to him. Griffin’s legal team was reviewing Myers’ order Monday night and evaluating the next steps, Griffin campaign spokesperson Paul Shumaker wrote in an email. Riggs was more assured in her statement: “Today, we won. I‘m proud to continue upholding the Constitution and the rule of law as North Carolina’s Supreme Court Justice.” Griffin wanted Myers to leave undisturbed the state courts’ decisions, which also directed that most of the voters with otherwise ineligible ballots get 30 days to provide identifying information for their race choices to remain in the tally. Riggs, the state Democratic Party and some affected voters said Griffin was trying to change the 2024 election outcome after the fact by removing ballots cast by voters who complied with voting rules as they were written last fall. Myers wrote that Griffin’s formal protests after the election, which were rejected by the State Board of Elections, constituted efforts to make retroactive changes to the voting laws that would arbitrarily disenfranchise only the voters who were targeted by Griffin. Griffin’s challenges over voters not providing photo identification only covered at most six Democratic-leaning counties in the state. “You establish the rules before the game. You don’t change them after the game is done,” Myers wrote in a 68-page order. “Permitting parties to ‘upend the set rules’ of an election after the election has taken place can only produce ‘confusion and turmoil’” that “‘threatens to undermine public confidence in the federal courts, state agencies, and the elections themselves,’” he added while citing other cases. Democrats and voting rights groups raised alarm about Griffin’s efforts. They called it an attack on democracy that would serve as a road map for the GOP to reverse election results in other states. The state Republican Party said Griffin was seeking to ensure that only legal votes are counted. One category of ballots that state appeals courts declared violated the state constitution were cast by overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. but whose parents were declared North Carolina residents. A state law passed in 2011 had authorized these persons to vote in state elections. The other category covered military or overseas voters who didn’t provide copies of photo identification or an ID exception form with their absentee ballots. A state rule exempted them from the requirement. The appeals courts had permitted a “cure” process for the voters who didn’t provide IDs so their ballots could still count in the race. While North Carolina can certainly establish rules for future state elections, Myers wrote, they can’t be applied after the fact to only a select group of voters. Griffin filed formal protests that appeared to cover more than 65,000 ballots. Ensuing state court rulings whittled down the total to as few as 1,675 ballots or perhaps as many as 7,000, according to court filings. Riggs is one of only two Democrats on the seven-member state Supreme Court, and winning an eight-year term would improve the party’s efforts to retake a majority on the court later in the decade. Griffin and Riggs have not participated in deliberations in their respective courts about their election.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won't seek the top Democratic seat on the House Oversight Committee,"After speaking to colleagues, the progressive New York congresswoman said she believed Democrats would favor a more senior member in the role, as they did in the previous race.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/aoc-wont-seek-top-democratic-seat-house-oversight-committee-rcna205002,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Monday night that she won’t seek the top Democratic post on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the panel that would be in the strongest position to investigate the Trump administration if Democrats were to win back the chamber next year. Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, ran for the coveted position in December but was defeated by a more senior member of the committee, Gerry Connolly, of Virginia. Last week, though, Connolly said that because his esophageal cancer had returned, he wouldn’t seek re-election to Congress and would step back from his day-to-day responsibilities on the Oversight panel. After having spoken to colleagues, Ocasio-Cortez said Monday that she believed another bid for the post would be an uphill climb against another more senior member. “It’s actually clear to me that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary, and so I believe I’ll be staying put at Energy and Commerce,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters, referring to a separate committee. She had no comment on whom she might support in the Oversight race. “There’s no vacancy. There’s no official race yet, so I won’t comment on that, and I want to be respectful of ranking member Connolly,” she said. Follow live politics coverage here It's a surprising turn given that Ocasio-Cortez, who has been attracting thousands of supporters at speeches around the country and has been floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said just days ago that she was weighing a bid to secure the post. If Democrats retake the House in 2026, the Oversight chair's gavel could have provided her with an enormous platform and authority to investigate the Trump administration. Because she left the Oversight panel to take a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Ocasio-Cortez would have needed a waiver from the Democratic Caucus to return to Oversight. But several colleagues said they believed she would have been the prohibitive favorite for the job had she decided to run. In December, Connolly beat back a challenge from Ocasio-Cortez in a 131-84 vote by House Democrats. She said Monday that she doesn't believe the result would be much different if she squared off against a different member with more seniority. Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., is the third most senior member on the panel and is filling in for Connolly on an interim basis. Lynch announced last week that he will run for the Oversight job and that Connolly has endorsed him. In addition to Lynch, other Democrats have been reaching out to colleagues about possibly running for the position, including Kweisi Mfume, of Maryland; Maxwell Frost, of Florida; and Jasmine Crockett, of Texas.

Trump administration says Harvard will receive no new grants until it meets White House demands,The president has threatened to end the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status as an educational institution.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-says-harvard-will-receive-no-new-grants-meets-whi-rcna205003,"WASHINGTON — Harvard University will receive no new federal grants until it meets a series of demands from President Donald Trump’s administration, the Education Department announced Monday. The action was laid out in a letter to Harvard’s president and amounts to a major escalation of Trump’s battle with the Ivy League school. The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, and Trump is pushing to strip the school of its tax-exempt status. Harvard has pushed back on the administration’s demands, setting up a closely watched clash in Trump’s attempt to force change at universities that he says have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism. In a press call, an Education Department official said Harvard will receive no new federal grants until it “demonstrates responsible management of the university” and satisfies federal demands on a range of subjects. It applies to federal research grants and not federal financial aid students receive to help cover tuition and fees. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the decision on a call with reporters. Follow live politics coverage here The official accused Harvard of “serious failures” in four areas: antisemitism, racial discrimination, abandonment of rigor and viewpoint diversity. To become eligible for new grants, Harvard would need to enter negotiations with the federal government and prove it has satisfied the administration’s demands. The administration has demanded a series of changes to campus policy, including reforms to crack down on protesters and pursue more viewpoint diversity among faculty. In a letter Monday to Harvard’s president, Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the school of enrolling foreign students who showed contempt for the U.S. “Harvard University has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,” McMahon wrote. Harvard’s president has previously said he will not bend to government’s demands. The university sued to halt its funding freeze last month. Harvard’s suit called the funding freeze “arbitrary and capricious,” saying it violated its First Amendment rights and the statutory provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Trump administration said previously that Harvard would need to meet a series of conditions to keep almost $9 billion in grants and contracts. The school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has an endowment of $53 billion, the largest in the country. Across the university, federal money accounted for 10.5% of revenue in 2023, not counting financial aid such as grants and student loans.

Jon Voight met with Trump before president proposed tariffs on foreign film productions,"Voight, whom Trump tapped as one of three special ambassadors to the film industry, said the president “will help us make Hollywood great again.”",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jon-voight-hollywood-plan-donald-trump-tariffs-rcna204968,"Jon Voight has submitted a “comprehensive plan” to President Donald Trump mapping out ways to boost domestic film and television production, the Oscar-winning actor’s manager announced Monday. Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, met with Trump over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, according to a news release. Voight and Paul pitched their suite of ideas, including federal tax incentives, changes to various tax codes, co-production treaties with foreign countries and infrastructure subsidies for production companies and theater owners. The meeting took place before Trump called for duties on “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” decrying other nations for offering financial incentives that have lured producers away. Trump's Truth Social post Sunday night was met with a mix of confusion and fear by the entertainment industry. White House officials clarified Monday that “no final decisions” had been made and that they were “exploring all options.” It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s proposal would also apply to TV productions or and exactly what part of physical production would be tariffed. Voight and Paul’s proposal includes what the two characterize as “tariffs in certain limited circumstances.” The news release otherwise does not mention tariffs. Voight is one of three stars Trump tapped to be “special ambassadors to Hollywood,” which Trump has called a “great but very troubled place.” The two others are Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone. In a statement, Voight said in part: “The President loves the entertainment business and this country, and he will help us make Hollywood great again.” “We look forward to working with the administration, the unions, studios, and streamers to help form a plan to keep our industry healthy and bring more productions back to America,” he added. “By creating the right environment through smart incentives, updated policies, and much-needed support, we can ensure that American production companies thrive, more jobs stay here at home, and Hollywood once again leads the world in creativity and innovation."" In recent years, the American film industry has suffered a series of economic blows. Covid and two labor strikes upended the content pipeline. Physical production has declined in California amid budget cuts and more generous tax incentives elsewhere. Voight is known for his conservative political views. He is one of Trump’s highest-profile celebrity backers, having once called him “the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.” Voight won the Academy Award for best actor for the Vietnam war drama “Coming Home” (1978) and starred in the best picture winner “Midnight Cowboy” (1969). He is also known for his roles in films such as “Deliverance,” “Mission: Impossible” and “Ali.” Paul is a producer, actor and talent manager who founded the independent production company Crystal Sky Pictures.

In today’s edition, we break down a key development in the 2026 battle for the Senate majority.

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Republicans were dealt a major blow in their bid to expand their Senate majority on Monday, with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp passing a run against the party’s top target for defeat, Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. As Bridget Bowman and Sahil Kapur report, Kemp was viewed as the GOP’s leading recruit in Georgia, one of two states President Donald Trump carried in 2024 with a Democratic-held Senate seat that’s up in 2026. The other is Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring. The background: Kemp has shown a rare ability to appeal to both conservative and middle-of-the-road voters. After Kemp opposed efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, Trump backed former Sen. David Perdue in the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary. But Kemp easily defeated Perdue before going on to win re-election by nearly 8 points over Stacey Abrams, just two years after Joe Biden became the first Democrat to carry Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. Plan B: It’s unclear what Kemp’s next steps will be, as he’s unable to seek re-election next year due to term limits. But his decision to forgo a Senate run will likely spark a crowded and competitive GOP primary to take on Ossoff. Multiple members of Georgia’s congressional delegation — including Reps. Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Mike Collins and Marjorie Taylor Greene — have suggested they would consider a bid if Kemp did not run. Greene indicated to NBC News last week that she’s weighing a Senate run. “I have just a lot of options open to me,” she said. Among other statewide elected Republicans, Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper and Insurance Commissioner John King are also seen as potential candidates. The map: Ultimately, the Georgia seat will likely be more important to Democrats as they try to eat into the GOP’s 53-47 majority. In addition to Michigan, Democrats also have open seats to defend in Minnesota and New Hampshire. And the party’s offensive opportunities are relatively limited, with Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina seen as the most vulnerable Republicans. Read more from Bridget and Sahil → Over in the House: Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., announced she will not seek re-election next year after serving 14 terms in the House. Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old internet personality, had already entered the race for Schakowsky’s safe Democratic seat. The Department of Homeland Security is spending big bucks — almost $21 million so far, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact — on an ad campaign featuring Secretary Kristi Noem heaping praise on President Donald Trump and calling on immigrants in America illegally to “leave now.” It’s an amount of money that’s in line with what a prominent statewide campaign might spend, according to AdImpact. By comparison, liberal candidate Susan Crawford spent $28 million on ads while conservative candidate Brad Schimel spent $15 million during last month’s closely watched Wisconsin Supreme Court election. In last year’s election, Pennsylvania Republican Dave McCormick spent $21 million on ads in one of the most competitive Senate races on the battleground map. The vast majority of the DHS spots feature Noem speaking directly to the camera, touting Trump and warning, “If you are here illegally, we will find you and we will deport you. You will never return. But if you leave now, you may have an opportunity to return.” Other variations include Noem blasting “weak politicians” for leaving “our borders wide open,” while others feature her speaking in English with Spanish subtitles. Other more targeted ads show Noem detailing a list of “illegal aliens caught because of President Trump’s leadership.” Some spots also feature footage of arrests and from her visit to the El Salvador prison where deported Venezuelans are being held. The ads are broadly targeted to newscasts like morning and nightly news shows on major broadcast networks, and Spanish-language channels. The federal government has spent billions in taxpayer funds over the years on advertising campaigns, including on those to highlight government programs or encourage recruitment. Healthcare.gov, the federal health care exchange, has benefitted from tens of millions of dollars in advertising over the years, with the Obama administration running ads to encourage sign-ups (including in red states). The Biden administration also spent $50 million to note how the 2021 Covid relief law created new subsidies for health insurance. But what’s particularly notable about the new DHS ad campaign is how heavily Noem, a former South Dakota governor who, at 53, could have a long political career ahead of her, is featured. And soon, Noem won’t be the only Trump administration official whose agency spends tens of millions of dollars to broadcast its message on the airwaves. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to launch his own public relations effort, according to a document obtained by NBC News that says the campaign would include up to three ads a day across major TV networks.

Trump hasn't said who funded his presidential transition effort despite pledging to disclose donors,The White House didn't respond to multiple questions about when the transition would disclose who funded it.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-not-said-funded-presidential-transition-effort-pledging-disclose-rcna204785,"President Donald Trump’s administration has not publicly released any accounting of who funded the transition efforts after he won the 2024 election, blowing past the timeline in which previous administrations have disclosed transition donors, despite pledging last year to release the names. Unlike other transition efforts, Trump’s most recent transition was not subject to the disclosure requirements or donation limits laid out in federal law. That's because it chose not to accept public funds for the effort. Otherwise, it would have been required to make those disclosures 30 days after taking office and cap donations at $5,000. Still, the Trump transition team said in a November statement that “donors to the transition will be disclosed to the public,” and those disclosures have not yet been made. The White House did not reply to multiple questions from NBC News about when the transition team would release a list of its donors. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, was the spokesperson for the president’s transition. Rules regarding presidential transition funding are governed by the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. Most of the law outlines how nominees and presidents-elect are able to get a jump start on the massive change from campaigning to governing a federal bureaucracy, laying out topics like what can be done before or after the election, how the transition team can work with the outgoing administration and what should be spelled out in a transition team’s ethics plan. But the act also includes guardrails for how these efforts are funded, both publicly and privately. The federal government allows presidents-elect to tap into a pool of millions of dollars for transitions, including for securing office space and hiring staff. It also allows for private donations, capped at $5,000 per donor. But the donation cap and the requirement to lay out the transition team’s donors are contingent on accepting the public funding in the first place. If a transition doesn’t take public dollars, then it doesn't need to follow those rules. That’s what the Trump transition decided to do, in a break with tradition. In a November news release announcing that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the outgoing administration, the Trump transition team disclosed it would “utilize private funding ... providing cost savings to the American taxpayers.” Left unsaid was that the decision unshackled the Trump team from those disclosure requirements and fundraising limits. But the Trump transition did add that “donors to the Transition will be disclosed to the public” and “the Transition will not accept foreign donations.” The novel decision by the Trump transition to eschew public funding, placing it outside the purview of disclosure law and donation caps, prompted some experts to question whether the law needs to be strengthened to mandate disclosure in more cases. “The Presidential Transition Act assumes that candidates want to accept the services of government agencies before the election, before inauguration,” Valerie Smith Boyd told NBC News in February when she was the director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. She’s no longer with the organization. “The transparency requirements are tied to accepting those services. There is a new question as to whether that is the right recipe in the law,” she added. Trump’s transition ahead of his first term agreed to accept public funding and raised an additional $6.5 million and spent almost $4.7 million, according to a report filed with the General Services Administration in February 2017. While donations have to be specifically itemized, the only information typically disclosed about spending is how much was spent in certain categories, such as payroll, travel and legal expenses.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp passes on running for a key Democratic-held Senate seat,"Kemp, a Republican, was considered a strong potential candidate. Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for re-election in 2026 in a state Trump carried last year.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/georgia-gov-brian-kemp-passes-running-key-democratic-held-senate-seat-rcna204926,"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has decided not to run for the Senate next year, dealing a blow to Republicans who viewed him as a top recruit. The state is a major target for Republicans as they look to expand their three-seat Senate majority. Georgia is one of two states, along with Michigan, where Democrats are defending a seat in a state that President Donald Trump won in November. Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for re-election in Georgia, while Sen. Gary Peters is retiring in Michigan. Kemp, who is in his second term and cannot run for re-election as governor because of term limits, said in a statement on X that a Senate run is ""not the right decision for me and my family. ""I spoke with President Trump and Senate leadership earlier today and expressed my commitment to work alongside them to ensure we have a strong Republican nominee who can win next November,"" Kemp wrote, ""and ultimately be a conservative voice in the US Senate who will put hardworking Georgians first."" Kemp's decision could spark a competitive GOP primary to take on Ossoff, who won his seat in a dramatic Jan. 5, 2021, runoff following the 2020 general election. Multiple members of Georgia's congressional delegation — including Reps. Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick, Mike Collins and Marjorie Taylor Greene — have suggested they would consider a bid if Kemp did not run. Greene, the far-right congresswoman, indicated to NBC News last week that she is considering a Senate run. “I have just a lot of options open to me,” she said, without engaging on whether she is being encouraged to run or actively making calls about it. “Not really discussing it at this time,” she said. Among other statewide elected Republicans, Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper posted on X in February that he met with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Insurance Commissioner John King told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution late last year that he would “take a hard look” at a Senate run — if Kemp stayed out. Republicans expressed confidence that they were in a strong position to flip the seat, even without Kemp as their nominee. ""While Jon Ossoff is running to impeach President Trump, Republicans have a number of strong candidates who can build a winning coalition to add this seat to President Trump's Senate Majority,"" NRSC spokeswoman Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement, referring to Ossoff's recent comments that Trump “has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.” Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman Maeve Coyle said Kemp's decision is ""yet another embarrassing Republican Senate recruitment failure as they face a building midterm backlash where every GOP candidate will be forced to answer for Trump’s harmful agenda. Senate Republicans’ toxic agenda and recruitment failures put their majority at risk in 2026."" Republicans had viewed Kemp as a top contender if he ran against Ossoff, with the NRSC chair, Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, openly calling him his party's ""No. 1 recruit"" in an interview with Semafor in January. Kemp won his second term in 2022 by nearly 8 percentage points, winning more than 53% of the vote in a race against Democrat Stacey Abrams two years after President Joe Biden narrowly carried the state. Kemp also easily fended off a primary challenge in 2022 from GOP former Sen. David Perdue, who had Trump's endorsement. Trump targeted Kemp for opposing Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, vowing to campaign against him and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who also defeated a Trump-backed challenger in 2022. Kemp's strong performance in that primary showed that he was able to maintain support from the party's conservative base of supporters. After Kemp endorsed Trump's presidential run last year, Trump thanked him ""for all of your help and support in Georgia."" Kemp was first elected governor in 2018, beating Abrams by around 1 point in a banner year for Democrats. Bridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.

Trump announces the 2027 NFL draft will be in Washington,The president said that the draft would be held on the National Mall.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-set-announce-2027-nfl-draft-will-washington-possibly-national-ma-rcna204753,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Monday that the 2027 NFL draft would be held in Washington, D.C. on the National Mall. ""The draft is a celebration of one of our country's most cherished cultural institutions, and the annual highlights for football fans everywhere,"" Trump said. ""Everyone in the world is going to be watching."" Trump made the announcement from the Oval Office, flanked by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris, among other officials. The three spoke briefly, and Bowser touted the draft's ability to bring business to the city. ""We believe in investing in sports because they have helped us transform neighborhoods, and the NFL bringing this event to the nation's capital will help us fill hotel rooms, our restaurants, and Americans from all 50 states will come to their nation's capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums,"" Bowser said. NBC News previously reported that the announcement was expected. Axios was first to report the expected announcement. The NFL declined to comment on Sunday. The NFL draft is an annual selection of the top college football players by individual teams. To be eligible, players must have been out of high school for at least three years. From 1965 to 2014, the draft took place in New York City, but it has since rotated to different host cities. More than 600,000 people were on site in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last month for the most recent three-day event. The announcement comes as Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser went public last week with plans to return to Washington and build a new stadium after 27 years in Maryland. The president praised the plans, saying in the Oval Office that he did not think ""there is a better site anywhere in the world than that site."" Trump, who once owned a United States Football League team and aspired (but failed) to own an NFL franchise, followed the 2025 draft from afar. He criticized NFL owners on social media for not taking Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders in the first round. “What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be ‘picked’ IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!” Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was expected to be a top pick but fell to the fifth round before he was taken by the Cleveland Browns. The president has a history of sparring with the NFL. During his first term, he called on owners to fire players who were kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice and other issues and claimed the protests were hurting the league's television ratings and ticket sales. At a Sept. 2017 rally, Trump said, “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a b---- off the field right now? Out! He’s fired. He’s fired.'"" In a statement that did not mention Trump by name, Goodell referred to the president's comments as “divisive” and said they showed “an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.” Trump then shot back at Goodell, saying, ""Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country. Tell them to stand!"" The president doubled down on his criticism of anthem protests during a 2018 Fox News interview, saying ""maybe"" people who protested during the national anthem ""shouldn't be in the country.""

"DHS to pay $1,000 to undocumented immigrants who self-deport","The Department of Homeland Security announced it will provide travel assistance and a $1,000 stipend to those who use the CBP Home App to leave the United States.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-pay-1000-undocumented-immigrants-deport-rcna204859,"The Department of Homeland Security is intensifying its efforts to persuade unauthorized immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and travel assistance. The federal agency announced Monday that those who use the CBP Home app to voluntarily leave the United States will receive assistance ""to facilitate travel back to their home country"" and $1,000 ""paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app."" The announcement comes as the number of deportations has remained stagnant during President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. One of the president's key campaign promises was that he would enact mass deportations as soon as he took office. DHS did not immediately respond to questions about how the funds would be provided or what proof would be required to show the person had returned to their home country. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in late March that those who are self-deporting can use biographical data, documents, facial images and geo location in the app to prove that they have left the country. “The alien must be at least three miles outside of the United States to successfully utilize this feature,” she said. “While the use of the verify departure functionality is optional, if the alien chooses to use it, they must submit a facial image. It's required.” In a press release, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said self-deportations are ""the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest."" A single deportation costs U.S. taxpayers $17,121, according to DHS. The federal agency expects self-deportations to decrease that cost by 70%, even after factoring in the stipend. So far this year, at least 5,000 immigrants have reportedly used CBP Home to say that they were voluntarily leaving the country, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank. DHS has declined to say how many unauthorized immigrants have used the app so far to self-deport. According to Appfigures, a company that tracks app downloads, CBP Home app has recently been downloaded about 1,500 times per day. Since the start of 2025, the app was downloaded about 300,000 times, according to the company’s CEO, Ariel Michaeli. In March, the Trump administration repurposed the Biden-era CBP One app that allowed migrants to enter the U.S. legally as asylum-seekers, changing it into the CBP Home app. This version of the mobile application has a self-deportation reporting feature. The Trump administration has spent $200 million in revamping the app and creating an accompanying advertising campaign featuring Noem to promote the app's use. The ads, which have aired in English and Spanish across the U.S. and Mexico, encourage immigrants who are not legally present in the U.S. to leave the country. As part of their announcement Monday, DHS said that undocumented immigrants who ""submit their intent to voluntarily self-deport in CBP Home will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure."" The agency also said that self-deportation through the app ""may help preserve the option for an illegal alien to re-enter the United States legally in the future,"" echoing key points Noem touts in her ads. Immigration experts and advocates have previously warned of Noem’s self-deportation message and the possibility of being able to legally return to the U.S. “The operative word in that quote from the secretary is ‘may,’” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, told NBC News in March. “For many people who leave the United States, there may never be a lawful option for return to the United States, or reentry may be barred for many years,” Heidi Altman, the vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization, told NBC News in a statement in March. “Forcing or coercing people into leaving their homes and their loved ones carries political, moral, and economic costs.” Nicole Acevedo is a national reporter for NBC News and NBC Latino.

Trump set to raise millions from crypto and meme coin this month,"The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/trump-set-raise-millions-crypto-meme-coin-month-rcna204847,"President Donald Trump has two crypto-focused dinners on the calendar this month — one aimed at deep-pocketed political donors, the other at meme coin millionaires. Both are poised to help him rake in millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory. The second, on May 22, offers access to Trump’s inner circle not for cash — but for holders of the $TRUMP token. Hosted by MAGA Inc., the “Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner” on May 5 features special guest David Sacks — who has been helping to rewrite the country’s crypto and artificial intelligence rules. The committee receiving the funds, MAGA Inc., is a super PAC that supports Trump. But given that the president is constitutionally barred from running for a third term, it’s unclear how the PAC plans to spend the millions of dollars it is raising this spring at a series of dinners. The crypto community has cheered Sacks’ growing influence in Washington, crediting him and other Trump-aligned appointees with a sweeping policy shift that’s already delivered a spate of regulatory wins across multiple federal agencies — in what many industry executives are describing as a 180 pivot from President Joe Biden. The second gala dinner will be held later this month at Trump National, the president’s private club in the Washington, D.C., area. The guest list will be decided by a blockchain-based contest run by the creators of the $TRUMP meme token. Instead of cash, entry is based on how many tokens a user holds, with the top 220 promised dinner with Trump himself. The contest runs through May 12. The gala, which is black tie optional, offers a “VIP White House Tour” and special reception to the meme coin’s 25-biggest holders. The website hosts an active leaderboard displaying the usernames of the coin’s top buyers. Accountable.US, a center-left watchdog group that investigates corporate and political influence, described the leaderboard contest as “the most nakedly corrupt self-enrichment scheme in U.S. presidential history,” warning it opens the door for wealthy donors — including potentially foreign actors — to buy access to the president, while personally enriching the Trump family. Because crypto wallets are pseudonymous, unless a holder has publicly disclosed their wallet address, it is difficult to independently confirm the identities of the top token holders currently leading the contest. In January, for example, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun upped his token stake in another Trump-related crypto project. The Tron blockchain founder disclosed that he holds $75 million worth of World Liberty Financial’s token. A court filing the following month showed that Sun and the Securities and Exchange Commission were exploring a resolution to the regulator’s civil fraud case against the crypto entrepreneur. The fine print of the $TRUMP contest does not guarantee access to the president. According to the site’s terms and conditions, Trump may not be able to attend and the event can be canceled “for any reason.” In that case, they’ll get a Trump NFT instead. Still, the contest has supercharged demand for the coin — and lined the pockets of its creators. The $TRUMP token surged more than 50% after the gala was announced, boosting the paper value of wallets controlled by insiders and early backers. Roughly 80% of the $TRUMP token supply is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliates, according to the project’s website. Since the token launched in January, trading activity has generated more than $324 million in trading fees for insiders, Chainalysis found. These fees are generated through the token’s built-in mechanism that routes a percentage of each trade to wallets controlled by the project — wallets that, according to the website, are linked to the coin’s creators. Insiders have agreed, however, to delay cashing out their share of tokens for at least another 90 days, according to the project’s public disclosures.

Trump says he will reopen 'enlarged and rebuilt' Alcatraz prison,Alcatraz Island hasn't been used as a federal penitentiary since 1963. It had a capacity of roughly 300 people.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-says-will-reopen-enlarged-rebuilt-alcatraz-prison-rcna204743,"President Donald Trump said Sunday he will direct several federal agencies to ""reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz,"" a facility that for decades was a federal prison and is now a national park. ""REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ! For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders,"" he added. Alcatraz Island, a former military fortress and prison in San Francisco Bay, was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and over the course of 29 years housed more than 1,500 people ""deemed difficult to incarcerate elsewhere in the federal prison system,"" according to the National Park Service. According to a National Park Service study, it was initially deemed unfit to serve as a federal institution because of its small size, isolated location and lack of fresh water. However, Sanford Bates, the director of the Bureau of Prisons in 1933, later found it ""an ideal place of confinement for about 200 of the most desperate or irredeemable types."" It was formally opened as a federal penitentiary the next year. Trump suggested in his post that he'd like to restore the facility to that purpose. ""When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be,"" he wrote. The director of the Bureau of Prisons, William K. Marshall III, said in a statement that his agency ""will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President’s agenda.” “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,"" Marshall said. ""USP Alcatraz has a rich history. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice."" According to the Bureau of Prisons, the average population of Alcatraz during its use was 260 to 275. The facility never reached its capacity of 336 people, and it held less than 1% of the total federal prison population. Trump seemed to suggest the island could be used to house some undocumented immigrants he has been seeking to remove from the country, making a pointed reference in his post to ""judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals who came into our country illegally."" Trump in March sent more than 200 deportees he accused of being Venezuelan gang members to a terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, arguing his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act enabled him to do so, even though a federal judge blocked the effort. A Trump-appointed federal judge last week rejected Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members. Trump decried the judicial rulings in explaining his rationale for reopening the prison Sunday evening, describing Alcatraz as a famous ""symbol of law and order."" ""The judges, so many of these radicalized judges, they want to have trials for every single, think of it, every single person that’s in our country illegally,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday evening. ""That would mean millions of trials, and it’s just so ridiculous what’s happening."" Trump similarly announced an effort in March to detain immigrants he's seeking to deport in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, but concerns about the legality and the cost of the move have led the administration to reconsider the plan. The Bureau of Prisons operates at least 120 federal institutions and manages a population of 156,254 people. It is unclear how feasible the move is considering ongoing budget constraints at the Bureau of Prisons, which told a union representing some of its staff members in December that it planned to close several facilities. Alcatraz closed as a penitentiary in 1963, according to the Bureau of Prisons, because of expensive operating costs further heightened by the physical isolation of the island, which meant all food and supplies had to be delivered by boat. ""An estimated $3-5 million was needed just for restoration and maintenance work to keep the prison open. That figure did not include daily operating costs — Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison,"" the Bureau of Prisons wrote of the penitentiary's closing. Nearly a decade later, in 1972, Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, which included Alcatraz Island. The complex opened to the public a year later, and it has gone on to become among the most popular National Park Service sites, according to the agency, hosting more than 1 million visitors annually. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, whose district includes the island, said Trump's proposal ""is not a serious one,"" noting on X that it is now ""a major tourist attraction."" A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom also downplayed the legitimacy of the idea. “Looks like it’s distraction day again in Washington, D.C.,"" said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, Newsom's deputy director of communication.

"In New York, a GOP congressman is shelled with questions about Trump during raucous town hall","At one point, law enforcement personnel surrounded a woman in the audience and then carried her out. It was unclear what exactly led to her removal.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/new-york-gop-congressman-shelled-questions-trump-raucous-town-hall-rcna204793,"SOMERS, N.Y. — Voters in U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler’s suburban New York swing district unloaded a barrage of criticism on the Republican during a raucous town hall Sunday night, peppering him with questions around President Donald Trump’s aggressive agenda before devolving into a chaotic chorus of boos as attendees were removed by law enforcement. The town hall in Somers, a leafy section of Lawler’s Hudson Valley district, began to teeter off the rails soon after it began. The first crack emerged when Lawler, in his opening remarks, told the packed-out prep school auditorium “This is what democracy looks like.” Laughter crept through the crowd. A little while later, the congressman’s mention of federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. drew loud jeers. “So you want, for instance, petroleum-based dyes to continue?” Lawler asked in response. Republicans, in some instances, have made themselves scarce in their home districts following President Donald Trump’s first few months in office, as party leadership expresses wariness of viral blowback against Republicans in vulnerable seats. Lawler, a moderate who last year won a second term and has openly expressed interest in running for governor, has instead sought to put himself in front of voters, holding a previous town hall late last month and has plans for more in the coming weeks. On Sunday, Lawler’s staff required people to RSVP and set up a series of ground rules, including that attendees live in the district, not record at the event, refrain from shouting or standing, and “be respectful of one another, of staff, and of the Congressman,” a sign at the door read. At one point, as Lawler was responding to a question about tariffs, security and law enforcement began to surround a woman in the upper stretch of the auditorium. The crowd chanted “let her stay, let her stay” before law enforcement picked her up and carried her out. It was unclear what exactly led to her removal. “Shame! Shame! Shame!” the audience yelled. Lawler tried to get back on track: “Folks, tariffs are way more complicated than you want to make them.” The crowd groaned. “Folks, enough!” Lawler said above the din. Soon after, another person was removed. Then another. In the audience, Jeanette Spoor, a 74-year-old retiree, said she wanted to ask Lawler about the future of Social Security and Medicaid but wasn’t called on during the nearly two-hour event. “You’re not helping your constituents if you’re making it hard for them to get help,” she said in an interview. She added, “I have no hopes for this guy.” Another attendee, Kristi Thompson, 52, said she was bothered by what she said were Lawler’s long-winded answers that didn’t address the substance of the crowd’s questions. “He claims to be available to constituents, but he isn’t,” she said. The crowd walked out during the final question of the night, which was about protests against Israel. Lawler began to answer but cut himself off as the room emptied out. “I appreciate everybody coming out tonight and taking the time to ask your questions and hear my answers, whether you liked them or not, or agreed with them or not, or whether you really actually wanted to listen to them or not, but I very much appreciate you participating,” he said as attendees exited.

Mike Pence receives JFK Profile in Courage Award for Jan. 6 actions,"""By God’s grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America,” former vice president says.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/mike-pence-receives-jfk-profile-courage-award-january-6-actions-rcna204763,"BOSTON — Former Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday repeatedly invoked the Constitution and said it is what “binds us all together” after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump’s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. The award recognizes Pence “for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021,” the JFK Library Foundation said. “To forge a future together, we have to find common ground,” Pence said. “I hope in some small way my presence here tonight is a reminder that whatever differences we may have as Americans, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand. It’s what binds us across time and generations. .... It’s what makes us one people.” His comments came hours after an interview with Trump aired in which he was asked whether U.S. citizens and noncitizens both deserve due process as laid out in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Trump was noncommittal. “I don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know,” Trump said when pressed in an interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker. It was taped Friday at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida and aired Sunday. Pence never mentioned Trump during his 10-minute speech but made several references to the Trump administration. Referencing what he called “these divided times, in these anxious days,” he acknowledged that he probably had differences with the Democrats in the room but also with his own Republican Party “on spending, tariffs and my belief that America is the leader of the free world and must stand with Ukraine until the Russian invasion is repelled and a just and lasting peace is secured.” Trump pressured Pence to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president falsely claimed the vote was marred by fraud. Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority. When a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to “hang Mike Pence.” Pence was whisked away by Secret Service agents, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the rioters. “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,” Trump wrote at the time on X, formerly Twitter, as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building. Pence rejected the Secret Service’s advice that he leave the Capitol, staying to continue the ceremonial election certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential victory once rioters were cleared. In describing his role, Pence told the audience that “by God’s grace I did my duty that day to support the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America.” “Jan. 6 was a tragic day but it became a triumph of freedom. History will record that our institutions held,” he said in his speech. “Leaders in both chambers, in both political parties reconvened the very same day and finished democracy’s work under the Constitution.” JFK’s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, who along with his grandson Jack Schlossberg presented the award, said Pence’s actions that day were a reminder that democracy must not be taken for granted. “At the time I thought Vice President Pence was just doing his job,” she said. “Only later did I realize that his act of courage saved our government and warned us about what could happen and is happening right now.” The Profile in Courage Award, named for a book Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president, honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences. Previous recipients of the award include former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford. Pence has emerged as one of the few Republicans willing to take on the Trump administration. His political action group, Advancing American Freedom, campaigned against the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation’s health agencies. He’s delivered speeches urging the president to stand with longtime foreign allies and posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” The Associated Press",The Associated Press,"May 5, 2025, 6:30 AM GMT+2 / Updated May 5, 2025, 6:59 AM GMT+2 / Source: The Associated Press"
Trump announces plans for 100% tariffs on all foreign movies,The president said the new import penalties are an effort to spur the production of feature films in America and revitalize Hollywood.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-announces-new-tariffs-foreign-movies-rcna204747,"President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to implement a 100% tariff on movies made in other countries that are imported to the United States, decrying other nations for offering financial incentives meant to “draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.” ""Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to foreign films as ""messaging and propaganda."" ""I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,"" he continued. Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday that ""other nations have been stealing the movies, the moviemaking capabilities from the United States,"" blaming California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the decline in film production in Hollywood specifically over the last several years. A spokesman for Newsom did not respond to a request for comment Sunday night. ""If they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States, we should have a tariff when movies come in,"" Trump said. ""I can tell you one thing, moviemakers love it."" The American film industry has suffered a series of economic blows in recent years, including the Hollywood labor strikes and the Covid-19 pandemic. Physical production has declined in California amid budget cuts and more generous tax incentives elsewhere. FilmLA, a nonprofit organization that coordinates film permits and supports on-location production in the Los Angeles region, reported lower-than-average soundstage occupancy in recent years. The report notes that competing jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Ontario, Canada, have more than doubled their stage production capacity over the last years, alongside other U.S. states, such as New York and Georgia. However, while overall production was down in Los Angeles, the report found that the production of feature films specifically was up 18.8% last year, though the category is still well below its five-year average. ""Unfortunately for all involved, fewer film, television and commercial projects in production makes it harder to fill studio vacancies,"" the report read. Trump appointed actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone as special ambassadors to Hollywood in January, calling the industry a “great but very troubled place."" Their job, Trump said at the time, was to bring business back to Hollywood, which he said ""has lost much business over the last four years to foreign countries."" Last month, Voight’s manager, Steven Paul, confirmed to NBC News that he and Voight intended to present Trump with a suite of ideas to ramp up American film and television production. It is unclear whether that meeting has occurred. The Motion Picture Association, a trade organization that represents Hollywood’s leading studios, declined to comment. In a recent economic report based on U.S. government data, the MPA found that Hollywood has a positive trade balance in all the world’s major markets. NBC News did not immediately receive responses to requests for comment from Paul; Cinema United, a trade group that represents movie theaters; and several distributors that release foreign-made films, including Netflix. China announced new tariffs on Hollywood films imported into the country about a month ago, though Reuters reports the move was unlikely to have a significant financial impact on Hollywood given steadily declining box office returns from China.

"CIA's top doctor sues over her firing, accusing the government of bowing to the far right","Dr. Terry Adirim, director of the CIA’s Center for Global Health Services, accused the government of denying her due process and bowing to far-right activists.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/cias-top-doctor-suing-agency-firing-lawsuit-says-rcna204656,"The CIA’s former top-ranking doctor is suing it over her firing, accusing the government of denying her due process and bowing to far right activists who singled her out for criticism. The CIA hired Dr. Terry Adirim, director of the CIA’s Center for Global Health Services, after she served as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Just days after Adirim started her job at the CIA last year, far-right commentator Ivan Raiklin accused her of being the “architect” of the Defense Department’s vaccine mandate, which required members of the military to get the Covid-19 vaccine. The lawsuit alleges that Adirim’s hiring at the CIA had not yet been announced publicly and that someone inside the government leaked the information to Raiklin. Raiklin, a former Green Beret who has called himself the “secretary of retribution,” has been an intense critic of the Covid-19 vaccines, calling them “DNA-mutilation injections.” He has demanded retaliation against Pentagon officials who he says were involved in requiring service members to get the Covid-19 vaccines. Raiklin is associated with Michael Flynn, who was briefly President Donald Trump’s national security adviser at the start of his first term. The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adirim was fired only weeks after she received an email from the CIA’s chief operating officer saying the CIA “looked forward to investing in her career,” according to the lawsuit. That was also two days after Lara Loomer, another far-right conspiracy theorist, paid a visit to the White House and urged that several national security officials be dismissed for alleged disloyalty, according to the lawsuit. Loomer later took credit for the abrupt firing of the director of the National Security Agency, four-star Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, as well as its civilian deputy. “We’re suing CIA to enjoin the Agency from firing Dr. Adirim, and seeking damages for violating her privacy, ignoring her due process rights, and breaching her employment contract,” Adirim’s lawyer, Kevin Carroll, said in a statement. Carroll says in the lawsuit that he will seek to prove through discovery that Raiklin worked with Loomer to secure Adirim’s dismissal.

Trump says he'll call CEOs when he disagrees with their business decisions,Retailers have increasingly offered warnings about the tariffs' impact on consumers.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-call-ceos-plans-prices-tariffs-rcna204702,"President Donald Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that he’d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary. The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was going to begin to list tariff charges on certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to impose 145% tariffs on China. ""He’s just a very nice guy,"" Trump said of Bezos in an interview that aired Sunday. ""We have a relationship. I asked him about [the tariff charge language Amazon considered including in listings]. He said, 'Well, I don’t want to do that,' and he took it off immediately."" Trump and Bezos appear to have developed a closer relationship in the last few months than they had during Trump’s first administration. In December, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Bezos attended his swearing-in ceremony. Bezos stepped down as the company's CEO in 2021, but he is still its executive chairman. Indeed, in a statement shortly after the Punchbowl report, an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News, ""The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen.” Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: ""Sure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them."" ""If I think that somebody’s doing something that’s incorrect, wrong or maybe hurtful to the country, I’ll call,"" he added. ""Wouldn’t you want me to call? [Former President Joe] Biden wouldn’t call because he didn’t know what was happening, but I do."" In the interview, Trump defended his decision to impose major tariffs on imports from China, saying the move is supposed to give companies incentives to build factories in the United States to avoid paying tariffs, not simply raise prices on consumers to offset the cost of tariffs. ""I don’t view it as a tax. I view it as an incentive for people to come into the United States and build plants, factories, offices, a lot of things. I think it’s an incentive,"" he told Welker. ""What people don’t understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. The company eats the tariff. And it’s not passed along at all,"" he added. Several other major online retailers, like Temu, a low-cost retail site based in China, have already begun charging consumers tariff fees, adding a line item on purchases that's listed as “import charges.” Other popular American retailers, like Béis, Bare Necessities and Fashion Nova, have urged consumers to shop more in the near term, predicting that imposing future tariffs could force them to raise prices. Larger companies, like PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, have issued similar warnings, telling shareholders in recent meetings that they're already seeing the impacts of tariffs on earnings. Trump has acknowledged that tariffs could have an impact on the availability of consumer goods in the near term. Asked whether his remark about children having fewer toys during a Cabinet meeting was an acknowledgment that tariffs would cause prices to rise, Trump told Welker: ""I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls, because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable."" Trump made a similar remark at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, telling members of his administration: ""Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” But he pushed back against the assertion that he was predicting price hikes or supply shortages due to tariffs. ""I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,"" he said, adding, ""we don’t have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don’t need, for junk that we don’t need.""

Trump defends the high price tag for his military parade: 'Peanuts compared to the value',"In an exclusive interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Trump also outlined a White House renovation he hopes to carry out — which he said he will pay for himself.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-defends-high-cost-military-parade-peanuts-rcna204581,"President Donald Trump told NBC News he plans to hold several events to celebrate U.S. military victories this year, including a “big, beautiful” military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate Flag Day, which also happens to fall on his birthday. “My birthday happens to be on Flag Day,” Trump told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker in a wide-ranging interview at Mar-a-Lago that aired on Sunday. “I view it for Flag Day, not necessarily my birthday. Somebody put it together. But no, I think we’re going to do something on June 14 maybe or somewhere around there. But I think June 14. It’s a very important day.” The parade won’t be cheap. Defense officials told NBC News that the estimated cost could be as high as $45 million, with individual Army units ultimately bearing the cost of the parade — which could potentially impact funds used for training. Trump said it would be worth it. “Peanuts compared to the value of doing it,” Trump said of the cost. “We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we’re going to celebrate it.” The event, which will also mark the Army’s 250th birthday, is expected to include 6,600 soldiers, an Army spokesman said. Defense officials familiar with the planning said it is also expected to feature more than 50 aircraft and 150 military vehicles, which could include wheeled vehicles such as Humvees and trucks, and so-called tracked vehicles, like tanks. The military parade is just one of several events Trump said he intends to host this year to mark America’s wartime achievements. Trump said he was inspired after speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron about Victory Day celebrations in Europe commemorating the end of World War II. He said he was considering celebrations on separate days to commemorate the end of the two world wars. Recounting a past conversation with Macron, Trump recalled saying, ""'We had more to do with winning World War II than any other nation. Why don’t we have a Victory Day?' So we’re going to have a Victory Day for World War I and for World War II."" “You know, if you look at Russia, they celebrate Victory Day,” he had previously noted. “I think you can have two days,” Trump said. “This doesn’t mean we’re going to go and not work and have a national holiday and all of that, because we don’t have many of those days left. You know, eventually our country will become all national holidays.” When Welker pressed for more details on these celebrations, Trump pivoted back to talking about Flag Day and didn’t get into specifics. The U.S. officially claims Nov. 11, 1918, the day an armistice agreement was signed with Germany, as the end of World War I. Sept. 2, 1945, when the U.S. accepted Japan’s surrender, is the date recorded as the end of World War II. Trump also revealed his plans to remodel the White House, starting by replacing grass in the Rose Garden with a “beautiful stone surface.” “We had the prime minister of India here, and they had a lot of press, and the women were walking out with their shoes full of mud. So we can’t have that,” Trump said. The renovations will also include an effort to build a ballroom in the East Wing of the White House using existing meeting rooms. It would be used in part to host world leaders. “You know, when they have a party for, like, when the head of China comes in, or the head of anybody, you know, head of anything,” Trump said, “they have a party where they have a tent 200 yards away, where people have to walk in the rain to get to a tent. And that’s not for us. That’s not for the United States of America.” Trump noted that he built a ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago property and said his background as a real estate developer makes him uniquely equipped to carry out the White House renovation. He told Welker he plans to fund the effort himself. “Yeah, I’m not going to ask the government for money. I’ll fund it, and I’m sure we’ll have some donations to it. But it’s not an inexpensive thing. It’ll cost a lot of money,” Trump said, adding that “it will be something really beautiful, top of the line.” Nnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.",Nnamdi Egwuonwu,"May 4, 2025, 3:00 PM GMT+2 / Updated May 4, 2025, 10:37 PM GMT+2"
