Lady Gaga says she was unaware of thwarted bomb threat until learning about it from media,"Unidentified people were “virtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks” to gain online notoriety, according to the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/planned-bombing-lady-gaga-rio-de-janiero-rcna204698,"A planned bombing at a Lady Gaga concert in Brazil on Saturday night was foiled and a suspect is in custody, Brazilian authorities said. Unidentified people were “virtually recruiting participants to carry out attacks” using improvised explosive devices, the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police said. The perpetrators planned to gain notoriety on social networks through the bombing, authorities said. The person accused of being responsible for the plan is in custody, and a teenager has been detained in connection with the matter, police said. Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security alleged in a statement that the plot was organized by a larger extremist network that operates online to radicalize adolescents and provoke hate crimes. It's unclear when authorities found out about the threat. The civil police intelligence unit was first alerted to the scheme, and search and seizure warrants were obtained for multiple areas in Brazil, police said. A spokesperson for Lady Gaga said her team learned about the alleged threat through media reports Sunday morning. “Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,” the spokesperson said. “Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.” Lady Gaga singer posted about the show on her Instagram account Sunday, praising the crowd for their vibrancy throughout it. ""I wish I could share this feeling with the whole world—I know I can’t, but I can say this—if you lose your way, you can find your way back if you believe in yourself and work hard,"" Gaga wrote. She did not address the alleged bombing threat. Lady Gaga played at the famed Copacabana venue as part of her new “Mayhem” tour. She announced the show in February on Instagram, saying she was excited to return after having had to cancel her last show in Brazil because of a hip injury during her “Born This Way Ball” tour. She added that she was “dying to come perform” for her Brazilian “little monsters,” which is the nickname for Lady Gaga fans. The free concert Saturday was attended by 2.5 million people, according to concert organizers. It is the largest attendance for a female artist, the organizers said, beating Madonna's draw of 1.6 million people at the Copacabana Beach last year. It falls shy of the Guinness World Record for the largest free concert, which was also at the beach venue. Rod Stewart's performance at the Copacabana in 1994 for New Year's Eve brought in an estimated 3.5 million revelers. Rio’s security plan included 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers and 400 military firefighters. The show was supported by the local government in hope of boosting economic activity between big events in Rio, such as Carnival and next month's Saint John’s Day celebrations. More than 500,000 tourists flocked to the city to see Lady Gaga, Rio’s City Hall said in a statement on Friday. Taylor Swift was forced to cancel her shows in Vienna because of a security threat less than a year ago. Austrian authorities said they were alerted to plans to bomb Swift's Eras Tour performances in the city in a terrorism-related attack. Swift opted to cancel the concerts and waited until the end of her European leg of the tour. “Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,” Swift said weeks later. “The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.” Swift had expressed anxiety about keeping people safe during her live performances, citing the 2017 bombing at Ariana Grande's concert in Manchester, England, and the 2017 music festival shooting in Las Vegas.

"Ruth Buzzi, comedy sketch player on groundbreaking series 'Laugh-In,' dies at 88",Buzzi rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In.”,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/ruth-buzzi-comedy-sketch-player-groundbreaking-series-laugh-dies-88-rcna204459,"LOS ANGELES — Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In” and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died at age 88. Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, says her agent Mike Eisenstadt. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband, Kent Perkins, had posted a statement on Buzzi’s Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: “She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.” Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot. She was first spotted by “Laugh-In” creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on “The Steve Allen Comedy Hour.” Schlatter was holding auditions for “Laugh-In” when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead. “I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,” he wrote in his 2023 memoir “Still Laughing A Life in Comedy.” “I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.” The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On “Laugh-In,” her most frequent target was Arte Johnson’s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh. “Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,” Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. “So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who’s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that’s almost everyone at some time or other.” Buzzi took her act to the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in Las Vegas, where she bashed her purse on the heads of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Lucille Ball, among others. Her other recurring characters on “Laugh-In” included Flicker Farkle; Busy-Buzzi, a Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge regular who got drunk with husband Leonard, played by Dick Martin; and an inconsiderate flight attendant. “I never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,” Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. “I was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.” Buzzi remained friends through the years with “Laugh-In” co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley. Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school. Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors’ Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse’s College of Theatre Arts. Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast. She got her national television break on “The Garry Moore Show” in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician’s assistant to Dom DeLuise’s character Dominic the Great. Buzzi was a regular on the CBS variety show “The Entertainers” whose hosts included Burnett and Bob Newhart. She was in the original Broadway cast of “Sweet Charity” with Gwen Verdon in 1966. Buzzi toured the country with her nightclub act, including appearances in Las Vegas. She was a semi-regular on “That Girl” as Marlo Thomas’ friend. She co-starred with Jim Nabors as time-traveling androids on “The Lost Saucer” in the mid-1970s. Her other guest appearances included variety shows hosted by Burnett, Flip Wilson, Glen Campbell, Tony Orlando, Donny and Marie Osmond and Leslie Uggams. She appeared in Ball’s last comedy series “Life With Lucy.” Buzzi guested in music videos with “Weird Al” Yankovic, the B-52’s and the Presidents of the United States of America. She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including “Pound Puppies,” “Berenstain Bears,” “The Smurfs” and “The Angry Beavers.” She was Emmy nominated for her six-year run as shopkeeper Ruthie on “Sesame Street.” Her movie credits included “Freaky Friday,” “Chu Chu and the Philly Flash,” “The North Avenue Irregulars” and “The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.” Buzzi was active on social media and had thousands of followers whom she rewarded with such one-liners as “I have never faked a sarcasm” and “Scientists say the universe is made up entirely of neurons, protons and electrons. They seem to have missed morons.” She married actor Kent Perkins in 1978. The couple moved from California to Texas in 2003 and bought a 640-acre ranch near Stephenville. Buzzi retired from acting in 2021 and suffered a series of strokes the following year. Her husband told The Dallas Morning News in 2023 that she had dementia.",The Associated Press,"May 2, 2025, 5:43 PM GMT+2 / Updated May 2, 2025, 6:01 PM GMT+2 / Source: The Associated Press"
Blake Lively said past year filled with 'lowest lows' of her life amid legal battle with Justin Baldoni,"The “Another Simple Favor” star talked about her ""intense"" year during a recent Seth Meyers appearance.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/blake-lively-said-year-filled-lowest-lows-life-legal-battle-justin-bal-rcna204438,"Blake Lively is speaking out about what she’s going through. The “Another Simple Favor” star made an appearance on the May 1 episode of “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and spoke about the highs and lows she’d experienced. Host Seth Meyers first mentioned to Lively that he was “not totally informed” about the details of what she said was an “intense” year. “I’m thrilled you’re not doing ‘Weekend Update’ right now, because you’d be totally informed,” Lively joked. Meyers followed with a prompt to see what Lively was willing to share. “But were I to ask you about it I’d imagine you’re in a situation where you can’t say much,” he said. Lively characterized using her “voice” as a fight to “make the world safer for women in girls.” “What I can say without going too into it is that this year has been full of the highest highs and the lowest lows of my life. I see so many women around afraid to speak, afraid to share their experiences. Fear is by design. It’s what keeps us silent,"" she said. ""I acknowledge that many people don’t have the opportunity to speak,"" Lively continued. ""I feel fortunate that I have been able to. It’s the women who have had the ability to use their voice that have kept me strong and have helped me in my fight to make the world safer for women and girls. It’s a pretty simple thing,” she said. Following her comments, Lively received a round of applause from the audience. It should be noted that Lively or Meyers made no specific mention of her legal case involving Justin Baldoni and their film “It Ends With Us.” Back in January, a New York judge announced that both Lively and Baldoni’s lawsuits against each other would be addressed in a trial set for March 9, 2026. Lively starred and produced “It Ends With Us,” while Baldoni directed and co-starred. The film premiered in August 2024, yet before its release, people began speculating that there was tension between the cast. By December 2024, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, with her attorneys stating that, in multiple incidents, Baldoni harassed Lively on set and crossed boundaries during intimate scenes, according to an administrative complaint filed Dec. 20, 2024 and obtained by TODAY.com. Attorneys for Baldoni denied the accusations at the time. On Dec. 31, Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, seeking $250 million in damages, over the newspaper’s coverage of Lively’s accusations of sexual harassment and being the target of a smear campaign. Also on Dec. 31, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni’s publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and “It Ends With Us,” in which her legal team argued she had been a victim of sexual harassment and a smear campaign, according to court documents obtained by NBC News. In response, in January 2025, Baldoni sued Lively, accusing her, her husband Ryan Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloane and Sloane’s PR firm of defamation and other contractual claims. In a statement to NBC News in Jan. 16, 2025, Lively’s legal team said the lawsuit was “another chapter in the abuser playbook,” denying the allegations. Baldoni and his team would go on to create a website about the lawsuit against Lively, filled with their complaint and alleged emails and texts from those involved in the creation of “It Ends With Us.” Lively’s By February, the judge overseeing their trial didn’t restrict what their attorneys could say publicly but he did issue a warning about public comments, according to NBC News. Later that month, Lively amended her original complaint, alleging that other women had complained about Baldoni’s misconduct, as well as added a new claim for defamation. Attorneys for Baldoni did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News about Lively’s amended complaint at the time.","Liz Calvario, TODAY","May 2, 2025, 5:02 PM GMT+2 / Source: TODAY"
"Singer Jill Sobule, known for 'I Kissed a Girl,' dies in house fire",Sobule was 66. The 1995 song was the first openly queer-themed record to reach Billboard’s Top 20.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/jill-sobule-kissed-girl-dies-fire-rcna204334,"Singer Jill Sobule, known for the 1995 song “I Kissed a Girl,” died in a Minnesota house fire Thursday morning, her representatives said. She was 66. The fire occurred in Woodbury, a city around 16 miles east of Minneapolis, they said. Officials there said firefighters discovered a dead woman after a house fire that was reported around 5:30 a.m. Thursday. “Jill Sobule was a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture,” manager John Porter said in a statement. ""I Kissed a Girl” reached No. 20 on Billboard’s modern rock chart, the first openly queer-themed record to do so. Sobule’s song “Supermodel” from the “Clueless” soundtrack was also a pop success. Sobule most recently created a coming-of-age musical, ""F--- 7th Grade,"" an off-Broadway show that debuted in 2022. It was a Drama Desk nominee for ""outstanding musical"" the next year and was named a New York Times Critic Pick. Sobule had been scheduled to perform Friday in Denver at Swallow Hill, where an informal gathering will now be held to remember her, instead, her reps said. In 2008, Katy Perry released “I Kissed a Girl,” which was not a cover of Sobule's song. After Sobule made comments that she said were deliberately over the top and ironic, she was targeted by Perry fans who took the comments seriously. “I may be a touch cynical about the business, but I have never really been angry or had ill feelings towards Katy herself,” Sobule wrote on what was then known as The Huffington Post. “I was actually in a small way happy to not be the ‘Kissed a Girl’ girl anymore.” She said she hoped Perry fans were “okay with the title of my brand new song, ‘I Kissed a Girl ...First,’” she wrote, adding “Wink.” Sobule is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, James and Mary Ellen Sobule, and her nephews, Ian Matthew and Robert, and Robert’s wife, Irina, her reps said.

George Lucas finally explains why Yoda speaks backward in ‘Star Wars’ films,His style of speech is intentional.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/george-lucas-explains-why-yoda-speaks-backwards-star-wars-films-rcna203784,"Know now do we why speaks that way does Yoda. “Star Wars” creator George Lucas is peeling back the curtain on why Yoda speaks backwards in the film franchise. “Yoda had a very distinctive way of talking, and it was done purposely because if you were speaking regular English, people don’t listen that much, but if he has an accent, or it’s really hard to understand what he’s saying, they focus on what he’s saying,” he told Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz last week during a screening of “The Empire Strikes Back” at the TCM Classic Film Festival. “He was basically the philosopher of the movie, so he was talking about all of the things in long talking scenes and stuff where I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen, especially 12-year-olds.” Yoda is known for his wisdom, with such lines as “Try not. Do or do not. There is no try,” “The greatest teacher, failure is” and “Much to learn, you still have.” Yoda’s first appearance in the “Star Wars” franchise came in 1980 in “The Empire Strikes Back.” The character was voiced by Frank Oz, who also provided it for “Return of the Jedi,” the prequel trilogy and “The Last Jedi.” He and other actors have also voiced Yoda in various related “Star Wars” projects over the years. Oz said he came up with Yoda’s unusual speaking style before getting Lucas’ blessing to do it. “I was just looking at the original script of ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ the other day and there was a bit of that odd syntax in it, but also it had Yoda speaking very colloquially,” he told The Guardian in 2021. “So I said to George (Lucas): ‘Can I do the whole thing like this?’ And he said: ‘Sure!’ It just felt so right.” Oz also said he doesn’t get tired of people doing impressions of Yoda, either. “No I’m used to it. But people don’t understand, anyone can do a voice. It’s not the voice — it’s the soul,” he said. A new “Star Wars” film is due out in 2027. Earlier this month, the movie’s director, Shawn Levy, revealed that Ryan Gosling will star in it.","Drew Weisholtz, TODAY","April 30, 2025, 6:17 PM GMT+2 / Updated May 1, 2025, 3:56 AM GMT+2 / Source: TODAY"

King Charles opens up about cancer diagnosis and treatment,"The British monarch, who was diagnosed with cancer in February 2024, has kept the details of his disease private.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/united-kingdom/king-charles-opens-cancer-diagnosis-treatment-rcna203812,"LONDON — King Charles III opened up Wednesday about the lessons he has learned from his cancer diagnosis and treatment, an experience that he said ""brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity."" Speaking at a Buckingham Palace celebration of community-based initiatives raising cancer awareness and supporting those living with the disease, Charles said that ""each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening experience for those individuals and their loved ones."" ""It has certainly given me an even deeper appreciation of the extraordinary work undertaken by the remarkable organizations and individuals gathered here this evening, many of whom I have known, visited and supported over the years,"" he said. ""And it has reinforced what I have long observed during these visits — that the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion."" Charles thanked the health care professionals providing cancer treatment, saying that ""they have my whole family’s deepest admiration and gratitude"" and that their care ""represents the very best our country can offer."" ""What strikes us repeatedly is the profound impact of human connection — whether in the careful explanation from a specialist nurse, the hand held by a hospice volunteer or the shared experience in a support group,"" he said. ""These moments of kinship create what I might call a 'community of care,' one that sustains patients through the most difficult of times."" Charles was diagnosed with cancer in February 2024. He has kept much of his dealings with the disease, including what type of cancer he has or the stage of the disease, private. Most recently, he was hospitalized last month because of side effects from his treatment, according to Buckingham Palace. Charles was diagnosed last year just weeks before news that Princess Kate, 43, was undergoing ""preventative chemotherapy,"" piling on to shock waves about the British monarchy around the world. About 20 million cancer cases were newly diagnosed, and 9.7 million people died from the disease worldwide in 2022, according to the most recent global statistics from the American Cancer Society.

De Niro, 29, spoke to Them, an LGBTQ magazine owned by Condé Nast, about feeling she was out of place. De Niro, whose mother is Toukie Smith, described herself as a ""late bloomer"" who failed to fit in with societal standards growing up. ""I was always told I was too much of something or not enough of something growing up: Too big, not skinny enough,"" she told the magazine. ""Not Black enough, not white enough. Too feminine, not masculine enough. It was never just, ‘You’re just right, just the way you are.’” She credited the stories of openly transgender women — including Laverne Cox and queer activist Marsha P. Johnson — with inspiring her to embrace her femininity last year. ""Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media and getting to see them in their success ... I’m like, you know what? Maybe it’s not too late for me,” she said. She added that as she has embraced her gender identity, she has also been influenced by Black women and has been able to embrace her Black ancestry. One of the first outward expressions of her gender identity, she said, was deciding to get dreadlocks after she saw Halle Bailey in the 2023 live-action film ""The Little Mermaid."" Despite being the child of two actors, De Niro credited her parents for doing their best to shield her from the public eye throughout her childhood. Her father was also insistent that she forge her own career path, she said. She expressed her gratitude for that upbringing while also saying she wants to be public now to give others someone to aspire to. And in a time when civil rights for transgender people are being targeted, she said she is studying to be a mental health counselor to aid the community.

Christie Brinkley recalls Billy Joel’s 7-word response to her writing a memoir,The model and author of “Uptown Girl” opens up about her marriage to the iconic musician.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/christie-brinkley-memoir-billy-joel-marriage-rcna203780,"Christie Brinkley, one of the most recognizable faces in modeling, offers a revealing glimpse into the challenges of being one of the world’s original supermodels in her new memoir, “Uptown Girl.” Gracing the cover of more than 500 magazines and appearing in memorable movies like the 1983 hit film, “National Lampoon’s Vacation,” Brinkley’s career spans five decades, and she delves into much of it in her new book. “I just want to tell some stories,” Brinkley tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. “I hope it’ll be a nice diversion in a world that can use a good book every now and then, take you away on a little adventure.” From being discovered at a payphone in Paris to being kicked out of Frank Sinatra’s hotel room, “Uptown Girl” offers insight behind Brinkley’s upbringing in Southern California and her ascent to the top of the modeling world. The book also explores her four marriages (and divorces), including 11 years she spent with Billy Joel. It’s the music legend who penned “Uptown Girl,” the song that inspired the memoir’s title, which has become Brinkley’s enduring nickname — in spite of the fact that, according to the supermodel, it wasn’t initially written for her. Brinkley writes in her memoir that it started out as a song for a “mystery girl” Joel had been having phone conversations with, but when his relationship with Brinkley began, he finished it in her honor. Their relationship was then immortalized in the hit song’s iconic music video, in which Brinkley appears in. In “Uptown Girl,” Brinkley, 71, opens up about her various heartbreaks, difficult early childhood with an abusive father and the helicopter accident that almost claimed her life in 1994. However, the model says that opening up about her marriage to Joel was the most difficult part of penning the memoir. “The hardest thing to include was criticism of Billy, because I do care about my friendship with him,” she says of the chapters that reveal Joel’s heavy drinking and suggested affairs, which has been making headlines since her book came out. “In the book, I feel like I balanced, very much, about how happy we were and how joy-filled our days were,” she says of their marriage. “It was literally dancing in the kitchen as we cooked, singing together, and making each other laugh. It was a beautiful, wonderful relationship.” According to the memoir, that relationship became strained, in part, after Joel sued Frank Weber, his former manager, for having allegedly siphoned off his profits. It was a betrayal that Brinkley writes left Joel “withdrawn and stressed” as singer-songwriter felt immense pressure to recoup his financial loss. “He was going through extraordinary circumstances in his life, things most people wouldn’t ever have to deal with,” she describes. Despite the vulnerable nature of the admissions, Brinkley says they were important to include in the memoir. “I did have to go there because that was the reality.” Brinkley tells TODAY.com that Joel had given his blessing to talk candidly about the ups and downs of their longtime relationship. “He said, ‘Just say what you need to say,’” Brinkley recalls. “And I think that’s part of his healing, so I applaud him for all of that. It takes a lot of courage.” The new memoir reveals some darker times in their relationship, including instances of Brinkley waking up in the middle of the night to discover Joel was missing, then him returning home in the wee hours of the morning after being out drinking all night. She also writes about the growing distance in their marriage that ultimately left her feeling “lonely, despite the fact that he was right there.” It was a loneliness so pervasive that Brinkley was thinking about Joel as she boarded a helicopter in Colorado, shortly after their separation in 1994, and wondered if the crooner would be worried about her embarking on a trip to go heli-skiing. “For a moment I thought about my husband, Billy, whom I’d split with again, and hoping this trip to Telluride would wake him up to the reality that he might actually lose me,” she writes. What she didn’t know was that shortly after, the helicopter would crash into the San Juan mountains, leaving Brinkley and several companions temporarily stranded until they were rescued. Though Joel ultimately flew to her side and jetted her back to Long Island aboard a private plane, her dream of their reunion was dashed when she overheard him on the phone saying to an unknown caller, ‘No, don’t worry. I’m not going back to her. I just need to see her through this.’” The revelation brought home the fact that their marriage was over. Two weeks later, they announced their divorce and as she penned in her memoir, “the dream broke apart like debris.” Despite their divorce, Brinkley tells TODAY.com that they still remain friends. “He’s a very loyal guy. He’s loyal to his friends, he’s generous. He just had a lot of stresses on him at the point when we were together and it just kind of came crashing down on us.” Outside of her marriage, the helicopter crash changed her life in other ways. “I went through a phase of post-traumatic stress disorder,” she says of the accident that left her clinging to the side of a mountain amid a pile of helicopter wreckage. “One of the hallmarks is bad decision-making. And I made quite a few, which I lay out in the book and that chapter was hard to write just because I didn’t want to think about any of (the helicopter crash). I didn’t want to go back to that place. At the time when it happened, I actually thought it was so awful, I wanted to purge it from my body and from my memory banks.” While she’s endured her fair share of trauma, Brinkley remains the eternal optimist, both in love and life. “I was raised in a very positive household, so I was raised to be grateful and counting my blessings and to know the good things that I have, no matter what,” she says. Among those blessings are Brinkley’s three children: Alexa Ray Joel, 39, her daughter with Joel, as well as her son, Jack Brinkley-Cook, 29, and other daughter, Sailor Brinkley-Cook, 26, both of whom she shares with her ex-husband Peter Cook. While appearing on the April 28 episode of ""TODAY,"" Brinkley shared that out of her three children, her oldest daughter is the one who’s read most of her memoir and that she loves it. “She was kind of blown away by it,” said Brinkley. As for the other two, the model joked that her younger children “skimmed through” it and said, “We know her!” but otherwise, “I don’t think they understand the reason to read it.” Though Brinkley has released two other books, including a 1983 fitness book and “Timeless Beauty,” a wellness guide published in 2015, “Uptown Girl” is her first memoir, and she wants readers to take something positive away from her experiences. “I just really hope people understand that the book is much more than rehashing divorces,” she explains, referring to her other marriages to Jean-Francois Allaux, Richard Taubman and Cook, all of which ended in divorce. “This is not a revenge novel. It’s filled with joy and when there are bad moments, it’s sort of how to keep going and not let them pull you down,” she says. “And how to stay positive and maybe learn something from it or let it propel you into someplace that you didn’t dare go before.”","Sarah Lemire, TODAY","April 30, 2025, 6:19 PM GMT+2 / Source: TODAY"
"Katy Perry says online critics are trying to make her a 'human piñata' following tour, space flight","“Please know I am ok,” the singer told her fans.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/katy-perry-responds-online-critics-space-flight-rcna203779,"Katy Perry wrote a long response to a fan-made ad congratulating her for finishing the first week of her “Lifetimes” tour, amid backlash about the tour and her recent trip to space. Perry responded to a video of the ad posted to a fan account on Instagram, writing in a comment that she is able to remain true to herself, “heart open and honest,” because of the bond she has with her fans. “Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,” she said. “My therapist said something years ago that has been a game changer, ‘No one can make you believe something about yourself that you don’t already believe about yourself,’ and if I ever do have any feelings about it then it’s an opportunity to investigate the feeling underneath it. “When the ‘online’ world tries to make me a human Piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed,” she continued. Perry said that what is real to her is seeing her fans in the crowd every night, “singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth.” “I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that,” she said, adding an infinity emoji. “I’m not perfect, and I actually have omitted that word from my vocabulary, I’m on a human journey playing the game of life with an audience of many and sometimes I fall but… I get back up and go on and continue to play the game and somehow through my battered and bruised adventure I keep looking to the light and in that light a new level UNLOCKS,” she added. Perry’s comment came after her “Lifetimes” tour began on April 23 in Mexico City. The singer has since faced criticism for the show’s choreography and stage design from social media users online. Earlier this month, Perry was also part of the all-female flight crew that took a roughly 10-minute trip to space aboard a Blue Origin spacecraft. The flight quickly garnered controversy, as everyday people, fast-food companies and celebrities, like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski, questioned the sustainability of a trip to space. “What’s the point?” Munn said while co-hosting TODAY With Jenna & Friends on April 3. “Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it’s a bit gluttonous. ... Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they going to do up there that has made it better for us down here?” Perry did not directly respond to the criticism of the flight, but several of her fellow crew members like Lauren Sanchez, Gayle King and Aisha Bowe did during a press conference on April 14. “I’m not going to let you steal our joy, but most people are really excited and cheering us on and realize what this mission means to young women, young girls and boys, too,” King said. “I feel anybody that’s criticizing doesn’t really understand what is happening here,” she added, later in the press conference. “I’ve heard it, we’ve all heard it and we were even all talking about that, and I hope that they will do a deep dive into what this represents.” Sanchez, the fiancée of Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, also shared her perspective. “I get really fired up a little bit on this,” Sanchez said. “I would love to have them come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees that don’t just work here but they put their heart and soul into this vehicle. ... They love their work and they love the mission and it’s a big deal for them.” “So when we hear comments like that, I just say, ‘Trust me. Come with me. I’ll show you what this is about, and it’s really eye-opening,’” she continued.","Anna Kaplan, TODAY","April 30, 2025, 6:06 PM GMT+2 / Source: TODAY"
Michael Bolton reveals glioblastoma diagnosis: ‘You find out what you’re made of’,The singer learned he had the incurable brain cancer in 2023.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/michael-bolton-reveals-glioblastoma-diagnosis-find-re-made-rcna203765,"Michael Bolton is sharing new details about a somber health diagnosis he’s been navigating over the last year and a half. In a new interview with People, the singer revealed that he has glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer that the Cleveland Clinic defines as the “most common type of malignant (cancerous) brain tumor in adults.” Bolton, 72, said he initially learned that he had glioblastoma in December 2023. The diagnosis came after the singer underwent emergency surgery where doctors removed a brain tumor. One month later, Bolton underwent a second brain surgery in January 2024 following an infection. At the time, he took to Facebook to tell his fans he was taking a break from touring while he recovered from the surgery. Per the Mayo Clinic, there is no cure for glioblastoma but treatments can “slow cancer growth and reduce symptoms.” The disease can occur at any age, but often manifests in older adults. The Cleveland Clinic notes that glioblastoma “can result in death in fewer than six months without treatment.” In October 2024, Bolton wrapped up radiation and chemotherapy. As part of his treatment plan, he now gets an MRI every two months to make sure his tumor hasn’t returned. While reflecting on his cancer journey thus far, Bolton said it has taken a toll both emotionally and physically. For instance, treatment has affected his short-term memory, mobility and speech. “You’re reaching into your resources and your resolve in a way that you never would have thought,” Bolton said. “Succumbing to the challenge is not an option. You’re really quickly drawn into a duel. I guess that’s the way you find out what you’re made of.” The singer said his family has provided plenty of support while he navigates his diagnosis. He also keeps busy working with a personal trainer and voice therapist. “Whenever you find yourself in any kind of challenging position, just to know that you’re not alone going through it is a big deal,” he said. “It actually helps people to know. It reminds them that they’re not alone.” Bolton said he intentionally has avoided asking for a prognosis and prefers to stay positive. “I find comfort in general more easily. (The whole experience) gives me a heightened sense of appreciation. It’s unthinkable for it to be okay not to make the most of your life,” he said. “I think we develop capabilities and problem management, and we learn how to make the best out of a bad situation. You have to be a cheerleader for yourself.” Above all, Bolton is focused on his family and wants to ensure he takes the time to enrich his relationships with his children while he’s able to. “How do I give things that they can take forward? Life lessons, love, any kind of validation that I can give (them) — I want to be on the right side of that so they feel great about who they are,” he said. “It’s a reality of mortality. Suddenly a new light has gone on that raises questions, including ‘Am I doing the best that I can do with my time?’”","Chrissy Callahan, TODAY","April 30, 2025, 5:36 PM GMT+2 / Source: TODAY"
"Terrence Howard refused Marvin Gaye role over prospect of kissing a man, says 'I would cut my lips off'",The former “Empire” star made the confession during a nearly two-hour appearance on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” podcast.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/terrence-howard-marvin-gaye-biopic-rumored-gay-rcna203519,"Actor Terrence Howard revealed that he refused to portray Marvin Gaye in a potential film because of the Motown singer's rumored homosexuality, saying he'd cut his lips off if he ever kissed a man. The former ""Empire"" star made the comment during a nearly two-hour appearance on Bill Maher's ""Club Random"" podcast. Howard told Maher he turned town a chance to play Smokey Robinson because he was in talks with director Lee Daniels for a possible biopic of Gaye. ""You know what happened with that? I was over at Quincy Jones' house ... I'm asking Quincy, 'I'm hearing rumors that Marvin was gay,'"" Howard said. ""And I'm like, 'Was he gay?' And Quincy is like, 'Yes.'"" Daniels, who was an executive producer on ""Empire,"" has not made a film or television series about Gaye's life and it's unclear when Howard had these conversations. Jones, a celebrated music producer, died in November last year. Gaye was married to two women during his life and was not openly queer. Howard went on to say that the filmmakers would have wanted to explore Gaye's rumored homosexuality and that he could not kiss a man. ""I would cut my lips off,"" Howard said. ""If I kissed a man, I would cut my lips off."" Howard attributed it to him not being able to ""fake it"" and he could not act a role he did not understand. Maher told Howard he would not want to a kiss a man either, but ""I would not do that"" in reference to Howard's self-mutilation comment. ""It does not make me homophobic to not want to kiss a man,"" Maher said, comparing it to gay men who would not be interested in women sexually. The comment received some backlash online, with some calling Howard ""deeply problematic"" and others urging people to stop interviewing Howard. One X user questioned how many times Howard was going to tell the world ""he is uncomfortable with his masculinity."" ""He performs masculinity for the approval and acceptance of cishet men and despises gay men,"" the user wrote. ""We know already."" Another brought up Howard's history with domestic abuse following allegations made by two of his former wives. The user wrote, given the allegations, ""I'm having a hard time believing he likes women."" The actor admitted in a 2015 Rolling Stone interview that he hit his ex-wife Lori McCommas in 2001. Michelle Ghent, Howard's second wife, accused him of assaulting her in a lawsuit that she later dropped. Howard told Rolling Stone that Ghent was attempting to pepper-spray him and he was trying to bat her away. Doha Madani is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.

"In retrial openings, prosecutors paint Harvey Weinstein as powerful mogul who 'preyed' on women","Weinstein’s lead attorney forcefully pushed back against the prosecution’s narrative, insisting his client’s sexual encounters were consensual and “mutually beneficial.”",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/retrial-openings-prosecutors-portray-harvey-weinstein-powerful-mogul-p-rcna202561,"Manhattan prosecutors painted a scathing portrait of Harvey Weinstein at the beginning of his sexual abuse retrial Wednesday, presenting the former Hollywood mogul as a serial predator who wielded his power like a weapon against women. Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey described Weinstein as an entertainment industry kingmaker who “held unfettered power for over 30 years” and “preyed” on women — including the three accusers whose allegations led to the criminal charges at the center of the trial. He “wanted their bodies,” Lucey said, referring to the alleged victims Mimi Haley, Kaja Sokola and Jessica Mann. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to two counts of criminal sexual act in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree. He has vehemently denied all allegations of sexual misconduct dating back decades. Lucey, in her opening statement, described Weinstein’s alleged sexual abuse of the three accusers in stark and oftentimes graphic terms. She recounted allegations that Weinstein violently forced himself on them and ignored their pleas to stop. Lucey said Weinstein, “a titan in the industry,” drew in the women by offering to discuss their careers. But the accusers found that he was after something else entirely. “He knew how addictive Hollywood dreams were,” Lucey said. “He knew how the promises of success worked. He strung them along with promises of careers, letters to help, parts in movies ... He simply did not take no for an answer and, if he was told no, he got what he wanted by force.” Haley, a former “Project Runway” production assistant, and Sokola, a former model, allege Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on them in separate incidents in 2006. Mann, a former aspiring actress, alleges Weinstein raped her in 2013. The accusers discovered they were “no match for the man who walked red carpets and rubbed elbows with the famous,” Lucey said. “They stayed quiet for years,” she added, out of “their fear of what he might do to them.” Weinstein’s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, forcefully pushed back against Lucey’s account of events in his opening statement. “What she said to you is not evidence,” Aidalia told jurors at the beginning of his remarks. Aidala implored jurors not to make premature judgements about Weinstein’s character or behavior, drawing on an analogy from his client’s former profession: “You don’t judge a movie by the preview.” “You need to read the whole book and watch the whole movie and put it all in context,” Aidala said, adding that his team believes “there are reasonable doubts” in the prosecution’s case. He went on to argue that Weinstein’s sexual encounters with the accusers were “transactional,” characterizing them as “friends with benefits” arrangements that were “mutually beneficial” and “consensual.” In the case of the three women at the root of the charges, Aidala added, “the casting couch is not a crime scene.” The jury of seven women and five men appeared to listen intently during opening statements. In a statement, Weinstein’s spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, said his client’s team believes “the jury selected is one that can assess the facts with clarity and impartiality.” “We are hopeful that this time, the legal process will rise above noise and narrative and allow Harvey Weinstein the fair trial he’s long been denied. He deserves the chance to clear his name and preserve a legacy that has been overshadowed by deeply flawed and misleading accusations,” Engelmayer said. Weinstein’s retrial arrives a year after New York’s highest court overturned the Oscar-winning producer’s conviction on third-degree rape in a 2020 case. The court found the trial judge had improperly allowed testimony based on allegations that were not part of the case. Haley's and Mann’s allegations were part of the first New York trial. Sokola’s allegations are a new element. Weinstein was indicted in September on charges related to her claims. Weinstein has remained in prison because he was convicted in 2022 of another rape in Los Angeles and sentenced to 16 years. The former producer’s lawyers are appealing that conviction. In recent years, Weinstein has faced various health issues, including a diagnosis of bone marrow cancer. He arrives at court in a wheelchair. Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, once lorded over Hollywood. Miramax, their first distribution label, released seminal films such as “The Crying Game” and “Pulp Fiction.” Harvey Weinstein won an Oscar as a producer of “Shakespeare in Love.” In the early 2010s, the brothers’ second distribution firm scored best picture wins for “The King’s Speech” and “The Artist.” Weinstein’s reign came crashing down in 2017 after The New York Times and The New Yorker published exposés detailing his alleged pattern of sexual harassment and assault. The publication of those articles made Weinstein’s accusers realize they no longer needed to keep in their “shame and pain,” Lucey said, adding: “They suddenly realized they were not alone, they would not be isolated or targeted but would be taken seriously."" In all, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said his sexual encounters were consensual. CORRECTION (April 29, 2025, 12:14 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the last name of Weinstein’s attorney. He is Arthur Aidala, not Aidalia.

Kim Kardashian jewelry heist suspect says he regrets 'trauma' he caused her,"Yunice Abbas, who wrote a book confessing to the crime, was the first defendant questioned Tuesday in the trial in connection with the 2016 robbery during which the reality star was held at gunpoint.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/kim-kardashian-robbery-suspect-says-regrets-trauma-caused-rcna203440,"PARIS — A key defendant in the trial of a group accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in Paris in 2016 and stealing $9 million worth of jewelry, has said he has come to regret the trauma he caused the reality star-turned-business mogul in the years since. Yunice Abbas, perhaps the best-known defendant in the trial, said that despite a yearslong criminal history, this was the first time he had truly come to recognize the “trauma” he had caused his victim. “I regret it, not because I got caught, but because ... there was a trauma,” Abbas, 72, said before a jury Tuesday as proceedings against the 10 people charged in connection with the 2016 robbery resumed after launching Monday afternoon. The first of several defendants set to testify in the trial, Abbas had previously confessed to his role in the heist, detailing the robbery in his 2021 book, “I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.” The matter of the book came up during the testimony, with Abbas saying that he was not responsible for the title and that he disputes his alleged role in the heist. He added that he was not involved in tying up Kardashian, who was staying in Paris for the city's Fashion Week, instead staying downstairs to keep watch. Abbas and nine others, dubbed the “grandpa robbers” in local media because of their ages — some of the accused are in their 70s and 80s — are alleged to have played a range of roles in the heist including holding Kardashian, 44, at gunpoint and being complicit in that crime. During questioning, Abbas described his criminal past — he has spent a total of almost 20 years in jail for various crimes — including the armed robbery of a bank in Belgium. He said that as a young man, he was fiercely opposed to theft but that he had turned to a life of crime because of the bad influence of friends and money difficulties, in the hope it would prove an easier path. Abbas said his family had suffered because of his crimes, adding that he had “never had a role model” himself and he had done what he thought was needed to try to provide for his children. He spoke rapidly during his testimony, his arm shaking throughout, possibly because he has Parkinson's disease. At one point, the shaking was violent enough for him to hold one hand in the other. In the years since the 2016 robbery targeting Kardashian, Abbas said he now felt “very uneasy” with what happened that day. But, he said, “I can’t do anything besides apologize.” Kardashian had been staying at a private apartment complex in the French capital when five of the accused are alleged to have gained entry into the building and robbed her at gunpoint, taking items including her engagement ring from her then-husband Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The five other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs on Kardashian's whereabouts. In the years since, one defendant has died, while the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants due to medical issues. In addition to Abbas, those standing trial will include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as “Old Omar,” who is alleged to have masterminded the robbery; his son, Harminy, 37, accused of being the getaway driver; Didier “Blue Eyes” Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian’s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, who is accused of tipping the others off on Kardashian's whereabouts. Christiane Glotin, 78, is also among the accused, with authorities alleging she was an accomplice in the heist. At least four defendants were expected to be questioned in court Tuesday. Kardashian herself is expected to appear in court May 13. The reality star and businesswoman has previously detailed her experience during the robbery, at one point tearing up in an interview with David Letterman as she described how she feared she would be sexually assaulted and possibly killed during the attack. “I was like, ‘OK, this is the time I’m going to get raped ... just prepare yourself,” she said in the interview, wiping away tears, later describing how she feared her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, would find her dead. “I just kept on thinking about Kourtney,” she said. “She’s going to be traumatized for the rest of her life if she sees me.” Gabrielle Nolin reported from Paris and Chantal Da Silva from London.

'The Last of Us' Star Gabriel Luna unpacks Joel's death and what's next for Tommy,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 3 of “The Last of Us,” which aired April 27.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/the-last-us-star-gabriel-luna-whats-next-for-tommy-rcna203382,"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 3 of “The Last of Us,” which aired April 27. The lives of the “The Last of Us” characters will never be the same following Joel’s death. Pedro Pascal’s character took his last breath in the second episode, the people of Jackson, including Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey), are still reeling from his loss (not to mention the show’s bereft fans). “Whenever you have that type of abrupt shift in your family dynamic, it changes your life,” Gabriel Luna told TODAY.com at a special screening of the show’s third episode hosted by Max and Complex. Luna said that from now on, there is “an absolute, seismic shift in the way the rest of the family interacts with each other.” While Ellie is set on a path of revenge, Tommy, Joel’s brother, is figuring out his next steps, including caring for Ellie. The third episode begins with Tommy looking at Joel’s bloody body, before he starts to wipe his arm clean with a rag. “Give Sarah my love,” Tommy tells his dead brother, referencing Joel’s late daughter, who dies in the show’s premiere. Three months go by and Ellie is adamant about finding Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who killed Joel. She hopes to gather the town’s support. However, Tommy tells Ellie that if they are going to assemble a group to help her in her quest, they have to assemble a council meeting and vote on it. Unfortunately for her, Ellie’s request is voted down. Undeterred, she and Dina (Isabel Merced) forge forward with her plan to go to find Abby in Seattle. Luna shared in a post-screening Q&A that Tommy “absolutely” voted yes to assemble a group to go to Seattle, adding, “I already told her I got her back.” So where does Tommy go from here? Luna said his character feels an even bigger sense of responsibility to protect Ellie. “She’s mine now. She’s my responsibility The weight of of all that, the weight of the burden that she’s taken on, her pursuit of ‘justice’ and revenge is one that she doesn’t go on alone,” Luna said. “I can’t let her.” Luna believes that the question, “Who is the villain?” in the show is one that may be left unanswered so that the audience can address it for themselves. “It’s always a matter of perspective. At some point, I’m the villain in the eyes of whoever may encounter me at any given point,” he said. However, in Tommy’s eyes, he said, “It’s hard to say, because I never met those who brought my brother’s demise upon us.” Luna believes that Tommy doesn’t know Joel killed the Fireflies in an attempt to save Ellie’s life. “And that’s what’s tragic about it, because the fact that Joel kept that with him ‘til his death, and that Ellie is the only one on Earth to live with that is probably why most of these decisions end up being made,” he said. “We make choices and we pay the price. That’s just it. That’s just the whole nature of the whole story,” he said. When it comes down to Joel’s ultimate death, Luna said “to take your main character and end that part of the story” is a “powerful” decision to make. It’s also one that will propel the narrative forward. “That’s life. People die. That’s the truth,” he said. “I love how unyielding our show is about that, and how brutally honest our show is about the way life unfolds for us sometimes, and how abrupt it can be, the shifts, the changes.”","Liz Calvario, TODAY","April 28, 2025, 10:48 PM GMT+2 / Updated April 29, 2025, 1:24 AM GMT+2 / Source: TODAY"
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame unveils 2025 inductees. See who made the list.,"Cyndi Lauper, Outkast, Soundgarden and Chubby Checker are among the seven acts who will be enshrined in the performer category.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/rock-roll-hall-fame-2025-inductees-list-rcna203386,"The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has announced its class of inductees for 2025. Inductees were announced during the April 27 episode of “American Idol,” with Cyndi Lauper, Outkast, Soundgarden and Chubby Checker among the seven acts who will be enshrined in the performer category. Salt-N-Pepa will enter with the musical influence award, which recognized artists who have impacted culture through their music and performance style. The pair joins Outkast to make it the sixth consecutive year at least one rap act will be inducted. 2025 also marks the fourth straight year four or more women will be inducted. While the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame prepares to welcome a new class of talent, several notable nominees, which were announced in February, did not make the final list of inductees. Oasis and Mariah Carey both failed to get inducted for the second straight year. The Black Crowes, Billy Idol and Phish, which notably won the fan vote, also didn’t make the cut. The inductees are determined by an international voting panel made up of more than 1,200 “artists, historians, and music industry professionals,” the Hall of Fame said in a press release announcing the 2025 nominees. “The selection criteria include an artist’s impact on music culture, influence on other musicians that have followed, as well as the scope and longevity of their career and body of work,” the release stated. But some fans on social media couldn’t believe the high-profile performers did not get inducted. “I love you @MariahCarey and you don’t need a Rock n Roll induction to validate what you’ve meant to the music industry over the last 35 years and the numerous lives you’ve impacted!” one fan wrote. “You are ONE OF ONE and don’t ever forget that!” “Blows my mind that Billy Idol is not on this list,” one person commented. “You’re missing the winner of the fan vote. @phish. What’s the point of having people vote if it doesn’t mean anything?” asked another X user.

Rupert Grint welcomes 'secret' baby No. 2 and reveals her bright and sunny name,"“A 10/10 baby (so far),” Grint wrote in his Ron Weasley-esque baby announcement.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/rupert-grint-welcomes-second-baby-rcna203384,"Rupert Grint, who played the mischievous best friend in the “Harry Potter” movies, still has a bit of that Ron Weasley charm about him. The 36-year-old actor revealed the arrival of his second baby with partner Georgia Groome in an Instagram post on April 27. Along with a sweet snap of his daughter wearing a white onesie and a teeny tiny grey cardigan, Grint wrote: “‘Secret Child Slightly Revealed’ Introducing Goldie G. Grint. ⭐️ A 10/10 baby (so far).” Grint also seemed to thank their OB-GYN by writing, “Shoutout to @alex.digesu for always delivering.” Grint and Groome announced the arrival of their first baby — also a girl — in May 2020. Grint’s Instagram photo from November 2020 is a sweet image of him snuggling his daughter, Wednesday G. Grint. When chatting with Dylan Dreyer on TODAY in 2022, Grint admitted that he had shown his daughter (then only 2 years old) “a few of the ‘Harry Potter’ trailers just to see if she can kind of recognize her dad, and she can! She can.” The proud dad said that Wednesday even has “a Pez dispenser with my head on it,” so she was familiar with seeing him as Ron Weasley. Even back in 2018, Grint said in an interview with British newspaper The Guardian that he was hoping to eventually become a father. “I’d like to settle down and have kids soon,” he said at the time. “If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.” In a 2021 interview with Glamour, Grint said that after becoming a father, “I’ve changed as a person for sure. It kind of happened overnight, lifestyle-wise. I stopped smoking straight away.” And though he mentioned the sacrifices he made in his personal life as a result of “Harry Potter” fame, he said he would still support Wednesday if she decided to pursue a film career. “I would want her to do what she wants, but I think I’d be a real stage mum,” he said at the time.

How did the creature from 'The Legend of Ochi' get so cute? Director Isaiah Saxon explains,"First came Baby Yoda. Then came Baby Groot. Now, meet Baby Ochi.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/the-legend-of-ochi-director-isaiah-saxon-inspiration-for-character-rcna203389,"The baby creature from “The Legend of Ochi” has captured the internet’s heart — just as its creators intended. Director Isaiah Saxon tells TODAY.com about how his ideas came to life for the ochi, the name of the wild beasts who live in the forests surrounding a remote village on the fictional island of Carpathia, where the family-friendly movie is set. “The goal with designing the ochi was to create a realistic-feeling undiscovered primate species, so that a kid watching the film could wonder, ‘Have I just not seen the BBC nature special yet on this animal?’ Like, this feels like a real animal,” Saxon says. “The Legend of Ochi,” out April 25, stars Helena Zengel alongside Finn Wolfhard, best known from his role as Mike Wheeler on “Stranger Things.” When Zengel’s character Yuri discovers a baby ochi who has been left behind, she’s determined to do whatever it takes to get the adorable creature back to its pack. The pair go on an adventure through woodlands, waters and even a grocery store, where the baby ochi quickly melts the hearts of the characters and viewers alike. Filmed in the Carpathian mountains of Romania, the film takes fantastical elements from its location — but the magic of the baby ochi is that it is a puppet, Wolfhard tells TODAY.com. ""I didn’t see the ochi actually in action until I was on set, and the puppeteers showed me. Basically, they said, ‘Do you want to meet him?’ And I just looked at the puppet, and it looked up at me and blinked and had head movements,” Wolfhard said. “It was like a truly real creature.” There are complicated mechanics behind bringing the ochi to life, Wolfhard says, but it all comes together to make the ochi appear like a real-life animal. “The ochi had a whole team of people, and all the puppeteers are actors because they are all trying to get a very specific performance out of the ochi,” Wolfhard says. “It was six people piloting one creature, as opposed to just one actor, but they were such amazing performers. That’s why I like working with practical effects — it’s so fun because you have that human connection with it.” Saxon says inspiration for the gremlins came in part from his longtime obsession with Chinese golden snub-nosed monkeys. He also took elements from lemurs, tarsiers and other primates for the look of the ochi, while borrowing from birdsong and the noises dolphins make for the language the animals use in the film. “It wasn’t looking to movie creatures or mythical creatures. It was looking to nature,” he says. “I really wanted to pull from the wide variety of superpowers that you do find in nature, and real patterns in zoology, and put them into one fictional animal.” The cuteness factor for the baby ochi was important from the start, Saxon says. After drafting up several drawings of what the ochi would look like for the film, Saxon says he reached out to John Nolan Studios in London to create animatronics for the creatures. “They made a prototype that was completely furless and had no facial movement, but immediately, the five puppeteers brought it to life, it was just completely convincing that this was a real being,” Saxon recalls. “It was absolutely adorable from the break.” Saxon says designing the baby ochi as a puppet adds characteristics that play into how lovable the creature becomes throughout the film. “A lot of the little imperfections that you might see in a baby primate trying to move learn how to move their own body, those are the types of little things that come through in rod puppeteering,” he says. “So it had that vulnerability from the beginning, from the puppetry.” Once the crew was on set filming in Romania, “there was a tremendous amount of effort in just like, policing his cuteness,” Saxon says of the baby ochi. He joked about a “last-minute rhinoplasty” to make the baby’s nose cuter after realizing it wasn’t quite right, and other situations on set to ensure the creature had the look he was going for. The film, which launched in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles on April 17, is headed to theaters nationwide on April 25. But the hype for the charm of the baby ochi is only just beginning, as viewers start to react to the gremlin on social media. “I just watched THE LEGEND OF OCHI and I want everyone to know that I would die for this little guy,” one user posted on X. “I completely adored THE LEGEND OF OCHI. It pulls inspiration from Amblin movies like E.T., Jim Henson’s classics, and even Ghibli, but still takes tons of *weird* swings that create its own identity full of wonder,” another X user wrote. “They literally don’t make family adventures like this anymore.” “Just like ‘E.T.’ was for so many of my generation I hope there’s a kid out there whose new favorite movie is THE LEGEND OF OCHI and it inspires them to become a filmmaker,” another X user posted. “Lovely movie.” Another X user said: “The Legend of Ochi is a wholesome fantasy adventure. It has really beautiful puppetry and practical effects that really make the Ochi come to life. You love every second baby Ochi is on screen. The world feels very beautiful and unique.” Others, understandably, were just reacting to finding out how adorable the baby ochi is. “How have I not heard about this darling baby Ochi until today?” a user wrote on X, adding a teary-eyed emoji and two heart-eye emoji. “In love with this little guy,” another X user said with a heart-eyed emoji. “can’t wait to see the movie!” “Omg he’s perfect,” another replied on X to a photo of the baby ochi puppet wearing a baseball cap. A24, the film’s distributor, also joined in on the fun, posting a photo of the baby ochi with its arms raised with the caption, “When you find out The Legend of Ochi isn’t nationwide until next Friday but you need that little guy right now.” “The Legend of Ochi” debuted in theatres on April 25.","Anna Kaplan, TODAY","April 28, 2025, 10:11 PM GMT+2 / Source: TODAY"
