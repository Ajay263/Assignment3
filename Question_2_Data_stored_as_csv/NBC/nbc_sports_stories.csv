"Until NFL investigation ends, Justin Tucker could have a difficult time finding a new team",The Ravens have released kicker Justin Tucker. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/until-nfl-investigation-ends-justin-tucker-could-have-a-difficult-time-finding-a-new-team?cid=nbcnews,"The Ravens have released kicker Justin Tucker. Once the transaction becomes official (presumably today), Tucker will become a free agent. In theory, he’ll be able to sign immediately with any team. As a practical matter, any interested team will likely wait. The NFL’s investigation regarding the allegations made against Tucker (he denies them all) will continue. He could eventually be suspended. It’s sensible to assume that teams will wait for the decision to be made — and the suspension, if any, to be served — before offering him a roster spot. Beyond the potential P.R. impact of bringing a kicker who doesn’t kick as well as he once did to town, Tucker’s next team won’t know when it will be able to use him until the suspension, if any, is served. If that’s how it plays out, it becomes important for Tucker to get this behind him as soon as he can. If it lingers into the 2025 season, he’ll be essentially suspended. That could make a negotiated outcome more attractive to him, with Tucker’s representatives and the league reaching an agreement on a number of games. The 2020 CBA changed the landscape regarding Personal Conduct Policy cases. Now, a third party conducts a hearing and makes findings of fact that cannot be appealed. There’s risk for both sides. Judge Sue L. Robinson (who handled the Deshaun Watson case in 2022) could find that the evidence shows wrongdoing by Tucker. She also could find that the evidence falls short of proving that he did anything. Still, if it lingers, Tucker loses. He needs to get this resolved by Week 1, if his goal is to end up with a new team as soon as possible. It’s still possible for a new team to decide to give him a shot, knowing that if/when he’s suspended, another kicker will be needed. Still, few teams will want to embrace the scrutiny that would go along with welcoming Tucker to town under the cloud of unresolved allegations involving misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. Especially since the supply of competent kickers always outweighs the demand — and since Tucker wasn’t in 2024 the kicker he used to be.

"Ted Cruz: NFL has been ""tiptoeing up to the rule"" protecting college and high school football","Hearing on broadcast vs. streaming could spark new legislation, eventually. NBC SPORTS",N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/ted-cruz-nfl-has-been-tiptoeing-up-to-the-rule-protecting-college-and-high-school-football?cid=nbcnews,"The Senate Commerce Committee has proceeded with a hearing on the pivot from sports broadcasting to streaming, without any involvement by the NFL. (Commissioner Roger Goodell declined an invitation to appear.) In his opening comments, Committee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) made a pointed comment about the NFL. He said the league has been “tiptoeing up to” the line that protects college and high school football from being diluted by pro football. The line appears in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1960, which gave the NFL a broadcast antitrust exemption with one key concession — the NFL cannot broadcast games from the second weekend in September through the second weekend in December on Friday night or Saturday. “One growing concern is that the NFL has used its special exemption in the SBA to the frustration of college and high school football schedulers,” Cruz said, via a transcript provided by the Committee. “For example, the SBA explicitly excludes antitrust protection for the NFL if broadcasting a game on a Friday night or a Saturday between mid-September to mid-December. That’s to protect the interests of high school and college football, and ultimately, their fans who are no doubt also followers of the NFL. “The NFL has tiptoed up to this rule, now putting a game on streaming on Black Friday afternoon, which used to be a slot reserved for prominent college football rivalries, including in some years, Texas and Texas A&M. There are millions of sports fans who like being able to follow high school, college, and professional football without having to choose amongst them. And it’s partly why Congress wrote the SBA in the manner it did.” Cruz mentioned only the Black Friday game, which starts at 3:00 p.m. ET and ideally ends before the 6:00 p.m. ET witching hour, in support of his observation. The league also has started streaming games on the first Friday of September, when the first Friday coincides with the first week of the NFL season — and clearly conflicts with high school football. There has been speculation that, with the Republican party controlling the White House and Congress, the NFL may press for revisions to the SBA that would eliminate the Friday night and/or Saturday exception. Given that a prominent Republican senator seems to be firmly in favor of enforcing the limits of the current law, Cruz likely would be against allowing the NFL to broadcast games within the current window that is regarded as off-limits. The broader question is whether streaming fits within the SBA at all. That could be a question for the courts. Or it could become a subject for further legislation. Today’s hearing seems to be a step toward considering something that would counter the exodus of live pro sports from free TV to pay TV. We’ll continue to monitor the hearing for anything related to the NFL. You can watch it here, assuming you have consumed the appropriate amount of coffee and/or Red Bull.

Billy Horschel's Ryder Cup dreams likely dashed with this announcement,Horschel revealed Tuesday that he will be sidelined until at least late summer because of right hip surgery that will take place next week in Colorado. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/golf/news/billy-horschels-ryder-cup-dreams-likely-dashed-with-this-announcement?cid=nbcnews,"Billy Horschel’s Ryder Cup dreams are likely dashed – for this year at least. Horschel announced Tuesday morning that he is set to undergo right hip surgery early next week in Colorado and will be sidelined multiple months, perhaps the rest of this season. “It’s an unfortunate situation with so many great events left on the calendar, but this is a preventative measure,” Horschel said. “I’m already itching to start rehab, get back to practicing, and I look forward to returning to the course sometime around late summer/early fall.” Horschel withdrew from the Zurich Classic, where he was set to partner with Tom Hoge, citing a lower body injury. The 38-year-old Horschel had made 12 starts this season, posting two top-10s but also missing five cuts. He currently sits No. 58 in FedExCup points, No. 24 in the Official World Golf Ranking and No. 16 in U.S. Ryder Cup points. Horschel also competed in the inaugural season of TGL, where his Atlanta Drive GC won the title. Horschel’s performance, passion and energy while playing on that team prompted many to tab him for a potential Ryder Cup debut this fall at Bethpage. The matches are scheduled for Sept. 25-28, so even if Horschel returns before then, he would need to receive a captain’s pick from Keegan Bradley, and even then, he likely would not have many, if any, reps. “Every time we’re in a Ryder Cup year, I’m very well aware that I haven’t been part of a Ryder Cup team,” Horschel told Golf Channel on April 1. “But I can’t solely focus on that. I can’t have that be the driving force. At the end of the day, I’ve got to try and continue to get better as a player, continue to improve as a person, and hopefully through those gains and improvement, I can finally make a Ryder Cup team. I’ve done a lot of things in my career that I’m very grateful for and the wins I’ve had, and do I feel like I should be on a Ryder Cup team? Yeah, but have I done what I need to in terms of playing three, four, five months of consistent golf leading into the Ryder Cup? I haven’t done that, and that’s sort of been the Achilles heel a little bit; I just haven’t played as well over a period of time as the other 12 guys. “I’m in the best situation that I think I’ve ever been in my career, at this stage, six months out from a Ryder Cup. I think if I can continue to improve and continue to play well and play consistently well, hopefully it lends itself to being a part of a Ryder Cup team. “I would love to be a part of that zoo in New York. … It’s going to be the craziest Ryder Cup ever.” DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Nylander has 2 goals and an assist as Maple Leafs beat Panthers 5-4 in Game 1 of 2nd round series,"Matthew Knies and Chris Tanev each had a goal and an assist, and Morgan Rielly also scored for the Maple Leafs. NBC SPORTS",N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nhl/news/nylander-has-2-goals-and-an-assist-as-maple-leafs-beat-panthers-5-4-in-game-1-of-2nd-round-series?cid=nbcnews,"John E. Sokolowski-Imagn Images TORONTO (AP) William Nylander got the Toronto Maple Leafs off to a fast start in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Nylander scored twice in the first period before adding an assist as Toronto built a big lead before holding on to beat the Florida Panthers 5-4 on Monday night in the series opener. Matthew Knies and Chris Tanev each had a goal and an assist, and Morgan Rielly also scored for the Maple Leafs. Max Pacioretty and Jake McCabe each had two assists. “We’ve been in tight games throughout the season,” Nylander said. “We dug into that and tried to bear down.” Anthony Stolars stopped eight of the nine shots he faced before leaving in the second period after he took an elbow to the head from Panthers forward Sam Bennett, who wasn’t penalized on the play. The Maple Leafs said the 31-year-old was being evaluated, but provided no further update. “Elbow to the head,” Toronto coach Craig Berube said. “Clear as day. ... I get it, they miss calls. But it’s clearly a penalty.” Joseph Woll stopped 17 shots in relief. Seth Jones, Eetu Luostarinen, Uvis Balinskis and Sam Bennett scored for the Panthers, and Brad Marchand and Carter Verhaeghe each had two assists. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 24 shots. Florida beat Toronto in five games in the second round in the 2023 playoffs on the way to reaching the Stanley Cup Final. The Panthers went one step further last year when they won the Cup for the first time in franchise history. Game 2 is Wednesday back at Scotiabank Arena, before shifting to South Florida for two games. Toronto opened the scoring just 33 seconds after puck drop when Nylander beat Bobrovsky through the five-hole from a tight angle for his fourth goal of the playoffs. The Maple Leafs, who beat Ottawa in six games in the first round to register just the second series win for the Original Six franchise in more than two decades, went up 2-0 with 7:09 left in the first when Nylander scooped up a rebound before deking Bobrovsky to the ice and roofing his second of the period. “He came out and was feeling it,” Rielly said of the slick winger. “That helps set the tone.” Jones got the Panthers on the board with a shot from the point through traffic on a power play with 3:03 remaining for his second of the postseason. Toronto restored its two-goal lead just 19 seconds later when Nylander sent Rielly off to the races on a 2-on-1 with John Tavares. The defenseman and longest serving member of the current roster looked Bobrovsky off before firing past the goalie’s blocker for his third of the postseason. “Obviously it wasn’t a great start by us,” Panthers forward Aleksander Barkov said. “We knew they were going to come hard and strong.” Florida, which beat the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games to advance, got a man advantage in the second that saw Stolarz make a couple of stops, but Bennett caught him with a sneaky elbow to the back of the head. Toronto made it 4-1 at 7:50 when Tanev’s knuckling shot from distance fooled Bobrovsky for his first. Stolarz, who backed up Bobrovsky on the way to Florida’s Cup win a year ago, was seen on television vomiting by the bench a few minutes later before getting replaced by Woll. Nylander had a chance to complete the first playoff hat trick of his career on a shot that knocked the stick out of Bobrovsky’s hand but the puck stayed out as the Maple Leafs headed to the locker room up three. Luostarinen cut the deficit back to two on a redirection 1:41 into the third, and Balinskis then made it 4-3 at 4:30 after a Panthers push inside a suddenly tense building. “We didn’t look like ourselves,” Florida head coach Paul Maurice said of his team’s opening period. “And then (we) righted it in the second and after that had a pretty good push in the third.” Toronto failed to connect on two power plays later in third before Bobrovsky denied Max Domi on a break. Knies made it 5-3 with 6 minutes left in regulation with a move to the backhand on another breakaway. Bennett got his team back within one with 1:55 left in regulation on a pinballed shot off a Toronto stick, but Woll and the Maple Leafs held the fort late to secure an early lead in the series. “That was nice for us,” Nylander said. “But we’re just focused on next game now.” The Panthers were without defenseman Aaron Ekblad, who finished off a two-game suspension for his headshot on Tampa Bay forward Brandon Hagel in the opening round. The Maple Leafs have three players from the Panthers’ championship team - Stolarz, defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Steven Lorentz.

NASCAR Championship Weekend moving to Homestead in 2026,NASCAR will begin rotating sites for the championship race in 2026. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nascar/news/nascar-championship-weekend-moving-to-homestead-in-2026?cid=nbcnews,"NASCAR’s Championship Weekend will return to Homestead-Miami Speedway in 2026, the sanctioning body announced Tuesday morning. NASCAR also announced that it will rotate its season finale for the Cup, Xfinity and Craftsman Truck Series starting next year among “NASCAR’s marquee venues and key markets.” NBC Sports, which has broadcast the Cup playoffs and championship race since 2015, will do so through 2031. Phoenix, which has hosted NASCAR’s Championship Weekend since 2020, will be among the rotating sites for the season-ending race for each series. NASCAR also announced that Phoenix will host two Cup weekends next year and that the track’s second race weekend will be in the third round of the playoffs. Those dates will be announced later. Homestead-Miami Speedway’s Championship Weekend will be Nov. 6-8 in 2026. Homestead hosted the championship races for Cup, Xfinity and Trucks from 2002-19 before the season finale moved to Phoenix. “Homestead-Miami Speedway has a history of competitive, championship racing that will provide nostalgia for veteran drivers and fans and exhilaration for NASCAR’s new generation,” said Ben Kennedy, EVP, Chief Venue & Racing Innovation Officer, in a statement. “As we move forward, the rotating model will provide new challenges for competitors as well as opportunities for unique venues to host our loyal fans at NASCAR Championship Weekend.” Kyle Larson won the most recent Cup race at Homestead, taking the checkered flag in March in a race that had 27 lead changes. Last fall’s playoff race at Homestead saw Tyler Reddick win after going from third to first on the last lap. The last three laps each had a different leader in that event. “This place is awesome,” said Christopher Bell, who finished fourth in that race and watched those lead changes ahead of him. “It leads to some amazing races.” He’s not the only driver who feels that way. “It’s just an awesome race track,” Larson said of Homestead this season. “Definitely the best across all the series in our sport. It’s just fun. It races kind of similar in all the divisions. It’s just a cool place.” DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

A key ruling in Jon Gruden's pending lawsuit could come at any time,"In Monday's item about former Raiders, Buccaneers, and Raiders coach Jon Gruden joining the AF1's Nashville Kats as a part owner and adviser, we mentioned his pending lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. NBC SPORTS",N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/a-key-ruling-in-jon-grudens-pending-lawsuit-could-come-at-any-time?cid=nbcnews,"In Monday’s item about former Raiders, Buccaneers, and Raiders coach Jon Gruden joining the AF1’s Nashville Kats as a part owner and adviser, we mentioned his pending lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. There’s been no news about the case in months, so we checked on its status. The litigation is still pending before the Nevada Supreme Court on a rehearing before the full court as to the question of whether the case will proceed in court, or whether it will be sent to the NFL’s in-house arbitration system, also known in some places (here) as a secret, rigged, kangaroo court. A ruling. we’re told, could come at any time. The last order was issued on October 10, 2024, with the Nevada Supreme Court granting the request for “en banc” reconsideration — and explaining that the decision would be made based on the existing briefs and official record. Gruden won at the trial court level on the question of whether the case should remain in the Nevada court system. The NFL prevailed before a three-judge panel of the Nevada Supreme Court. At least two judges of the full court agreed to conduct a rehearing before all seven judges. Gruden lost, 2-1, before the three judges who considered the case the first time around. Now, with seven judges on the full court, Gruden will need at least four to agree with his position that the NFL should not be permitted to seize on a very aggressive interpretation of the league’s Constitution and Bylaws to pull the dispute into arbitration. Beyond the question of whether the NFL Constitution and Bylaws justify mandatory arbitration of Gruden’s case is the broader issue regarding whether the Commissioner should have ultimate authority over legal claims made against the NFL generally and/or the Commissioner specifically. However it plays out, the issue seems to be destined for the U.S. Supreme Court. Which currently has more than enough pro-business judges to deliver a win for the NFL. Even if Gruden shares the same general political views that could eventually torpedo his case.

"Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Golden State Warriors Preview: 2025 NBA Playoffs series prediction, schedule",This is only the third ever meeting of the No. 6 and No. 7 seeds in the playoffs. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/minnesota-timberwolves-vs-golden-state-warriors-preview-2025-nba-playoffs-series-prediction-schedule?cid=nbcnews,"This is only the third time in NBA history that the No. 6 and No. 7 seeds meet in the playoffs. However, the last time was two years ago and also included the Warriors (vs. Lakers, a series won by Los Angeles, who was then swept in the conference finals by eventual champion Denver). Here is what to know from this series. Minnesota travels to Golden State for the series opener on Tuesday night, May 6, at 9:30 p.m. Eastern. This is a fast turnaround for the Warriors, who played in a Game 7 in Houston on Sunday. All times are Eastern (* = if necessary) Game 1: Warriors at Timberwolves (Tue. May 6, 9:30 ET, TNT) Game 2: Warriors at Timberwolves (Thu. May 8, 8:30 ET, TNT) Game 3: Timberwolves at Warriors (Sat. May 10, 8:30 ET, ABC) Game 4: Timberwolves at Warriors (Mon. May 12, 10 ET, ESPN) Game 5: Warriors at Timberwolves (Wed. May 14, TBD, TNT)* Game 6: Timberwolves at Warriors (Sun. May 18, TBD, TBD)* Game 7: Warriors at Timberwolves (Tue. May 20, 8:30 ET, ESPN)* Nobody guarded Stephen Curry more in the regular season than Jaden McDaniels. Per NBA.com, McDaniels spent 28:40 matched up with Curry across four regular season matchups. The next closest was Keegan Murray at 18:50. Curry averaged 28.8 points per game against Minnesota in the regular season, and the Warriors went 3-1 in their matchups. The last time these teams played was in January, and Golden State’s lineup looks quite different. That shouldn’t change things for McDaniels, who averaged four fouls per game in the first round. They need him on the floor and making life difficult for Curry. McDaniels enjoyed the best statistical season of his career this year, and that translated into 17.4 points per game in the first round. The Warriors’ defense will be keyed in on slowing down Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle, and McDaniels will need to step up as a scorer. He only averaged 10.8 points per game against the Warriors in the regular season. This series is a big opportunity for him on both ends of the floor. —Noah Rubin, Rotoworld basketball analyst Golden State’s most-used lineup — and arguably best — in the first round was a small-ball five with Stephen Curry, Brandin Podziemski, Buddy Hield, Jimmy Butler III and Draymond Green at center (it had a +13.9 net rating). That lineup will struggle to defend a huge Minnesota starting five of Mike Conley, Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert. It’s an issue of size. Steve Kerr can start Butler on Ant and Green on Randle to try and slow the two Minnesota shot creators (or swap the Butler/Green assignments), but there are potential mismatches elsewhere, such as who guards Gobert? The French big man punished the Lakers in the last series when they went small (particularly in the closeout game). Kerr could play a lot of Kevon Looney to match up with Gobert, but that still leaves a smaller player on McDaniels while at the same time hurting the Warriors’ offense. Gary Payton II could get heavy minutes this season because of his defense. Golden State’s ultimate concern is this: A big Minnesota team plays nearly as good of defense as Houston, but led by Edwards, the Timberwolves’ offense is exponentially better. Especially if Randle plays at the level he did against the Lakers. There’s more than a little history here. In a playoffs where the referees have permitted — if not outright green lit — increased physicality, letting Green and Gobert go at it with the proverbial gloves off could impact the series. Another thing to watch with Green and Gobert: Will one have a big offensive impact in a game or games? When they did (Gobert in Game 5 vs. the Lakers, Green early in Game 7 vs. the Rockets), it’s a huge boost for their team. —Kurt Helin, NBC Sports lead NBA writer Minnesota is a version of Houston that can actually score. The Wolves will give GSW a lot of the same issues the Rockets did - size, athleticism, speed - but instead of Jalen Green as chief protagonist on offense it’ll be Anthony Edwards. This Minnesota team looks improved on last year’s version that entered the conference finals as heavy favorite - they’re more versatile now and can play more styles. Their ability to play super big, or go 5 out with elite spacing and switching, should be too much for Golden State. Golden State has the best offensive player in the series with Steph and the experience with vet players and coach, but the numbers look bad in terms of overall matchup here, and the Warriors are coming out of a truly physical seven-game series that may have taken the wind out of their sails. Minnesota has had a propensity for playing with their food so I’m prepared to be wrong and would love a better price for them in series than what is currently available but it’s looking like a clean win for Minnesota to me. Before the playoffs tipped off, I predicted Golden State would advance to the Western Conference Finals, but after seeing Minnesota in person in the first round and watching the Warriors vs. Rockets games, I changed my mind. Anthony Edwards is ready for his star turn and will be the best player in this series (sorry, Steph), the Timberwolves’ defense will challenge the Warriors as much or more than Houston, and Minnesota brings size across the board that Golden State will struggle to handle. The Warriors with Butler will not go quietly, but this is a rough matchup for them, if they thought the Rockets were physical… DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

Knicks vs. Celtics Game 1: New York steals (Mikal Bridges literally) Game 1 from Boston in overtime thriller,Celtics set a playoff record with 45 missed 3-pointers in a game where they launched 60. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/new-york-steals-mikal-bridges-literally-game-1-from-boston-in-overtime-thriller?cid=nbcnews,"Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, were you happy with your team’s shot selection in Game 1? “For the most part,” he answered. That explains a lot of this game. Boston followed Mazzulla’s blueprint and launched 60 3-pointers in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference Semi-Final matchup with New York, missing 45 (an NBA playoff record) and hitting just 15, or 25%. Boston shooters missed a lot of open ones, but they also took a lot of difficult, contested ones, as well as tough shots in the paint. “Some of them felt good, some of them felt like we maybe forced the issue,” Jaylen Brown said. “Definitely our rhythm and our timing was a little bit off. We got a lot of great looks, but there may be some truth to that. We’ve got to look at the film and see what happened in that second half.” The Celtics had success early with matchup hunting — Jayson Tatum going after Karl-Anthony Towns, getting the big man in foul trouble — and led by as many as 20 in the third quarter. Then Boston’s shooting dried up. The Knicks were the definition of resilient — they could have rolled over down 20 but didn’t. With a 20-6 run in the second half of the third quarter, New York stormed back to make it a game. Jalen Brunson was doing his own matchup hunting, going at Al Horford, and it worked. The game went to overtime, and Mikal Bridges’ defense sealed it more than anything. The result was a 108-105 New York win that has the Knicks up 1-0 on the road and left Celtics faithful stunned and confused. Boston, as it had at points during the regular season, stuck with what wasn’t working and didn’t shift enough to getting buckets in the paint, or even good looks from the midrange (the Celtics were 6-of-15 on shots from four feet out to the arc). The result was opening the door for New York, but Boston saw this more as just missed shots. “Probably some times where we settled,” said Jayson Tatum, who finished with 29 points but was 0-of-7 shooting in the fourth quarter. “I could’ve put more pressure on the rim. But a lot of times, we felt like we got really, really good looks and just couldn’t convert.” Meanwhile, Jalen Brunson just kept making plays on his way to 29 points, and OG Anunoby matched him bucket for bucket. While the Celtics were missing, the Knicks hit 17 3-pointers, shooting 45.9% from beyond the arc. In last year’s playoffs, an injury or just an off night for Boston didn’t automatically mean a loss, as it cruised to the title. That is not going to be the case this season. If the Celtics want to repeat, they must play closer to their peak. They did not on Monday night and now find themselves in a hole against a resiliant Knicks team that is playing with great confidence and believes it can win this series.

Witnessing the Islanders win the NHL draft lottery on Monday and vault nine other teams in the order for the right to have the No. 1 pick represented yet another memorable moment for the four-time Stanley Cup champion and member of the 1980 gold-medal-winning “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic team. “I’ve had a lot of thrills in my hockey life, but this is right up there at the top,” Morrow said. “The hockey gods smiled on us. I can’t tell you how thrilled I am for Islanders fans, for our ownership, for the entire Islanders organization.” The Islanders, who missed the playoffs for the second time in four seasons, are in the midst of a front-office shakeup after not renewing general manager Lou Lamoriello’s contract on April 22. And they earned a remarkable lottery win by entering the day with a 3.5% shot — the 10th-best odds — of seeing their numbers come up. New York wasn’t the only team to buck the lottery odds. The Utah Hockey Club won the second round of the lottery, and made the jump from 14th to fourth under the rules limiting teams from moving up no more than 10 spots in the draft order. “A couple of seconds ago, we were just like 10 back, so it still hasn’t sunk in,” Utah GM Bill Armstrong said of a first-year franchise that finished just seven points out of a playoff spot. “This is an exciting moment for us. It’s a game-changer for us.” The San Jose Sharks will pick second after entering the day with the best odds, 18.5%, to win the lottery and a 25.5% chance of landing the No. 1 choice. San Jose, which finished last for a second consecutive year, was seeking to become the NHL’s first team to win the lottery and pick first in consecutive years. “We definitely lucked it out last year to be able to select Mac,” Sharks GM Mike Grier said in referring to selecting Boston University center Macklin Celebrini first overall. “This year would have obviously been nice to have the pick and have the choice of all the players. But picking two, we’re still in a pretty good spot so we’re happy.” The Chicago Blackhawks had the second-best chances to win the lottery and will pick third. The remaining 12 teams moved two spots back in the order, starting with Nashville dropping from third to fifth. The final 16 draft spots will be determined following the playoffs. The Islanders have the right to pick first for the fifth time in team history, and first since selecting John Tavares with the No. 1 choice in 2009. This year’s draft will be held in Los Angeles with the first round taking place on June 27, followed by the final six rounds the next day. Top prospects will convene for the weeklong predraft combine being held in Buffalo next month. The prospect pool is not considered as deep at the top as last year’s class, or next year’s group, with Canadian junior forward Gavin McKenna long regarded as the No. 1 candidate. Erie Otters defenseman Matthew Schaefer is NHL Central Scouting’s top-ranked North American prospect followed by OHL Saginaw center Michael Misa and Boston College center James Hagens, the top-ranked U.S. born prospect. Hagens is from Long Island and grew up an Islanders fan. Listed at 6-foot-2 and 183 pounds, Schaefer maintained his No. 1 position despite missing the final three months of the season after breaking his right collarbone representing Canada at the world junior championships in December. Schaefer has the potential of becoming only the fifth defenseman selected No. 1 since 2000, and first since Buffalo chose Owen Power in 2021. And he also has the chance of being the first OHL player to go No. 1 since Edmonton drafted Erie’s Connor McDavid in 2015. The top-ranked international skaters are center Anton Frondell and right wing Victor Eklund, who are teammates with Djurgarden of Sweden’s second division league. New York’s jump from 10th to first is the biggest involving a team winning the No. 1 selection. And it comes after the last-place team won the lottery to retain the first pick in four of the past five years and 12 times overall since the NHL launched the format in 1995. The New York Rangers enjoyed the previous largest move up to No. 1 in 2020, when they were grouped among eight teams — ranked eighth to 15th — with the same odds to win the lottery after being eliminated in the COVID-altered play-in round of the expanded 24-team playoff format. The lottery was held at the NHL Network studios in New Jersey, and conducted live for the first time in the event’s 30-year history. Previously, the lottery was held shortly before the broadcast in front of a limited audience of sequestered observers, followed by the draft selections being revealed in reverse order.

Nuggets vs. Thunder Game 1: Aaron Gordon 3-pointer caps Denver comeback to steal Game 1 in Oklahoma City,Nikola Jokic was the best player on the floor with 42 points and 22 rebounds. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nba/news/aaron-gordon-3-pointer-caps-19-6-denver-run-to-come-from-behind-steal-game-1-in-oklahoma-city-121-119?cid=nbcnews,"In a span of less than five minutes Monday night, the “Oklahoma City isn’t ready for this” crowd got all the ammunition it needed. The Thunder led most of the night by double-digits, by 13 at one point in the fourth quarter and by 11 with 4:31 left after a Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 3-pointer. All OKC needed was its league-best defense to do its job and it would have another home playoff win. Then Denver went on a 19-6 run to close the game, capped off by another Aaron Gordon clutch moment, this one a game-winning 3-pointer. That combined with a 42-point, 22-rebound night from Nikola Jokic earned a resilient Denver Nuggets team a 121-119 road win and a 1-0 lead in this Western Conference Semi-Final series. Game 2 is Wednesday night in Oklahoma City. This is a heartbreaking loss for the Thunder, who were up by double-digits most of the night but could not close it out. “We’re gonna find out what we’re made of,” Gilgeous-Alexander said after the loss. He finished the night with 33 points on 12-of-26 shooting. If Oklahoma City wants to know why it lost, or if Denver wants to know why it won, there are two key things (in addition to Jokic being the best player on the court): 1) Offensive rebounds. Denver had 21 of them, leading to 27 second-chance points. Gordon had seven of those rebounds. 2) Missed free throws. Oklahoma City was 20-of-28 from the line, and no two misses were as critical as Chet Holmgren’s two with 9.5 seconds left in the game and the Thunder up one. Holmgren’s teammates rightly pointed out this game was not lost in the last 15 seconds; this was a night of mistakes by the Thunder that left the door open just enough for Aaron Gordon to come barging through and get the win. Gordon finished with 22 points and 14 rebounds for Denver, while Jamal Murray added 21 points and six assists. For the Thunder, after SGA’s 33, there was 20 off the bench from Alex Caruso, who also had five steals and played a fantastic game. Jalen Williams has to be better, 16 points on 5-of-20 shooting is not good enough.

"Michael Strahan, Eli Manning prepare competing bids for Giants' minority stake",Two former teammates will soon be competing for a piece of their team. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/michael-strahan-eli-manning-prepare-competing-bids-for-giants-minority-stake?cid=nbcnews,"Two former teammates will now be competing to buy a piece of the team for which they played. Sportico reports that Hall of Fame defensive end Michael Strahan plans to make a bid for the 10-percent stake that the Giants are looking to sell. Strahan will partner with billionaire Marc Lasry in the effort to come up with the $750 million (or more) needed to buy one tenth of the team. Former Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who inevitably will join Strahan in Canton, has a separate bid in the works. He reportedly had “preliminary conversations” about joining Strahan’s group, but Eli ultimately decided to go it alone. The Strahan-Lasry combo is the latest example of the newest dynamic when it comes to minority NFL ownership, sparked by the ever-skyrocket value of teams. A rich guy with significant name recognition in league circles combines with a really rich guy with no existing pro football footprint to come up with the cash necessary to do the deal. Presumably, the Giants are looking for market value for the interest they’re selling. Raiders owner Mark Davis opted to give Tom Brady a steep discount for the value of his involvement in football operations. Most owners won’t leave that many millions on the table, when they can hire proven football executives for far, far less than that. Especially not for a player who never played for the team. In New York, where both Strahan and Manning have their numbers retired (unless and until the Giants draft a player who asks to wear it), the Giants likely won’t be retiring the age-old habit of seeking the best deal possible for what they are selling.

"Jalen Milroe working to become a more ""efficient passer"" ahead of rookie season","Jalen Milroe was a successful quarterback at Alabama, but his ability to make plays with his feet led to discussion heading into the draft about whether he'd be used in other ways as an NFL player. NBC SPORTS",N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/jalen-milroe-working-to-become-a-more-efficient-passer-ahead-of-rookie-season?cid=nbcnews,"Jalen Milroe was a successful quarterback at Alabama, but his ability to make plays with his feet led to discussion heading into the draft about whether he’d be used in other ways as an NFL player. Milroe was adamant that he’s only a quarterback and Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said the same thing after Seattle took Milroe in the third round last month. That may settle one question, but it doesn’t guarantee that Milroe is going to get a chance to show that he can handle the starting job. The rookie has been working with quarterback coach Jordan Palmer to help his bid and Milroe explained some of what he’s been doing during the team’s rookie minicamp. “The biggest thing is everything works from the ground up at the quarterback position,” Milroe said, via Seattle Sports. “It’s understanding the lower-half mechanics of how I operate. Every quarterback is different, and so . . . it’s understanding how to distribute my body when it comes to the lower-half mechanics. That’s been a focus for us. It’s all about being an efficient passer. And so the more you work, the more you understand your body, you’re going to be more of an efficient passer. So that’s something that we continue to work on.” With Sam Darnold and Drew Lock on the roster in Seattle, practice reps are going to be limited for Milroe so his extracurricular work will be all the more significant as he tries to work his way onto the field.

"Barry Sanders thinks Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery can lead the Lions to a Super Bowl",Saquon Barkley's big season with the Eagles has led to renewed talk that NFL teams can ride a running back to the Super Bowl. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/barry-sanders-thinks-jahmyr-gibbs-david-montgomery-can-lead-the-lions-to-a-super-bowl?cid=nbcnews,"Saquon Barkley’s big season with the Eagles has led to renewed talk that NFL teams can ride a running back to the Super Bowl. Or in the case of the Lions, perhaps ride two running backs to the Super Bowl. Barry Sanders, who won only one playoff game during his Hall of Fame career with the Lions, told USA Today that he thinks the combination of Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery can give the Lions a championship offense, revolving around its running game. “They’re the best duo in the NFL and there’s no reason that’s going to change any time soon,” Sanders said. “If a Super Bowl is in our future, in our near future, you would think those two guys would be a big part of it.” Sanders said he’s been a fan of Montgomery’s since before the Lions signed him, and that Gibbs showed when Montgomery missed time with a knee injury last season that he’s also more than capable of being a No. 1 running back. “David Montgomery, he’s been a great running back in the NFL for many years, and he just added to that coming over from the Bears and putting him with this Lions offensive line,” Sanders said. “And then, you see what Jahmyr Gibbs was able to do last season, really from the time, the last two years that he’s been here, but I felt like last year was more of a breakout season for him.” It was the Lions’ best regular season in almost 70 years, but it fizzled in the playoffs. If the Lions are ever going to get over the hump in the postseason, Sanders thinks it will be on the back of their running game.

A second person has been charged with murder of reporter during Super Bowl week,Another suspect has been charged with killing a Kansas City-based reporter during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/a-second-person-has-been-charged-with-murder-of-reporter-during-super-bowl-week?cid=nbcnews,"Another suspect has been charged with killing a Kansas City-based reporter during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. Via the Associated Press, Louisiana authorities announced on Monday that Rickey White, 34, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the death of 27-year-old Adan Manzano, a reporter and anchor for Telemundo. White is the alleged accomplice of 48-year-old Danette Colbert, who was charged in March. That same month, White was arrested in Florida on robbery and fraud charges related to Manzano’s murder. White was then extradited to Louisiana. Attorney Kevin Boshea, who represents White, told the AP that he has not been informed of the murder charge. “I don’t think he’s guilty of the other crimes, so how can he be guilty of murder?” Boshea said. An autopsy revealed that Manzano died while face down in a pillow, after ingesting alcohol and Xanax. Surveillance video showed Manzano and Colbert entering Manzano’s hotel room on the day he died. Colbert left an hour later. Police say she then used Manzano’s credit cards to make purchases in the area. As noted by the AP, Louisiana law defines second-degree murder as, in part, distributing drugs that cause death or committing certain crimes, like robbery, that result in death. Authorities said that Manzano had no prescription for Xanax, and that Xanax was found at Colbert’s home. The murder charge against White could potentially result in a plea deal in exchange for testimony that would be used to convict Colbert. Or, if the evidence is deemed to be strong enough, prosecutors could try to get a murder conviction of both defendants.

"Matthew Stafford, Rams will have another early offseason of uncertainty","In the NFL, no deal is ever done until it's done. NBC SPORTS",N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/matthew-stafford-rams-will-have-another-early-offseason-of-uncertainty?cid=nbcnews,"In the NFL, no deal is ever done until it’s done. Now that quarterback Matthew Stafford’s new deal with the Rams is officially done, the two-year deal will once again tee up the question, after the next season, of whether the Rams and Stafford are done. He ends up with $44 million this year, with no guarantees beyond 2025 — for injury or otherwise. The Rams will have until the fifth day of the next league year in March, when his 2026 salary of $40 million becomes fully guaranteed, to cut him. The Rams also will have the ability to trade Stafford, since they’ll hold his contractual rights through 2026. We don’t, and won’t, know whether the Rams have informally agreed to grant Stafford his outright release, if he decides he wants to finish his career elsewhere. If a new team can sign him without giving the Rams a draft pick or two, that’s more money they’ll be willing to pay Stafford next year. He could have gotten a firm $90 million (or more) on a two-year deal with the Raiders or Giants. But Stafford seems to be content to go one year at a time with the Rams, confident that another team (if not the Rams) will pay him fairly in 2026. It’s a good deal for the Rams. At $42 million per year on his new contract, Stafford currently ranks 15th in the NFL. And he’s still better than the 15th best quarterback. And Stafford, unlike plenty of starting quarterbacks, is willing to play in the current year with no financial security beyond it.

NFL declines comment on proposed White House cuts to TBI research and education,Commissioner Roger Goodell went to Washington on Monday. NBC SPORTS,N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-declines-comment-on-proposed-white-house-cuts-to-tbi-research-and-education?cid=nbcnews,"Commissioner Roger Goodell went to Washington on Monday. While he was standing in the Oval Office, a report emerged from ESPN.com regarding a White House proposal to slash millions from the budget for traumatic brain injury research and education. In response to an email from PFT, the NFL has declined comment on the development. It’s really no surprise. The league seems to be fully committed to achieving peaceful coexistence with the current administration. At a time when a slew of executive orders have various industries scrambling, the NFL is trying to make no sudden moves. Speaking out against the potential elimination of federal funding for a cause about which the NFL claims to be passionate would fall into that category. It will be far better — and, in the grand scheme of things, cheaper — for the NFL to fund TBI research and education efforts on its own. It’s part of the complex, but not all that complicated, dance in which the NFL must engage to properly navigate the current political waters. Basically, the strategy consists of avoiding the iceberg. And everybody knows what the iceberg is. As Goodell’s comments from Monday’s event proved, he’s willing to say all the right things, not say any of the wrong things, swallow his pride in the presence of someone who once called him a “dope,” and chart a course toward open waters and far smoother sailing than the likes of Harvard and multiple major law firms are currently experiencing. It’s not difficult to do it, once the decision is made to play the game with the overriding goal of winning. And the rewards include not only the avoidance of overt pressure to dump the Rooney Rule but also a draft in D.C., a stadium in D.C., and four years without holding their breath and waiting for a broadside attack against the league’s interests.

"Ravens made a ""football decision"" (wink, nod) about Justin Tucker","P.R. fallout be damned, the team carefully avoided a potential CBA issue. NBC SPORTS",N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/ravens-made-a-football-decision-wink-nod-about-justin-tucker?cid=nbcnews,"The Ravens have been in a delicate spot from the moment the first allegations surfaced in January against kicker Justin Tucker. On Monday, they made an indelicate exit from the relationship. On one hand, there have been no findings that Tucker has done anything wrong, in civil court, criminal court, or the Court of Commissioner Goodell. Indeed, Tucker has unequivocally denied the numerous accusations of misconduct during massage-therapy sessions. On the other hand, he plays a position that is as interchangeable as they come. Especially since Tucker has regressed from his previous perennial Pro Bowl-level performance. When faced with the choice between a run-of-the-mill kicker who is creating a significant distraction and is due to make $4.2 million this year and one who isn’t, it’s a no-brainer. And with run-of-the-mill kickers available anywhere and everywhere, the Ravens were always going to be moving on from Tucker. They opted to do the dance. To wait until after the start of the new league year in March, when Tucker could be released with a post-June 1 designation and significant 2025 cap savings. To wait until after they could use a sixth-round pick on Arizona kicker Tyler Loop, without their potential selection of a kicker during the draft being obvious. To wait until they could get a look at Loop during this weekend’s rookie minicamp. The fact that it was couched by G.M. Eric DeCosta as a “football decision” is no surprise. Players are released for football reasons all the time. There’s no mechanism in the Collective Bargaining Agreement for challenging the constant churn of football decisions. If the decision was influenced (as it likely was) in whole or in part by non-football reasons, the Ravens would have invited a potential CBA issue by saying so. At a minimum, Tucker could have argued under the “one punishment” principle that the team’s decision to release him in the aftermath of the allegations should short-circuit the pending Personal Conduct Policy investigation. (He still could.) This was all strategic and calculated by the Ravens, as all best-interests-of-the-team decisions are. After the Ravens’ 2024 playoff run ended, DeCosta said he expects Tucker to be the Ravens’ kicker in 2025. Then came the allegations. Instead of immediately applying a supposed “zero tolerance” policy to Tucker, the Ravens waited. They weathered a P.R. storm that was more like a light drizzle. And they were able to wait for the draft (and rookie minicamp) to come and go before making a move. On Sunday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh emphasized that the team would make football decisions only about Tucker. The next day, they made one. It most likely wasn’t only a football decision. But there’s no way to prove it, because the Ravens have said (and not said) all the right things about Tucker’s off-field situation. All that said, DeCosta’s statement seemed to be a little bit over the top. As noted by Brandon Kleen of AwfulAnnouncing.com, multiple members of the sports media have questioned the tone and content of the team’s announcement. The Ravens likely would prefer to be dragged until the next bright, shiny object distracts the media (i.e., tomorrow morning at the latest) than risk inviting an argument that they were influenced by Tucker’s off-field situation. Still, here’s what we (or at least I) think the Ravens would have said, if they were being candid and direct: “Justin has been a great kicker. Last year, he wasn’t as great as he’d been. We were willing to give him a chance to get back on track. But the off-field allegations became just too much. If it had been one or two people, we’d be willing to let it play out. But 16? It’s hard to think they all are lying, and he’s currently not good enough to justify circling the wagons until it plays out.” Obviously, they didn’t say it that way. And they’ll take some P.R. heat for it. Still, it will be very difficult for Tucker to do anything about it. And that likely has been the plan from the moment the Ravens realized they couldn’t and wouldn’t bring him back for 2025.

Jeff Zrebiec of TheAthletic.com reports the team will designate Tucker as a post-June 1 release. The move will allow the Ravens to spread out Tucker’s $7.5 million in dead cap money — the biggest dead cap hit in NFL history for a kicker — over two years. Tucker’s $4.2 million salary in 2025 was not guaranteed, so the Ravens will gain $4.2 million in cap space for 2025. Tucker signed a four-year, $22 million contract extension in August 2022, making him the league’s highest-paid kicker at the time. He had three years remaining on the deal. The Ravens drafted kicker Tyler Loop in the sixth round nine days ago, signaling the end to Tucker’s career in Baltimore. Tucker, 35, is subject of an NFL investigation into allegations by 16 massage therapists of inappropriate sexual behavior. Tucker has denied the allegations.

Ravens release Justin Tucker,"The move comes with Tucker under NFL investigation for misconduct, but the Ravens call it a football decision. NBC SPORTS",N/A,https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/ravens-release-justin-tucker?cid=nbcnews,"Kicker Justin Tucker is no longer a member of the Ravens. Ravens General Manager Eric DeCosta announced Tucker’s release via a statement on Monday afternoon. The move comes a day after Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said that an NFL investigation into misconduct allegations against Tucker was still in progress and that any decisions the team made about Tucker remaining on the roster would be football decisions related to drafting Tyler Loop in the sixth round. DeCosta used the same language in his statement. “Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,” DeCosta said. “Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker. Justin created many significant and unforgettable moments in Ravens history. His reliability, focus, drive, resilience and extraordinary talent made him one of the league’s best kickers for over a decade. We are grateful for Justin’s many contributions while playing for the Ravens. We sincerely wish him and his family the very best in this next chapter of their lives.” Tucker joined the Ravens in 2012 and has been named a first-team All-Pro six times during a run that leaves him with the highest field goal percentage in NFL history. He was less effective in 2024 and adding those results to the ongoing investigation led to Monday’s decision in Baltimore.
