How GM is trying to revive Cadillac as the quintessential American luxury car brand,The luxury vehicle market is crucial for automakers. The vehicles have higher profit margins than their mainstream counterparts and cater to a more affluent customer.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/gms-decade-long-battle-revive-cadillac-quintessential-american-luxury-rcna204845,"WARREN, Mich. — Walking into General Motors’ global design headquarters is like taking a step back in time. Much of the midcentury modern architecture and designs have remained untouched since the space opened in the 1950s. The massive tech campus was built during a time when the Detroit automaker reigned supreme. It was GM’s so-called Golden Era, with its luxury Cadillac brand leading the way as “the standard of the world” — before decades of U.S. market share declines amid increased competition from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and others. GM President Mark Reuss wasn’t alive to witness that era, but he’s harkened back to it as he and his teams have methodically overseen a product renaissance for Cadillac, which wants to regain its prominence as the American luxury brand. “There isn’t a lot of American luxury brands. There just isn’t. I think it’s time, and I’m deeply passionate about that, for GM and Cadillac to show the world what we can do,” Reuss told CNBC from his second-story office adjacent to the lobby. Cadillac’s domestic competition has historically been Ford Motor’s Lincoln luxury brand, which sells roughly a third of the vehicles in the U.S. as its GM competitor. Other luxury brands from Germany, Japan and, more recently, South Korea have entered the market as well. All-electric vehicle competitors Tesla and Lucid Group are also in the mix. The luxury vehicle market is crucial for automakers. The vehicles have higher profit margins than their mainstream counterparts and cater to a more affluent customer that views them as much as a status symbol as a mode of transportation. Reuss’ responsibilities as president include overseeing all the automaker’s products and brands, but he has always taken a special interest in Cadillac, which is on its fourth leader since 2015. Those involved with the brand have described Reuss as a protector, vanguard and even spiritual leader of sorts for Cadillac. While not everything has gone perfectly to plan — there have been issues with sales in China and electric vehicle production and adoption — Cadillac has largely stayed true to a plan that the company undertook to bolster the luxury brand a decade ago. It’s a not-so-easy accomplishment amid regulatory uncertainty and budget cuts in an automaker the size of GM. “If you would have looked at Cadillac’s financials and portfolio, it was not delivering,” Reuss said. “It’s been a long road taking a 150-year-old brand from where it was, which was not healthy. It was not ‘the standard of the world.’ Still isn’t. We’ve got work to do, but the vision is there and it’s pretty clear.” That vision currently relies heavily on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans and the brand’s flagship Escalade — one of GM’s longest-standing and most prominent nameplates — to bring Cadillac back to prominence. It’s a race Cadillac executives describe as having a never-ending finish line. In the summer of 2018, Reuss, GM design chief Michael Simcoe and then-Cadillac head Steve Carlisle, among others, mapped out what they wanted Cadillac to be ahead of a broader executive rollout at GM’s renowned design dome. It was a reevaluation of sorts of a plan laid out for Cadillac in 2015. The overall strategy was to largely isolate Cadillac’s products from GM’s other brands and not allow the sharing of consumer-focused parts. They would share some bones, motors and other powertrain parts, but the interiors and even some of the engines would be exclusively Cadillac. “We wanted to lay tracks down in terms of what the brand could be. We didn’t have a very consistent approach,” Carlisle recalled during a phone interview. “Many have tried and most have failed.” The idea was to get Cadillac’s portfolio back into shape with sporty, sleek vehicles that elevate the brand’s status and, in turn, lead to higher residual values of the vehicles. The brand also sought to lower incentives. Reuss, around that time, described it as Cadillac’s “one chance,” saying the Detroit automaker would “leave nothing on the table.” Cadillac has largely been able to get its house in order with most of those objectives, according to executives, auto analysts and industry metrics. “Right now, I think they’re in really good shape.” said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. “They have been more consistent with how to handle the Cadillac brand, and that’s going to continue to be incredibly important … consistency over time is one of the most important things you can do.” Cadillac decided to focus its future products to be all-electric vehicles, in a bid to compete with Tesla’s pricey Model Y and Model X at the time. The plan was for Cadillac EVs to eventually take the place of gas-powered models as soon as 2030, but now it’ll offer a full lineup of EVs as well as gas-powered vehicles. The first product released under the new strategy was the all-electric Lyriq that went on sale in 2022, but the pinnacle of the plan is the bespoke, $300,000 Celestiq that the brand is currently “relaunching.” The 2018 showing at the design dome — hallowed ground for the automaker — was crucial to sell the current vision of Cadillac, according to Simcoe, Carlisle and others involved. “In the dome, there was a vision for Celestiq and the Cadillac requirements,” Simcoe told CNBC from his corner design office overlooking the dome. “It was basically all the things that would define the brand. “There was a vision for the customers we’re addressing. There was a vision for the portfolio we needed. There was a vision for pretty much everything inside the business,” Simcoe said. The dome show took place after the exodus of Cadillac’s last president, Johan de Nysschen (all other Cadillac leaders since have been vice presidents), who had discussed the need for the brand to have its own vehicle platforms and powertrains. De Nysschen, an auto industry veteran who’s also led Audi and Infiniti, said he believes Cadillac “has made a lot of progress” since his departure. “I am pleased to say, in broad terms, that they’ve stayed true to the strategic direction that we had been agreed upon with GM top management,” he said during a phone interview. GM’s rule of thumb has been to prioritize “volume over value,” which includes achieving scale on mainstream models ahead of producing luxury vehicles such as Cadillacs. The strategy has helped GM’s profits but it’s been a challenge for Cadillac at times. It’s caused the brand to be late to vehicle segments and resulted in products such as the short-lived Cadillac ELR (a version of the Chevrolet Volt) a decade ago and, more recently, the outgoing XT6 crossover. That is no longer the case for Cadillac as it’s refocused, officials said. For example, there were expectations that GM would do a Cadillac version of the mid-engine Corvette, but Reuss said such a vehicle would not have fit into the brand’s new strategy, noting it would have shared a majority of components with the Corvette. “It was developed as a secondary car to the Corvette, on purpose. We would never do that,” Reuss said, citing potential room for additional specialty, Cadillac-specific vehicles outside of its $300,000-plus Celestiq. The all-electric Celestiq is a bespoke vehicle that the company is hand building at its tech and design campus in Warren. It was always meant to be low-volume production but orders as of the end of last year were only in the dozens. After delayed starts to production and sales, Reuss said GM is essentially relaunching the car after the automaker has gotten its software — a crucial part of the business — in order. “Just to be really transparent, we struggled launching our regular EVs, and so we’ve built our software capability to really execute and execute on time,” Reuss said. “We didn’t want to execute the car without everything being perfect on the software front. … To be honest, we’re relaunching the car.” First customer deliveries of the Celestiq are expected by midyear, according to the company, which declined to disclose how many orders it has received for the car. If successful, it could create a new two-unit business model for the company: one focused on hand-built, high-end vehicles and the other on mass-produced models. Wall Street is starting to once again take notice of Cadillac inside GM’s business, as other growth opportunities have faltered. “One of the real gems is Cadillac that we don’t think gets enough airtime and there’s huge opportunity,” BofA analyst John Murphy said at an investor conference last month with Cadillac’s current leader, John Roth. The decade-long plan for Cadillac also has the brand’s momentum building, particularly in North America — its home market. During the first quarter of this year, Cadillac reported an 18% increase in sales, including its best retail performance since 2008, Roth said. It hit that while offering among the lowest incentives as a percentage of sales price on record average transaction prices of $77,900. “That’s building brand health. That’s building brand value,” Roth, Cadillac global vice president, said at the BofA conference. “It’s a growth brand.” April sales were the brand’s best for that month since 2007, GM CEO Mary Barra said on a call Thursday. She noted all of its U.S. vehicles are produced in America — a potential advantage over German luxury brands and others. “So there is a huge opportunity for us to continue to build and leverage our product strength and the fact that these vehicles are built in the U.S.,” Barra said. Reuss declined to comment on potential impacts to Cadillac as a result of tariffs, but said the American brand is well positioned to continue to grow. While Cadillac grows domestically, Cadillac’s sales in China — its largest market for years until 2024 — have been in free fall. It’s an industrywide problem, as Chinese brands grow in the country, dominating Western brands such as Cadillac, BMW and others. “China is difficult for everyone. How Cadillac addresses that and improves that is not entirely in their control,” Brinley said. “Their products are strong, but I think the dynamics in China are just not in an imported brand’s favor right now.” Cadillac’s sales in China peaked at nearly 232,000 vehicles in 2021, representing 62% of Cadillac’s global sales. In 2024, Chinese sales totaled roughly 110,400 units, or 38%, of its 294,200 sales globally — marking the first time since 2015 that they’ve dropped below 300,000. Reuss, GM’s president, said China remains a focus for the automaker, which also is attempting to return to Europe with Cadillac. GM exited the market after selling its European operations in 2017. Reuss declined to discuss sales targets for Cadillac, but said both China and Europe continue to have a “major role” to play for the brand’ renaissance. “I think the way we execute vehicles globally will change, but Cadillac will be there with the latest and greatest, and we need to rebuild the sales capability, which we’re doing,” Reuss said. Cadillac last year remained off the winner’s podium in terms of sales. It was fifth in the U.S. and seventh globally, according to industry data confirmed by Cadillac. It trailed global leader BMW as well as Mercedes-Benz and Audi, among others. Roth last month said the brand’s success includes sales, but Cadillac’s goals are multifaceted and the race to profitably grow Cadillac continues. “We talk about Cadillac being the ‘standard of the world,’” Roth told investors last month. “Every day that standard never has a finish line. We keep moving that finish line, keep raising the bar on what the brand needs to stand for in the marketplace and keep growing and evolving the brand on a forward-looking basis.”","Michael Wayland, CNBC","May 5, 2025, 7:28 PM GMT+2 / Updated May 6, 2025, 1:38 AM GMT+2 / Source: CNBC"
"Air traffic control at Newark Airport briefly lost communication with aircraft, kicking off travel chaos","After the incident last week, the controllers from the Philadelphia TRACON took leave under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/air-traffic-control-newark-airport-briefly-lost-communication-aircraft-rcna204941,"Air traffic controllers temporarily lost communication with aircraft flying in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey last week, an incident that has continued to cause major delays at the travel hub. Last Monday, a ground stop was issued at Newark airport because of a Federal Aviation Administration equipment malfunction. The administration has still not clarified what the malfunction was. During the incident, air traffic controllers in Area C of the Philadelphia TRACON, a traffic control facility that guides flights in and out of Newark, lost communication with aircraft traveling to and from the airport, making them unable to see, hear or talk to them, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). The air traffic controllers are in charge of ""separating and sequencing aircraft in and out of Newark Airport."" It's not clear how long the air traffic controllers lost communication with the aircraft. The event led the air traffic controllers to take leave under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, which covers federal employees who are physically injured or experience traumatic events on the job, according to NATCA, a union that represents around 20,000 aviation professionals. While the union did not elaborate on what caused the communication loss, it said it supports Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's ""efforts to upgrade and modernize our nation’s air traffic control systems and infrastructure."" Since the incident, delays and cancellations of flights traveling into and out of Newark airport have been constant. Airlines, including United, have had to cancel hundreds of flights, and dozens of others have been diverted to other airports. Many issues contributed to the disruptions, including understaffing, construction and several instances of technical equipment failure. On Monday afternoon, over 300 flights traveling to and from Newark were delayed, and more than 150 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Bill Walker was one of the passengers whose flight was delayed Monday. ""We were delayed almost three hours in Seattle because they couldn’t get air clearance to come into Newark,"" Walker told NBC News. Other travelers weren’t as lucky. Ireland Hernandez, who was trying to get back home to Mexico, had an afternoon flight to Houston that got canceled. ""We came here just for the weekend and vacation, and we were planning to go back to Los Angeles,"" Hernandez said. ""But we have this connection flight from Newark to Dallas, and then we were driving to Mexico."" She was traveling with her friend Sarah Arce. They said they struggled to get answers or support from airline staff members. “They said, ‘We can’t give you a voucher,’” Arce said. United CEO Scott Kirby said the Philadelphia TRACON ""has been chronically understaffed for years,"" adding that ""Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead."" A shortage in air traffic controllers is an ongoing, nationwide problem. Duffy said that there are 3,000 vacant positions nationwide and that he plans to roll out a strategy to offer incentives to the labor force. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday in a letter to Duffy that there has been neglect in maintaining the air traffic control system, and he praised Duffy for working to hire more controllers. “Decades of underinvestment in the maintenance of critical air traffic control infrastructure, delays in upgrading to modern 21st century air traffic control technology, and inadequate air traffic control staffing have resulted in a frail system nationwide,” said Murphy, a Democrat. Murphy said thousands of passengers at Newark's airport have been affected. He said he was asking Duffy for more investment in New Jersey. The FAA said in a statement Monday that ""our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our workforce"" and that it is working to improve the reliability of communications in the New York City area. The FAA said that when there are staffing or equipment problems, it will slow arrivals in the interest of safety. ""We will keep the public updated as we work through these issues. The FAA will continue to be transparent with the public about the status of Newark and every airport,"" it said, directing people to its website.

Trump's Hollywood tariffs announcement is met with confusion and fear,A host of questions remain about how the president’s plan to slap duties on foreign productions would work.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-hollywood-movie-tariff-announcement-confusion-fear-why-rcna204856,"President Donald Trump’s Sunday night proposal to impose tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. has been met with a mix of confusion and fear by the entertainment industry. And by noon Monday, White House officials clarified that “no final decisions” had been made and that it was “exploring all options.” Trump’s initial proposal, posted to Truth Social, called for tariffs “on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” citing what he said was the harmful impact of incentives being offered by other countries. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN,” Trump wrote. Speaking from the Oval Office just before 2 p.m. Monday, Trump said he would be meeting with industry officials to make sure they were ""happy"" with his tariffs plan. ""I’m not looking to hurt the industry; I'm looking to help,"" he said. Industry officials and observers did not respond well to the initial plan. In a note to clients, analysts with Morgan Stanley called the idea “ill-defined,” noting 100% duties on some or all of the cost of a Hollywood production “would lead to fewer films, more expensive films, and lower earnings for all in the business.” “The reality is that for any given film, there can be writing, production, editing, post-production, visual effects — all done in different countries,” they wrote. The analysts noted Trump’s proposal failed to mention whether the tariffs would also apply to TV productions, what aspect of a production would be tariffed and how it would be charged, and whether the tariffs could be applied retroactively. The tariffs would hit as Hollywood continues to navigate one of the most difficult periods in its history, as social media, changing tastes and habits among viewers, the dawn of artificial intelligence, and the fallout from the writers strike have rattled the industry — and crimped box-office returns. Last year’s box office totaled just $8.75 billion, a 3% decline from 2023 and well off the $11 billion pre-pandemic average. It is true that Hollywood has increasingly opted to take production overseas, with Canada, New Zealand and especially the U.K. seeing some of the biggest jumps in spending and investment. Last year’s biggest live-action hits, “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Wicked” and “Dune: Part Two,” were filmed in studios outside the U.S. Yet unlike most sectors Trump has targeted for tariffs, the U.S. entertainment industry has a large trade surplus with the rest of the world, given continued foreign interest in American titles. Multiple Hollywood representatives declined to speak about Trump’s proposal or did not respond to requests for comment. The financial impact, meanwhile, was already being felt: In Monday trading, shares of most entertainment giants, like Netflix, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery, declined. The proposal also comes as Trump has appointed Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” to bring “lost business” back. Notably, all three men have supported Trump and espoused conservative-leaning views. White House officials initially referred additional questions about the proposed tariffs to the Commerce Department. In a post on X, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said “We’re on it” above an account that reposted Trump’s Truth Social post. Other analysts were more upbeat about the ability of content entities to avoid the tariffs. Analysts with Wedbush said, without firsthand knowledge of the White House’s vision, that as long as there was some element of a production performed in the U.S., a tariff could be “avoided or minimized.” They added that studios would likely move some production elements stateside to placate Trump, though this would eat into their profit margins. More substantially, the Wedbush analysts say they believe the entire tariffs episode could eventually subside. “Over the longer term, we expect foreign country reaction and the assertion of its constitutional authority by Congress to cause Trump to change his mind,” they wrote.

Social Security reduces benefit clawback from 100% to 50% for some,Beneficiaries may owe the Social Security Administration money due to overpayments — when their monthly benefit checks are more than what they are owed.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/social-security-reduces-benefit-clawback-100-50-experts-still-warn-dev-rcna204848,"Just weeks after announcing a 100% withholding rate on new overpayments of benefits, the Social Security Administration has slashed the rate down to 50% for certain beneficiaries. Yet that clawback on monthly benefit checks may still cause a financial burden for individuals who are affected, experts say. For new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25, the 50% default withholding rate will apply to so-called Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors and disability insurance, according to an emergency message released by the Social Security Administration. The withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains 10%. “Obviously, it’s better not to lose all of your income,” said Kate Lang, director of federal income security at Justice in Aging, a national organization focused on fighting senior poverty. “But if you’re relying on your benefits to pay your rent or your mortgage and buy food, losing half of that income is going to be devastating and can still result in people becoming homeless,” Lang said. Beneficiaries may owe the Social Security Administration money due to overpayments — when their monthly benefit checks are more than what they are owed. The erroneous payments can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if a beneficiary fails to report a change in their circumstances to the agency or if the agency does not process information promptly or enters errors in its data. When the Social Security Administration determines a beneficiary has been overpaid, a notice is sent to request a full and immediate refund, according to the agency. Beneficiaries typically have 90 days to request a lower rate of withholding, a reconsideration or waiver of recovery. If they do not make such a request within that 90-day window, the agency will withhold up to 50% of their benefits until the sum of the amount that was overpaid is fully recovered, according to the agency’s update. The Social Security Administration had previously announced that it would increase the default withholding rate for overpayments to 100%. Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the default withholding rate had been dropped to 10% of a beneficiary’s monthly benefit or $10 — whichever was greater. Generally, the rate beneficiaries are subject to is based on the terms at the time they were notified. “In the last 100 days, we’ve gone from as low as 10 [percent] to 100 and now to 50,” said Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans. The 100% withholding rate was “ridiculously draconian and cruel,” Fiesta said. The Social Security Administration had said the change to that full recovery rate would generate about $7 billion in program savings in the next decade, based on estimates from the chief actuary. Yet even with the default withholding rate cut in half, beneficiaries may still struggle financially. “Losing 50% [of benefits] for a lot of people could put them into immediate economic hardship,” Fiesta said. In most cases, it wasn’t the beneficiary’s fault that they were overpaid, Fiesta said. “They shouldn’t be put in a worse situation because of something they never caused in the first place,” he said. ‘A lot of discretion’ in negotiating repayment terms While beneficiaries do have the ability to negotiate the payments, there is no guarantee they will be successful and the outcomes may vary, according to Lang. “There are thousands of employees that individual beneficiaries are going to be dealing with to ask for a waiver or ask to negotiate a different repayment rate,” Lang said. “And those employees have a lot of discretion in what they decide.” Beneficiaries who are dealing with overpayment issues also face long wait times to make an appointment to visit a Social Security Administration office, which can interfere with their ability to exercise the options available to them, she said. The Social Security Administration did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment.","Lorie Konish, CNBC","May 5, 2025, 11:08 PM GMT+2 / Source: CNBC"
Rite Aid files for second bankruptcy in two years,"Rite Aid used its previous bankruptcy in 2023 to cut $2 billion in debt, close hundreds of stores, sell its pharmacy benefit company and negotiate settlements with its lenders.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/rite-aid-files-second-bankruptcy-two-years-rcna204958,"U.S. pharmacy chain Rite Aid on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in as many years, according to a court filing. Pharmacy chains, such as Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS, have been under pressure as falling drug margins and competition from Walmart and Amazon have led to a closure of hundreds of stores. Walgreens, facing significant losses, recently agreed to a $10 billion buyout by private equity firm Sycamore Partners — a dramatic decline from its $100 billion valuation a decade ago, underscoring the severe challenges facing traditional pharmacy retailers. Rite Aid used its previous bankruptcy in 2023 to cut $2 billion in debt, close hundreds of stores, sell its pharmacy benefit company, Elixir, and negotiate settlements with its lenders, drug distribution partner McKesson and other creditors. The previous bankruptcy also resolved hundreds of lawsuits alleging that Rite Aid ignored red flags when filling suspicious prescriptions for addictive opioid pain drugs. But despite those settlements, Rite Aid still had $2.5 billion in debt when it emerged from bankruptcy as a private company owned by its lenders in 2024. According to Monday’s court filing, the company has estimated assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion. The company was unable to secure additional capital from lenders, which it needed to continue operating the business, Bloomberg News reported earlier in the day, citing an internal letter from CEO Matthew Schroeder to the company’s employees. The letter also states that the drug store chain intends to reduce its workforce at its corporate offices in Pennsylvania. Rite Aid operated about 2,000 pharmacies in 2023 but now has only 1,250 stores across the U.S., with recent closures significantly reducing its presence in markets such as Ohio and Michigan.",Reuters,"May 5, 2025, 10:56 PM GMT+2 / Source: Reuters"
Trump set to raise millions from crypto and meme coin this month,"The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/trump-set-raise-millions-crypto-meme-coin-month-rcna204847,"President Donald Trump has two crypto-focused dinners on the calendar this month — one aimed at deep-pocketed political donors, the other at meme coin millionaires. Both are poised to help him rake in millions. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser set for Monday, is among the priciest political fundraisers in recent memory. The second, on May 22, offers access to Trump’s inner circle not for cash — but for holders of the $TRUMP token. Hosted by MAGA Inc., the “Crypto & AI Innovators Dinner” on May 5 features special guest David Sacks — who has been helping to rewrite the country’s crypto and artificial intelligence rules. The committee receiving the funds, MAGA Inc., is a super PAC that supports Trump. But given that the president is constitutionally barred from running for a third term, it’s unclear how the PAC plans to spend the millions of dollars it is raising this spring at a series of dinners. The crypto community has cheered Sacks’ growing influence in Washington, crediting him and other Trump-aligned appointees with a sweeping policy shift that’s already delivered a spate of regulatory wins across multiple federal agencies — in what many industry executives are describing as a 180 pivot from President Joe Biden. The second gala dinner will be held later this month at Trump National, the president’s private club in the Washington, D.C., area. The guest list will be decided by a blockchain-based contest run by the creators of the $TRUMP meme token. Instead of cash, entry is based on how many tokens a user holds, with the top 220 promised dinner with Trump himself. The contest runs through May 12. The gala, which is black tie optional, offers a “VIP White House Tour” and special reception to the meme coin’s 25-biggest holders. The website hosts an active leaderboard displaying the usernames of the coin’s top buyers. Accountable.US, a center-left watchdog group that investigates corporate and political influence, described the leaderboard contest as “the most nakedly corrupt self-enrichment scheme in U.S. presidential history,” warning it opens the door for wealthy donors — including potentially foreign actors — to buy access to the president, while personally enriching the Trump family. Because crypto wallets are pseudonymous, unless a holder has publicly disclosed their wallet address, it is difficult to independently confirm the identities of the top token holders currently leading the contest. In January, for example, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun upped his token stake in another Trump-related crypto project. The Tron blockchain founder disclosed that he holds $75 million worth of World Liberty Financial’s token. A court filing the following month showed that Sun and the Securities and Exchange Commission were exploring a resolution to the regulator’s civil fraud case against the crypto entrepreneur. The fine print of the $TRUMP contest does not guarantee access to the president. According to the site’s terms and conditions, Trump may not be able to attend and the event can be canceled “for any reason.” In that case, they’ll get a Trump NFT instead. Still, the contest has supercharged demand for the coin — and lined the pockets of its creators. The $TRUMP token surged more than 50% after the gala was announced, boosting the paper value of wallets controlled by insiders and early backers. Roughly 80% of the $TRUMP token supply is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliates, according to the project’s website. Since the token launched in January, trading activity has generated more than $324 million in trading fees for insiders, Chainalysis found. These fees are generated through the token’s built-in mechanism that routes a percentage of each trade to wallets controlled by the project — wallets that, according to the website, are linked to the coin’s creators. Insiders have agreed, however, to delay cashing out their share of tokens for at least another 90 days, according to the project’s public disclosures.

"Skechers to be acquired by 3G Capital in take-private deal, shares soar 25%","The price 3G Capital agreed to pay represents a 30% premium to Skechers’ current valuation on the public markets, which is in line with similar takeover deals.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/skechers-acquired-3g-capital-take-private-deal-shares-soar-25-rcna204846,"Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, ending its nearly three-decade run as a public company, the retailer announced Monday. The price 3G Capital agreed to pay represents a 30% premium to Skechers’ current valuation on the public markets, which is in line with similar takeover deals. Shares of Skechers soared more than 25% after the transaction was announced. “With a proven track-record, Skechers is entering its next chapter in partnership with the global investment firm 3G Capital,” Skechers’ CEO, Robert Greenberg, said in a news release. “Given their remarkable history of facilitating the success of some of the most iconic global consumer businesses, we believe this partnership will support our talented team as they execute their expertise to meet the needs of our consumers and customers while enabling the Company’s long-term growth,” he said. The transaction comes at a difficult time for the retail industry and in particular, the footwear sector, which relies on discretionary spending and overseas supply chains that are now in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Last week Skechers signed onto a letter penned by the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group asking for an exemption from Trump’s tariffs. And, a little over a week ago, Skechers withdrew its full-year 2025 guidance “due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies” as companies brace for a drop in consumer spending that will disproportionately impact the footwear and apparel sectors. Skechers declined to say how much of its supply chain is based in China, which is currently facing 145% tariffs, but cautioned that two-thirds of its business is outside of the U.S. and therefore won’t see as much of an impact. A source close to the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details said the trade environment didn’t force Skechers into a deal and that 3G Capital had been interested in acquiring the company for years. Tariffs do present some uncertainty in the short term, but 3G Capital believes the long-term outlook of Skechers’ business remains attractive and is well positioned for growth, the person said.

U.S. crude oil prices fall after OPEC+ agrees to surge production in June,"The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed Saturday to increase output by 411,000 more barrels per day in June.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/energy/us-crude-oil-prices-fall-opec-agrees-surge-production-june-rcna204844,"U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 2% on Monday, after OPEC+ agreed to surge production for a second month. U.S. crude was down $1.55, or 2.66%, at $56.74 a barrel by 10:26 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent fell $1.45, or 2.37%, to $59.84 per barrel. Oil prices have fallen about 20% this year. The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed on Saturday to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June. The decision comes a month after OPEC+ surprised the market by agreeing to surge production in May by the same amount. The June production hike is nearly triple the 140,000 bpd that Goldman Sachs had originally forecast. OPEC+ is bringing more than 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market over the course of two months. Oil prices in April posted the biggest monthly loss since 2021, as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have raised fears of a recession that will slow demand at the same time that OPEC+ is quickly increasing supply. “Our key conviction remains that high spare capacity and high recession risk skew the risks to oil prices to the downside despite relatively tight spot fundamentals,” Daan Struyven, Goldman’s head of oil research, told clients in a Sunday note. The investment bank cuts its forecast for U.S. crude prices this year by $3 to $56 per barrel. Oilfield service firms such as Baker Hughes and SLB are expecting investment in exploration and production to decline this year due to the weak price environment. “The prospects of an oversupplied oil market, rising tariffs, uncertainty in Mexico and activity weakness in Saudi Arabia are collectively constraining international upstream spending levels,” Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said on the company’s first-quarter earnings call on April 25. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon reported first-quarter earnings last week that fell compared to the same period in 2024 due to lower oil prices.","Spencer Kimball, CNBC","May 5, 2025, 4:49 PM GMT+2 / Source: CNBC"
New college grads face a tougher job market — again,Pessimism runs high in the class of 2025 after entry-level hiring prospects have tightened for two years straight and a student debt crackdown begins.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/new-college-grads-face-tougher-job-market-rcna204249,"This year’s new college graduates are heading into a tougher job market than last year’s — who had it worse off than the class before that — just as the Trump administration cracks down on student loan repayments. Recent grads’ unemployment rate was 5.8% as of March, up from 4.6% a year earlier, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported last week. The share of new graduates working jobs that don’t require their degrees — a situation known as “underemployment” — hit 41.2% in March, rising from 40.6% that same month in 2024. “Right now things are pretty frozen,” Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said of entry-level prospects. “A lot of employers and job seekers are both kind of deer-in-headlights, not sure what to do.” Employers and job seekers are both kind of deer-in-headlights, not sure what to do. ALLISON SHRIVASTAVA, ECONOMIST, INDEED HIRING LAB That squares with Julia Abbott’s experience. “I just feel pretty screwed as it is right now,” said the psychology major who’s graduating this month from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. She said she’s applied to over 200 roles in social media and marketing, but “minimal interviews come out of it.” Internship postings typically rise sharply in early spring, but they’re lagging 11 percentage points behind last year’s levels, Indeed said in April. The hiring platform sees demand for interns as a stronger gauge of new grads’ job prospects than entry-level postings, which increasingly target people with at least a few years’ experience. In a worrying sign for the class of 2025, internship openings are “far below where they were in 2023 and 2022, when the labor market was exceptionally competitive,” Shrivastava said. Young college grads have historically seen lower unemployment levels than the labor force overall, and they still do. But as The Atlantic pointed out Wednesday, this gap has narrowed to a record low, taking some of the shine off the traditional benefits of a bachelor’s degree. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is restarting the “involuntary” repayment of federal student loans in default, a move that could sap money from paychecks, tax refunds, Social Security payments and disability and retirement benefits from millions of borrowers. Repayments were paused during President Donald Trump’s first term in 2020 in response to Covid-19. The pandemic-era reprieve from forced collections ends Monday, just as a new TransUnion report finds a record share of federal student loan borrowers are 90 days or more past due and at risk of default — at 20.5% as of February, up 10 percentage points from five years earlier. The debt crackdown comes as workers across the labor force confront a tougher hiring landscape. Employers added a better-than-expected 177,000 jobs in April, government data showed Friday, but analysts were quick to flag warning signs ahead. Average pay growth has slowed to a crawl, and unemployment metrics indicate it’s taking longer for people looking for work to secure it. While the latest jobs numbers point to a “resilient” labor market, “we should curb our enthusiasm going forward given the backdrop of trade policies that will likely be a drag on the economy,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in a statement Friday. “The outlook remains very uncertain.” The murky jobs forecast coincides with broader economic turbulence fueled by Trump’s ongoing trade war. A slew of major companies have warned about tariff impacts in recent days. All but the wealthiest households are tightening their budgets, and consumer outlooks plunged to a 13-year low in a closely watched Conference Board survey released Tuesday. Some of the spending that is taking place reflects shoppers and businesses racing to make purchases before tariffs drive up costs for everything from cars to frozen fish and fireworks. These headwinds are making many employers increasingly cautious about hiring young graduates. Employers have pulled back plans to hire more new grads over just the last six months, according to a February and March survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, which polled major companies including Chevron, PepsiCo and Southwest Airlines. While most said their new-grad recruitment plans are holding steady, the share of respondents planning to expand entry-level hiring dipped to 24.6% this spring. That’s down from 27% last fall and the lowest rate since autumn 2020, during the depths of the pandemic. In March, NACE released salary projections showing a mixed picture for the class of 2025, with social sciences graduates set to see a 3.6% drop in pay since last year, while agriculture and natural resources majors were on track for a 2.8% bump over their ’24 predecessors. The estimates, however, were based on employer survey data from last fall, weeks before Trump took office. “I’m not surprised that new hiring is being restricted,” said Andy West, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey who advises CEOs on corporate strategy and finance. He said some clients are increasingly discussing ways to “reallocate resources” amid tariffs and other macroeconomic worries, he said. As employers hunt for cost cuts and stability, many tend to zero in on expenses that fluctuate over time, including payrolls. It just feels really scary, like walking into this world and not having something set out for me. JULIA ABBOTT, JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY, CLASS OF 2025 “When it comes to hiring and talent, often these are very short-term decisions around slowing down,” he said. Class of ’25 job seekers are adjusting their expectations to the tighter market. More than half have ditched the “dream job” plans they entered college with, according to a February survey by the grads-focused hiring platform Handshake. And 56% of current seniors are somewhat or very pessimistic about launching into the workforce right now. That’s about the same share as last year, but outlooks are down more sharply in fields like computer science, where over a quarter of seniors with that major voiced extreme pessimism. Anxiety around landing a first full-time job is common among college students, but the deep uncertainty this year threatens to put a damper on commencement season. “I can’t really celebrate my past four years,” said Abbott, the JMU senior. “It just feels really scary, like walking into this world and not having something set out for me.” J.J.

Trump says he'll call CEOs when he disagrees with their business decisions,Retailers have increasingly offered warnings about the tariffs' impact on consumers.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-call-ceos-plans-prices-tariffs-rcna204702,"President Donald Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” in an interview that he’d use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary. The call occurred after Punchbowl News reported that Amazon was going to begin to list tariff charges on certain Amazon purchases in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to impose 145% tariffs on China. ""He’s just a very nice guy,"" Trump said of Bezos in an interview that aired Sunday. ""We have a relationship. I asked him about [the tariff charge language Amazon considered including in listings]. He said, 'Well, I don’t want to do that,' and he took it off immediately."" Trump and Bezos appear to have developed a closer relationship in the last few months than they had during Trump’s first administration. In December, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and Bezos attended his swearing-in ceremony. Bezos stepped down as the company's CEO in 2021, but he is still its executive chairman. Indeed, in a statement shortly after the Punchbowl report, an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News, ""The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen.” Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told moderator Kristen Welker: ""Sure. I’ll always call people if I disagree with them."" ""If I think that somebody’s doing something that’s incorrect, wrong or maybe hurtful to the country, I’ll call,"" he added. ""Wouldn’t you want me to call? [Former President Joe] Biden wouldn’t call because he didn’t know what was happening, but I do."" In the interview, Trump defended his decision to impose major tariffs on imports from China, saying the move is supposed to give companies incentives to build factories in the United States to avoid paying tariffs, not simply raise prices on consumers to offset the cost of tariffs. ""I don’t view it as a tax. I view it as an incentive for people to come into the United States and build plants, factories, offices, a lot of things. I think it’s an incentive,"" he told Welker. ""What people don’t understand is, and this is a lot, the country eats the tariff. The company eats the tariff. And it’s not passed along at all,"" he added. Several other major online retailers, like Temu, a low-cost retail site based in China, have already begun charging consumers tariff fees, adding a line item on purchases that's listed as “import charges.” Other popular American retailers, like Béis, Bare Necessities and Fashion Nova, have urged consumers to shop more in the near term, predicting that imposing future tariffs could force them to raise prices. Larger companies, like PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, have issued similar warnings, telling shareholders in recent meetings that they're already seeing the impacts of tariffs on earnings. Trump has acknowledged that tariffs could have an impact on the availability of consumer goods in the near term. Asked whether his remark about children having fewer toys during a Cabinet meeting was an acknowledgment that tariffs would cause prices to rise, Trump told Welker: ""I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls, because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable."" Trump made a similar remark at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, telling members of his administration: ""Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” But he pushed back against the assertion that he was predicting price hikes or supply shortages due to tariffs. ""I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,"" he said, adding, ""we don’t have to waste money on a trade deficit with China for things we don’t need, for junk that we don’t need.""

Stocks unleash remarkable comeback after a historic dive from Trump's tariffs announcement,The S&P 500 has notched its longest winning streak in 20 years after suffering some of its worst-ever drawdowns.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stocks-unleash-remarkable-comeback-after-volatile-month-trump-tariffs-rcna204213,"In the week following President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement, it looked like the stock market had seen a ghost. Over the course of seven days following his April 2 announcement, the S&P 500 lost more than 12%, a decline not typically seen outside of extreme events like the Covid-19 pandemic and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. That stretch last month also saw the fifth-worst two-day percentage decline since World War II. Government bond yields, too, began to creep steadily upward, making it more expensive for the U.S. to borrow money, amid signs that both the substance and erratic rollout of Trump’s tariff plan were testing traders’ faith in the United States’ ability to make timely payments on its debt. Stocks around the world sold off, too. “April was an absolutely seismic month in financial markets, as the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs led to a huge global sell-off,” analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients Thursday. “The initial moves were truly historic in their speed.” With the stock and bond markets blaring red alerts, Trump backed off some of his tariffs on April 9, triggering euphoria among investors. After he announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs for “non-retaliating” countries, the S&P saw its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, with a 9.5% gain. At the same time, the sell-off in Treasurys stabilized. Now, 32 days after the historic Rose Garden speech, stocks have executed a stunning comeback of sorts, with the broader market largely returning to where it was when the “Liberation Day” tariffs were first announced. Volatility in government borrowing costs, too, has leveled off. The gains are relative: Stocks remain about 6% below their pre-Inauguration Day levels. But some blue chip companies like Apple are still hobbling. The iPhone maker’s stock is down more than 20% since its all-time high last winter, though partly for reasons beyond the president’s policies. Tesla, which is helmed by Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, is still 40% off its December peak. Nevertheless, the broader recovery has been significant. According to Dow Jones, the eight trading days through Thursday last week saw the biggest gain for the S&P 500 since November 2020, when markets showed their first signs of recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. And with Friday’s close, the index saw its longest winning streak in 20 years. Experts say the recovery has been fueled by a combination of Trump’s softening tone on tariffs and investors entering an “acceptance” stage that whatever the president ends up saying, tariffs are here to stay in some form or another. “Markets are adjusting to the tariffs story and saying, ‘OK, this has happened, now what do we do about it?’” said Roxanna Islam, head of research at VettaFi, an asset management platform. “People are starting to look more forward than backward.” If flows of money into a popular low-cost investment vehicle are any indication, the recovery has been led by so-called “retail” investors, opportunistic buyers who are more apt to make daily market trades. That group stands in contrast to longer-term investors like 401(k) holders or large institutions, which typically take a more measured, long-term view of investing. According to the Vanguard investment group, which runs investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), “bulls,” or net buyers of stocks, outnumbered “bears” (net sellers) by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1 among self-directed investors. The Vanguard ETF saw a $21 billion inflow last month, the most in its 15-year history and the fifth-largest amount ever taken in by a fund on a monthly basis, Bloomberg News reported. “It would be simplistic to say it’s just retail — but to a large extent it has been,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at the Interactive Brokers financial group. The retail investment boom surfaced during the pandemic, when day traders turned to playing markets amid nationwide shutdowns. The trend became best known for fueling mania in “meme” stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond that would see intense run-ups in price amid online speculation about company turnarounds. The meme-stock days have largely faded, but the impulse to “buy the dip” — the popular phrase used to describe when investors bet on stock prices rising after they’ve gone down — remains, Sosnick said. “I think the key element has been American investors’ unrelenting faith that every dip is a buying opportunity,” he said. “And if enough have this faith, it can make itself true.” The recovery remains extremely fragile. Stocks are highly sensitive to any hints of trade deals, especially with China, which was excluded from Trump’s initial tariff pause. As recently as Friday, stocks surged on a Wall Street Journal report that China was open to addressing Trump’s concerns about its role in the fentanyl crisis as an entry point for both sides softening their trade dispute. And the overall economic picture remains uncertain. Despite a strong jobs report Friday, other indicators suggest the economy is throttling back. Economic growth was negative for the first three months of the year, and while much of that was a function of a surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to a 1.8% quarterly gain after surging to a 4% gain in the fourth quarter last year. Friday’s jobs report also showed the median duration of unemployment is surging and average hourly earnings growth is slowing. Companies, too, are lowering their financial guidance for the year, or withdrawing it as they await clarity on how Trump’s tariffs shake out. As a result, overall investment sentiment remains bearish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), whose regular survey most recently showed that expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 3.7 percentage points to 59.3%. “Bearish sentiment is unusually high and is above its historical average of 31.0% for the 22nd time in 24 weeks,” the AAII said. “Bearish sentiment has now been above 50% for 10-consecutive weeks, the longest period over 50% in the survey’s history.” Even for people without direct exposure to the stock market, the negative sentiment can have an impact on the broader economy, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. “Those negative headlines do take a toll beyond those who have a particular stake in the market,” he said. There are also signs that the “Sell America” trade is lingering, according to Bob Elliott, CEO of the Unlimited Funds investment group, who noted in a post on X Friday that the value of the U.S. dollar remains well below where it was just before Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, while gold and foreign stocks have been outperforming U.S. equities. There’s been a “rotation away from the U.S.” even with better-than-expected data, Elliott said. In short, it remains to be seen where the market goes from here. “It’s still early,” said Islam, of VettaFi. “There’s still a lot of that uncertainty.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.",Rob Wile,"May 4, 2025, 12:00 PM GMT+2"
Major delays at Newark Liberty Airport wreak havoc with weekend travel plans,United Airlines canceled dozens of flights at Newark following a chaotic week of travel that left some passengers dealing with massive delays.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/delays-newark-airport-weekend-rcna204623,"The skies above the Garden State are not so friendly this weekend if you’re flying into or out of New Jersey’s Newark Liberty Airport. Delays averaged just under two hours out of Newark by late Saturday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. United CEO Scott Kirby said his airline had to cancel dozens of flights at Newark following a chaotic week of travel that left some passengers dealing with massive delays. “United is committed to doing absolutely everything in our power to minimize the impact that this will have on customers and so we are unilaterally cancelling 35 roundtrip flights per day from our Newark schedule starting this weekend,” Kirby’s statement said. In addition to United, hundreds more flights at Newark were completely canceled, and dozens more were diverted to other airports because of the chaotic scene in New Jersey. Some of the main issues causing travel disruptions involved construction, several instances of technical equipment failure and understaffing. One of the runways at Newark is closed until mid-June because of construction, limiting the operation capacity to the 76 U.S. cities and 81 international countries it services. Jaki Maurey-Delaunay experienced delays as she was flying in from London Saturday afternoon with her son. “We live in London, family is important to us. It’s not a cheap ticket so every minute counts for us,” she said. The pair were traveling to Newark just for 24 hours to make a family event. “I got an alert Thursday. They were asking me if I wanted to change my flight. They were actually sending an alert asking if I wanted to change my flight because of congestion but I was like, ‘I can’t change my flight, I need to get there’. So I was a bit panicked getting to the airport,” she said. The extreme delays this week rippled out to other airports across the country and altered thousands of passengers’ travel plans. There have also been staffing issues at the Philadelphia TRACON, a traffic control facility that guides flights in and out of Newark. “Keep in mind, this particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, it’s now clear — and the FAA tells us — that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,” Kirby said. The staffing issues, particularly involving air traffic controllers, are a nationwide problem. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said there were some 3,000 vacant positions nationwide and he’s planning to roll out a strategy to incentivize the labor force. According to a statement released by the FAA, the plan includes financial incentives to try and ease the declining workforce numbers. The plan also includes recruiting military controllers, providing bonuses for academy graduates and working with controllers nearing the end of their career to attempt to get them to stay until the required retirement age of 56.

How tariffs are affecting the Kentucky Derby,Uncertainty over the economy due to President Donald Trump’s oscillating tariff policies looms large over America’s longest running sporting event.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/taxes/tariffs-are-affecting-kentucky-derby-rcna204533,"There are no sure things on the Churchill Downs racetrack — and this year, there are few sure things around the track as well. Uncertainty over the economy due to President Donald Trump’s oscillating tariff policies looms large over America’s longest running sporting event and the most exciting two minutes in sports — the Kentucky Derby. The track itself has put some projects on hold. Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby “Uncertainty is a theme out there in the American economy, and that’s one we pay attention to,” said Bill Carstanjen, CEO of Churchill Downs. “So we did pause our $900 million construction project primarily, and mostly because we weren’t sure what things were going to cost. And whenever you build something, you’ve got to be very careful on the cost side.” Churchill Downs announced last week it was pausing a major renovation project it had announced in February due to the uncertainty in the economy and Trump’s tariffs. The racetrack had planned to debut these renovations during the next year’s racing season, including more than 20,000 new seats, 36 luxury suites and upgrades to the infrastructure. But the higher price of steel — crucial to construction — and supply chain interruptions, created a “double whammy” for Churchill Downs. Carstanjen said the tariffs and current economic environment created “unanticipated and currently unquantifiable expected cost increases in materials.” While the 151st Kentucky Derby is on track to meet its normal attendance, Carstanjen did see some hesitance in sales this year, particularly in the lower-tier tickets. In addition to ticket sales, Carstanjen said Churchill Downs is seeing overall “softness” in some areas of betting, including a slip in sports wagering to the tune of more than $1 million. He blamed faltering consumer confidence. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat in a largely Republican state, called Trump’s tariffs an “attack on American people” and noted that both Republican senators from his state have also criticized the president’s economic strategy. “The president’s current tariff plan is causing chaos in our economy,” he said at a press conference Thursday. “It is slowing our economic growth. It’s hitting large businesses, with UPS announcing a lot of layoffs. It’s hitting small and medium-sized businesses.” Many Derby goers were cognizant of Churchill Downs’ announcement, especially those who were impressed by this year’s renovations. Ed Massey of New Jersey has been coming to the Derby for decades. “Tariffs are not going to get in the way of the 151-year Derby spirit,” he told NBC News. “But I do worry about the future growth of the event. The Derby will outlast any tariffs, but will it be able to grow? That remains to be seen.” Horse racing and betting aren’t the only two Kentucky staples that are taking a hit from the tariffs. Economic experts in the state say they’ve already seen an impact on agriculture, energy, manufacturing and bourbon — which has a $9 billion impact in Kentucky. “A billion-dollar investment is more than just what it means for the track — that will have a ripple effect on the economy in the region,” said Kate Shanks, vice president of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. “You’ve got to purchase lumber. You’ve got to purchase glass, steel, hire electricians, HVAC workers, and we were eager to see that happen. And now that’s been paused, and it’s absolutely going to have an impact on jobs in the region.” According to the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the state has approximately 480,000 jobs that depend on trade. The chamber estimated these tariffs will cost the average Kentuckian up to $1,200 per year.

Warren Buffett to ask board to make Greg Abel CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end,"Buffett noted he would still ‘hang around’ to help, but the final word on company operations would be with Abel, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations for Berkshire.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/warren-buffett-greg-abel-ceo-succession-rcna204634,"OMAHA, Nebraska — An end of an era was announced in Omaha Saturday as Warren Buffett said he will soon ask the board of Berkshire Hathaway to have Greg Abel replace him as CEO at year end. While Buffett is 94 and Abel was designated as CEO successor in 2021, it nonetheless came as surprise to the thousands of admiring shareholders gathered for this year’s annual meeting to once again hear the investing legend opine on the future of the company. “Tomorrow, we’re having a board meeting of Berkshire, and we have 11 directors. Two of the directors, who are my children, Howie and Susie, know of what I’m going to talk about there. The rest of them, this will come as news to, but I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” said Buffett, in the final few minutes of the meeting. Buffett, who took over as CEO of the former textiles company in 1965, said he will still ‘hang around’ to help, but the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations for Berkshire. “I could be helpful, I believe, in that in certain respects, if we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything,” he added. Buffett, who owns more than $160 billion in Berkshire as its largest shareholder, said he wouldn’t sell a single share of the stock after he transitions to this new phase. “I would add this, the decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,” said Buffett, who used a cane to walk around the meeting, but answered questions for four hours with surprising energy and clarity for his age. Buffett sang Abel’s praises in front of some 40,000 shareholders Saturday, saying his more hands-on managerial style is working better for Berkshire’s 60-plus subsidiaries. Abel is based in Des Moines, Iowa. “It’s working way better with Greg than with me because, you know, I didn’t want to work as hard as he works,” Buffett said. “I could get away with it because we’ve got a basically good business, very good business.” The Canadian executive, born in Edmonton, Alberta, has a 25-year tenor at Berkshire under his belt. Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 when the conglomerate bought MidAmerican Energy, where he eventually became the CEO in 2008. Prior to that, Abel worked at CalEnergy where he transformed the small geothermal firm into a diversified energy business. “I think they’ll be unanimously in favor of it,” Buffett said of the board’s pending CEO decision Sunday. Buffett and Abel told CNBC’s Becky Quick after the shareholder meeting that the pair would discuss at the Sunday board meeting what Buffett’s role will be formally next year. Buffett is currently also chairman of the conglomerate. So it’s not clear whether Abel will also assume the chairman role. Buffett told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that his son Howie Buffett would become nonexecutive chairman after his death to preserve the company culture. It’s not clear whether this move will impact that decision. “It surprises me, but it impresses me,” said Ron Olson a Berkshire board director, after the shareholder meeting Saturday. “I am very anxious to see Warren become the Charlie Munger for Greg Abel.” After the surprise announcement that apparently Abel didn’t even know was coming, the meeting ended with a standing ovation for Buffett.","John Melloy, CNBC","May 3, 2025, 8:27 PM GMT+2 / Updated May 3, 2025, 8:44 PM GMT+2"
Retailers are turning the trade war into a sales event,Buy now or pay later: Brands beg shoppers to spend before Trump’s tariffs hit their prices.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/retailers-are-turning-trade-war-sales-event-rcna204066,"The add-to-cart callouts are widespread, and lately they’re coming with a trade war twist: buy now to beat the tariffs. Retailers and e-commerce brands have been flooding social media in recent weeks with appeals to shoppers’ well-founded fears that President Donald Trump’s import taxes will raise prices, urging them to act now before that happens. “Tariffs are rising — but our prices aren’t (for now)!” promised DTG Pro, a printing equipment seller, in a recent Instagram post with a 10% discount code. “Unfortunately, the bridal industry is not excluded from the rising tariffs, so take advantage of our pre-tariff SAMPLE SALE until 4/15, when we will be forced to raise our prices!” New York-based Adrienne’s Bridal posted last month. The marketing blitz comes amid souring consumer attitudes that have already fueled a buying spree among businesses and ordinary shoppers alike. The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter as consumers scooped up foreign goods and companies raced to stockpile materials and inventories before steeper levies hit their supply chains. While Trump’s tariff policies have rolled out erratically for weeks, many foreign goods are already pricier than they were just months ago. Despite a series of partial walk-backs and temporary reprieves on a range of imports, key parts of the president’s trade agenda are just now kicking in. With the costs of many foreign-made auto parts set to jump by 25% this weekend, automakers have seen vehicle sales spike by double-digits amid tariff fear-buying that they expect to peter out soon. Some dealerships are trying to keep that momentum going as long as they can. “Get your new vehicle before prices change!” Coastal Hyundai, a Melbourne, Florida-based dealership, told buyers as part of a “Tariff Free Savings Event.” Some promotions have leaned into the uncertainty around which duties might stick. “The Tariffs Are Coming… Or Are They? We’re as unsure as everyone else,” a custom sticker company posted in March, offering 12% off through the end of March. “If our costs go up, so will our prices. Now’s your chance to lock in savings before that happens.” There’s an expectation that certain products are going to be expensive, so having a promotion today is certainly very valuable. DULEEP RODRIGO, U.S. CONSUMER AND RETAIL LEAD, KPMG Half of U.S. consumers are actively seeking out discounts and promotions in their summer purchases, according to a recent survey by the accounting firm KPMG. More than 70% expect a recession within the next year. “In some cases, it’s certainly working,” Duleep Rodrigo, who leads U.S. consumer and retail consulting at KPMG, said of tariff-based marketing campaigns. “We’ve seen auto sales up. We’ve seen appliances pick up. There’s an expectation that certain products are going to be expensive, so having a promotion today is very valuable.” Some companies are taking a more somber tone, warning that tariffs could kill their business and appealing to customers to help keep them afloat without having to hike prices. “These may be uncertain times, but the kitchen is a refuge,” wrote Burlap & Barrel, a seller of single-origin spices, in an April Instagram post. Pledging to keep its $10 price cap and free shipping minimum — and to continue its revenue-sharing program with smallholder farmers — the company added that it was “extending our biggest sale ever, up to 20% off sitewide.” Many of the brands trying to drum up shoppers’ support appeared to be smaller retailers and startups that sell and market heavily online. Small businesses have warned in recent weeks that tariffs pose an existential threat, saying they have less leeway than big corporate rivals to shake up their suppliers or absorb higher costs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents some 3 million companies ranging from corporate juggernauts to Main Street operators, appealed to the White House on Wednesday for exclusions from the import taxes to spare small businesses from “irreparable harm.” Some e-commerce companies have already taken to social media to announce tariff-driven changes, like a shutdown in shipments to U.S. customers. A White House spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Retail analysts said even the more opportunistic-sounding marketing reflects businesses’ efforts to adapt to the evolving trade landscape. “There are all these legitimate financial reasons why you might need to have a sale now, or need to lower your pricing now, or need to change your marketing message to try to drive more sales now,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe and founder of the retail media company Retailgeek. Many entrepreneurs could be thinking: “I can lean into it and drive some additional sales — and if I don’t, one of my competitors might,” Goldberg said. “We’re seeing real moves that are economically necessitated, and we’re seeing opportunistic marketing, very often from the same people.” We’re seeing real moves that are economically necessitated, and we’re seeing opportunistic marketing, very often from the same people. JASON GOLDBERG, CHIEF COMMERCE STRATEGY OFFICER, PUBLICIS GROUPE Other companies are taking a more openly political stance with “anti tariff” sales, and recasting online shopping as a form of resistance. “Donald Trump’s tariffs are a terrible deal for, well, everyone,” Charles Ryan, partner and chief operating officer at Monte Cook Games, wrote in a February blog post. Noting that virtually all of its books, games and card decks were manufactured in Canada or China, both of which Trump has targeted with tariffs, Ryan promised a 25% discount on all existing physical products. The company, which has decades-old ties to the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, produces two to four years of supply at a time, Ryan said in emailed comments. That means most of its inventory is now sitting on warehouse shelves, while the 15-20 new products Monte Cook makes each year are a “different story,” he said. For its next big tabletop game, the brand is already working to keep costs down by producing many of its components in ""no- or low-tariff territories"" and assembling the project in its home state of Kansas — approximating the type of outcome the Trump administration has repeatedly said its levies are meant to spur. “The coming impact of these tariffs is going to be terrible for business and consumers of all stripes. If we can offset some of that through a period of higher sales now, that’s good for us,” Ryan said. “If it reassures our fans that their hobby isn’t going to be destroyed right away, and lets them save a few bucks, it’s hard to see a downside to that.” J.J.

Temu halts shipping direct from China as de minimis tariff loophole is cut off,"The loophole, which allowed items worth $800 or below to enter the U.S. duty-free since 2016, expired Friday as an executive order signed by Trump last month.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/temu-halts-shipping-direct-china-de-minimis-tariff-loophole-cut-rcna204597,"Chinese bargain retailer Temu changed its business model in the U.S. as the Trump administration’s new rules on low-value shipments took effect Friday. In recent days, Temu has abruptly shifted its website and app to only display listings for products shipped from U.S.-based warehouses. Items shipped directly from China, which previously blanketed the site, are now labeled as out of stock. Temu made a name for itself in the U.S. as a destination for ultra-discounted items shipped direct from China, such as $5 sneakers and $1.50 garlic presses. It’s been able to keep prices low because of the so-called de minimis rule, which has allowed items worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free since 2016. The loophole expired Friday at 12:01 a.m. EDT as a result of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in April. Trump briefly suspended the de minimis rule in February before reinstating the provision days later as customs officials struggled to process and collect tariffs on a mountain of low-value packages. The end of de minimis, as well as Trump’s new 145% tariffs on China, has forced Temu to raise prices, suspend its aggressive online advertising push and now alter the selection of goods available to American shoppers to circumvent higher levies. A Temu spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that all sales in the U.S. are now handled by local sellers and said they are fulfilled “from within the country.” Temu said pricing for U.S. shoppers “remains unchanged.” “Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform,” the spokesperson said. “The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.” Before the change, shoppers who attempted to purchase Temu products shipped from China were confronted with “import charges” of between 130% and 150%. The fees often cost more than the individual item and more than doubled the price of many orders. Temu advertises that local products have “no import charges” and “no extra charges upon delivery.” The company, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has gradually built up its inventory in the U.S. over the past year in anticipation of escalating trade tensions and the removal of de minimis. Shein, which has also benefited from the loophole, moved to raise prices last week. The fast-fashion retailer added a banner at checkout that says, “Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You’ll never have to pay extra at delivery.” Many third-party sellers on Amazon rely on Chinese manufacturers to source or assemble their products. The company’s Temu competitor, called Amazon Haul, has relied on de minimis to ship products priced at $20 or less directly from China to the U.S. Amazon said Tuesday following a dustup with the White House that had it considered showing tariff-related costs on Haul products ahead of the de minimis cutoff but that it has since scrapped those plans. Prior to Trump’s second term in office, the Biden administration had also looked to curtail the provision. Critics of the de minimis provision argue that it harms American businesses and that it facilitates shipments of fentanyl and other illicit substances because, they say, the packages are less likely to be inspected by customs agents.

"Trump downplays recession fears, saying the U.S. would be 'OK' in the long term","Speaking to NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Trump said the U.S. is in a “transition period” but will “do fantastically” in the long run.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-downplays-recession-fears-saying-us-ok-long-term-rcna203511,"President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed concerns about potential economic trouble, saying everything would be “OK” in the long term, even if the U.S economy experienced a recession in the short term. Asked twice by “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker whether it would be OK in the long run if there were a recession in the short term, the president said, “Look, yeah, it’s — everything’s OK. What we are — I said, this is a transition period. I think we’re going to do fantastically.” Following up, Welker asked Trump if he was worried about a recession, to which he responded, “No.” Asked whether he thinks one could happen, Trump replied, “Anything can happen, but I think we’re going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.” The remarks come as analysts on Wall Street are increasingly worried that the country could face a recession due to Trump’s changing tariff policy. “Well, you know, you say, ‘Some people on Wall Street say’ — well, I tell you something else. Some people on Wall Street say that we’re going to have the greatest economy in history. Why don’t you talk about them?” Trump said during the interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “There are many people on Wall Street say this is going to be the greatest windfall ever happen,” the president added. According to initial measurements released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, the U.S. economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, a reduction largely driven by a fall in exports and a boost in imports ahead of Trump’s expected tariffs. On Wednesday, while meeting with members of his Cabinet, Trump deflected blame for the first-quarter gross domestic product numbers, saying they were a result of the economy former President Joe Biden left behind. “You probably saw some numbers today,” Trump said, “and I have to start off by saying, that’s Biden.” “That’s not Trump,” he added Wednesday. “Because we came in on January, these are quarterly numbers, and we came in and I was very against everything that Biden was doing in terms of the economy, destroying our country in so many ways.” Since the start of his administration in January, Trump has sought to impose tariffs on America’s largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Early last month, the president paused the introduction of larger tariffs on most countries for 90 days, just days after imposing them. His partial retreat fueled a rally in markets, which as of Friday recovered the losses they suffered after his initial tariff announcement on April 2. At the same time, Trump slapped even more tariffs on China, raising the tariff rate on the Asian nation to 145%. Still, the president has repeatedly dismissed concerns that the tariffs on China will have major effects on the prices or availability of consumer goods in the U.S. During the Cabinet meeting, he told reporters, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” Alexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.",Alexandra Marquez,"May 3, 2025, 12:53 AM GMT+2"
"Kohl's CEO fired for steering business to a person with whom he had a relationship, retailer says",An investigation by an outside law firm found that Ashley Buchanan had not disclosed the relationship as required by company policy.,N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kohls-ceo-fired-steering-business-person-relationship-retailer-says-rcna204441,"Kohl’s CEO Ashley Buchanan was fired this week because he had an undisclosed personal relationship with a vendor on a consulting team that made a multimillion-dollar deal with the retailer at his direction, the company said in a regulatory filing. Buchanan had only been in the role since January. An investigation by an outside law firm found Buchanan had violated company policies by directing the company to enter into “vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest,” the department store said. The Kohl’s board of directors terminated Buchanan for cause, the company said, and appointed board director Michael Bender as the interim CEO. Kohl’s said Buchanan’s firing was unrelated to the company’s performance and did not involve any other employees. Buchanan previously held the same position at the crafts retailer Michaels since 2020. He became Kohl’s chief executive in January. Kohl’s said Wednesday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the investigation found Buchanan had directed the company to “conduct business with a vendor founded by an individual with whom Mr. Buchanan has a personal relationship on highly unusual terms favorable to the vendor.” The filing said the unnamed person was also part of a consulting team that had entered into a multimillion-dollar agreement with Kohl’s under Buchanan’s direction. The regulatory filing said Buchanan did not disclose the relationship as required under company policy, and he will have to forfeit all equity awards and bonuses he received from Kohl’s when he was hired. He also will have to reimburse the company on a pro-rated basis for a $2.5 million signing bonus. Kohl’s did not disclose who the consulting agreement was with, but The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report Buchanan had been fired, said it was Boston Consulting Group, where Buchanan’s romantic partner, Chandra Holt, was an adviser. The Journal report cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. Buchanan and Holt did not immediately reply to requests for comment made by phone and email. Boston Consulting Group said in a statement to NBC News that it was “shocked to learn of the relationship between” Holt and Buchanan. “We have strict guidelines for our senior advisors to disclose any conflicts of interest,” Boston Consulting said, adding it had terminated Holt’s contract for nondisclosure. The Boston Consulting Group said Holt is a recognized industry expert who worked for the group on a part time basis and was paid by the hour. “She was not involved in structuring the project or negotiating any contract terms and was not expected to lead any part of the project,” the group said.

American Airlines to debut new suites with sliding doors after delays,"American first unveiled the new design in September 2022 and expected to start flying the new seats in 2024 but, like other carriers, faced delays from suppliers.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/american-airlines-debut-new-suites-sliding-doors-delays-rcna204457,"American Airlines’ new suites with sliding doors are set to start flying on some of its planes in June, a key part of its strategy to compete against more profitable rivals for high-spending customers. American first unveiled the new design in September 2022 and expected to start flying the new seats in 2024 but, like other carriers, faced delays from suppliers. First- and business-class airplane seats throughout the industry have become so elaborate that they’ve held up deliveries of new aircraft. American’s new suites on the Boeing 787-9 will debut for regularly scheduled service on June 5 between its hub at Chicago O’Hare International Airport and London Heathrow Airport, followed by Philadelphia to London on Aug. 6 and Philadelphia to Zurich on Sept. 3. Another flight, outfitted with the new seats, between Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and Brisbane, Australia, is set to start Oct. 26. A roundtrip leaving Aug. 11 and returning Aug. 18 between Philadelphia and London in the “Flagship business class” costs $5,342 on American’s website. The 787-9 cabin will feature 51 of the “Flagship Suites,” which will be the new international business class. The carrier’s 787-9s currently have 30 Flagship business-class seats, 21 premium economy, 34 extra-legroom seats and 200 in standard economy. American said in 2022 that it plans to get rid of its international first class on many of its planes in favor of the larger single premium cabin at the front of the plane. It’s retrofitting older 777-300ER jets and will have a similar, but smaller, layout on its Airbus A321XLRs. The craze of offering sliding doors has rippled through the industry. Rivals like JetBlue Airways have upgraded their highest-end cabins to feature the doors, while Santiago, Chile-based Latam Airlines said Thursday that it started operating its new business class with sliding doors on some of its aircraft, part of a $360 million fleet refresh. Delta Air Lines’ Delta One suites offer the feature and United Airlines is rumored to soon unveil upgraded premium seating that could feature sliding doors as well. United didn’t immediately comment. American is also upgrading other amenities, like offering free Wi-Fi to its loyalty program members, which Delta already does and United is set to provide this year.","Leslie Josephs, CNBC","May 2, 2025, 7:29 PM GMT+2 / Source: CNBC"
Jeff Bezos discloses plan to sell up to $4.8 billion in Amazon stock,"Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 but remains Amazon’s top shareholder, is selling the shares as part of a trading plan adopted on March 4, the filing states.",N/A,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/jeff-bezos-discloses-plan-sell-4point8-billion-amazon-stock-rcna204458,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 25 million shares in the company over the next year, according to a financial filing on Friday. Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 but remains Amazon’s top shareholder, is selling the shares as part of a trading plan adopted on March 4, the filing states. The stake would be worth about $4.8 billion at the current price. The disclosure follows Amazon’s first-quarter earnings report late Thursday. While profit and revenue topped estimates, the company’s forecast for operating income in the current quarter came in below Wall Street’s expectations. The results show that Amazon is bracing for uncertainty related to President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs. The company landed in the crosshairs of the White House this week over a report that Amazon planned to show shoppers the cost of the tariffs. Trump personally called Bezos to complain, and Amazon clarified that no such change was coming. Bezos previously offloaded about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon shares last year, marking his first sale of company stock since 2021. Since handing over the Amazon CEO role to Andy Jassy, Bezos has spent more of his time on his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his $10 billion climate and biodiversity fund. He’s used Amazon share sales to help fund Blue Origin, as well as the Day One Fund, which he launched in September 2018 to provide education in low-income communities and combat homelessness.
